I think there are objectively more and less meaningful things, because meaning actually describes a quantity. It describes a very *nebulous* quantity, for sure(Meaning), but it's still a quantity and therefore it should follow that \"The least meaningful thing in the known universe\" must exist. The opposite must also exist. You can split hairs and say \"Perhaps there are ties for multiple meaningful\/meaningless\" things\" but in the end, meaning has to map onto a continuum when you consider the totality of all known, knowable, and unknowable but true\/conceptually sound information that exists.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1547087855,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"id":"edol8hh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_9pu4o5","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ecrsxy8","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/9pu4o5\/do_most_people_really_enjoy_their_life\/edol8hh\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1551138493,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public"}

One sometimes imagines they would instantly down the cup of perfectly peaceful drug if handed to them, but the reality is, few would.

I hope you don't stay confused for long. I want you to remember that narcissists are basically self-absorbed, domineering robots. They cannot genuinely care. They must feel like a boss. Never forgetting this will help you navigate life in a more sane way. The distress of having an N-parent is usually grounded in the fact that the child *expects* a normal parent. I wish I had a normal mother. This wish has led me to disappointment and shock more times than I can count. The sensation is like walking into the same wall, expecting a open path, thousands of times over. Imagine the insanity that sets in after the thousandth time. This is the bulls-eye here for *why* it's so stressful: Expectations. The key is to expect you're dealing with a **narcissist**. Expect psychopathic behavior, and you'll be able to make the best decisions for yourself without being blindsided.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1547088802,"distinguished":null,"edited":1547089099,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"id":"edomdkc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_aebocl","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_aebocl","permalink":"\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/aebocl\/wasnt_allowed_to_use_the_toilet_for_about_a_year\/edomdkc\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1551139029,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_type":"public"}
