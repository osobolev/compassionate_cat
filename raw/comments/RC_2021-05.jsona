We struggle to deal with paradoxes. We don't like it when things aren't 'neat'. This is why we really hate that one cliche quantum mechanics thing where the particle is both a wave and a particle at once, or both exists and doesn't exist at once. Many of us are at least bothered by this, on a fundamental level. Our brains are evolved to produce a narrative that makes sense to us. The problem is, reality is, in a narrow subjective sense, what we're experiencing, but it's also, in another sense, outside of our brains. And there's nothing about our brains that guarantees understanding *this* reality well. We're evolved for narratives, **not** for understanding reality. Narratives are what help us survive, and understanding reality(which is full of monsters, predators, horrible possibilities that vastly outnumber good outcomes, and irrationalities), is simply not good for human psychology, and this is why humans aren't particularly well evolved for understanding reality well. **That's** why what we label as 'mental illnesses' are so prevalent, even after seeming endless millennia of so-called 'evolution'.\n\nHave you ever seen a squirrel or some other small rodent in nature? It's essentially constantly paranoid. If we could hear it's inner monologue in human terms, it would sound something like this: \n\n&gt; \"What's that? WHAT'S THAT?! is that a hawk-- IS THAT A HAWK?! that's a FUCKING HAWKthatsafuckinghawkTHATS A FUCKING HAWK A HAWK A FUCKING HAKW okay no wait its just something rustlingNOWAITAFUCKINGjust some rustling Oh is this a good place to bury nuts?\n\n*1 minute pause*\n\n&gt; this is a good place to bury nuts.\"\n\nIf a psychiatrist were to diagnose this, a straight jacket and anti-psychotics would be in the patient's future(not my idea of 'treatment', personally). But this is just human bullshit, responding to behavior that has evolved after living in a truly mentally ill world. The things we call 'mental illnesses' are often *features*, not bugs. Yes, they can be pathological, and cause harm, but that doesn't mean they don't serve a purpose or say something about what we are or what our world is.\n\nWhat the *fuck* does this have to do with the dynamics of sexual attraction? Well, with BPD in particular, you repeatedly find this pattern of(mostly female) sufferers saying they are simultaneously seeking attention, and averse to attention. Like any of our behaviors, everything is an expression of genetic strategies in principle. If there's a thing we do, there's a gene that on some level relates to that behavior, from breathing, to being more social or less social. To being promiscuous or not. To being promiscuous **and then** not. This is how genes will express themselves ultimately, given enough time.\n\nDoes this cause suffering? Obviously, just like many other BPD behaviors do. It's still a bit taboo to say they cause the biggest victim of BPD(The **person** with BPD) suffering, but the average person familiar with BPD has no issues saying BPD causes *others* suffering. I think all of these details are important to begin to answer the question of why being wanted can be both bad and good-- some kind of \"Push and pull psychosis\". People with BPD *know* this behavior is insane, not just for themselves but also for others, otherwise we wouldn't get heartfelt posts about this on almost a daily basis. But the sad reality(it's sad for **all of us**, truly no one wins here), is the genes want you to make babies. Not just any baby, but the **best** baby. So you get this behavior set that tries to make babies, right? This is the promiscuity you're familiar with. This is the desire to be not just wanted but to really express sexuality in a way that turns heads. Right?\n\nBut then there's you. There's a **person**. The fucking **human being** who is aware of what this is and what it means. The person who is aware of the self-absorbed egomania of some stranger gawking at you. You *know* what he wants. How far will he go to get it? How scary can this get? If you've lived long enough you have a general idea of how far-- and this picture is **not** pretty. Sorry it took this much rambling to get to the point of OP's question, but **this** is the nature of the tension OP is describing between wanting to be wanted, and not wanting to be wanted. There's genes and then there's you, and they don't necessarily perfectly converge in their values, let's just say.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1619845338,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gwiegix","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n25c5k","locked":false,"name":"t1_gwiegix","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_n25c5k","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/n25c5k\/wanting_to_be_sexually_attractive_but_repulsed_at\/gwiegix\/","retrieved_utc":1628014615,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Many pessimistic AN's feel they are quite acquainted with horror. They've seen and read about the torture of humans and other animals, they've experienced ranges(sometimes very extreme ranges, unfortunately) of physical and or psychological pain. They've stared into the abyss, and said: \"No more. This ends with me.\"\n\nBut the dark, brutal truth for most people who say no to birth, is that occasionally on the individual level, and almost certainly on the large scale level, these actions will reliably distill greater evil in humanity. What happens in the long term with AN is, the most ethically minded people say no to reproduction. The least ethically minded(or the least intelligent\/aware to recognize the problems, both symptoms of the problem of bad luck), will aim to reproduce. What this does is it creates a world full of Ted Bundy's and Dodo birds, ripe for the picking. The psychopaths fight each other for power, and the helpless dodo birds(humans who are otherwise relatively *good* people, but lacking in cognitive\/awareness terms to recognize to stop bringing things into existence), get slaughtered and enslaved in this process. Is this what is *already* happening? Yes, of course, but it will be exacerbated in the long term by AN. AN is like the bottle of hand sanitizer, that promises to kill some portion of germs and bacteria(not kill, but in human terms, it's a memetic sterilization). The problem is this anti-bacterial never really does kill **all** the germs, does it? Some fraction of germs survive, and repopulate, with time. This sort of philosophical problem is **everywhere**, by the way-- you can form the same argument around any kind of activistic pessimistic ethical position. Promortalism, veganism-- this is everywhere. This \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" scenario. This is where we are. There's no bigger brutal truth than this.\n\nThat being said, people may think: \"But surely *one* has to be clearly *better* than the other, right?\" Well yes, I agree no two actions are likely to lead to identical scenarios in ethical terms-- but which one actually does in the totality of scope is deeply unintuitive for monkey brains like ours. This is the **core** problem-- are we damning the entire universe to hell by being AN? We simply can't know. Are we causing cows to suffer exponentially *more* by eating them *less*? What could be a more vomit inducing dark truth than such an idea being true?

I find men are just as eager to shit on other men. I'm not saying misandry doesn't exist in what you're describing of course-- all forms of 'gender hatred' appear to be thriving today. I'm sure being called an incel for a hormonal teen is brutal these days and preys on their insecurities, which have been *thoroughly* engineered into them to some degree(both genders suffer deeply from this problem, in different ways), but when I was a hormonal teenager who wasn't getting laid, the synonym was simply \"virgin\". The kids who got laid called the kids who didn't get laid, virgins, and it was a slur towards boys mostly. The slur towards girls was some other label that deemed them untouchable or nonviable as an object of sexual desire-- fat, ugly, etc-- whatever went against the status quo of male sexual desire(this isn't to suggest some sort of patriarchy-- female sexual desire is simply the other side of this coin).\n\nThis is interesting at minimum because I don't think calling a man \"ugly\" has quite the sting to it that calling a woman \"ugly\" has(I can only speculate here, being male), or vice-versa when it comes to calling a man a virgin vs. a woman. The genders seem to suffer from different issues, and also from different sets of antisocial dynamics that are expressed asymmetrically.\n\nEdit: I should have started with this point but:\n\n&gt; no one is really \"involuntarily\" celibate, a hooker costs 50$ or less..\n\nFirst I think it's the other way around-- no one *isn't* an incel to some degree. Even people who get laid frequently and with relatively low effort aren't living some sort of highly sexually idealized life. Getting laid versus getting laid ideally is a world of difference. Men who succeed in frequently getting laid know the sting of rejection better than anyone-- while people deemed \"incels\" get rejected in principle, men who get laid are rejected in practice. This is simply the par for the course when you're constantly looking for casual sex. They know it hurts to be rejected because they **are** rejected constantly-- this is why men are so often the perpetrators when it comes to calling others incels.\n\nSecondly I don't think this is the most meaningful use of the term \"incel\". When someone calls someone an incel, they aren't simply forgetting that prostitution is an option for everyone. The meaning of the term is in the accusation\/implication of being sexually unworthy. In this meaningful use of the term, the majority of the planet is probably sexually unworthy, but this is merely the arbitrary expression of genetic values, and not some ultimate value. \n\nThere's nothing special about genes that somehow closed the case on what good and bad human traits are until the end of time. If this were to be true, the \"ultimate woman\" would be a submissive and highly physically and psychologically sexualized(all the relevant parts that signal sexual fitness) woman with a never ending desire to satisfy the male libido and , and the \"ultimate man\" would be someone who looked like Jason Momoa but with a hundred times more charisma, and Warren Buffet's net worth, while especially having a knack for being endeared by\/towards children.\n\nSome of these features are more important to us than others(for instance, men seem to prefer a deranged but beautiful woman over a mentally healthy but ugly woman while women seem to frequently prefer a deeply cruel and cold but wealthy+socially dominant man over a kind but poor+socially weak man) , in general, but this is not because we're good at judging what's important. It's purely the happenstance of what the genes care about. Genes care about breasts and bank accounts because these *happen* to trivially lead to more genetic fitness-- not because they're somehow \"good\" in any ultra meaningful sense. This is why the term \"incel\" is so empty-- it's like a bird slandering a fish because the fish can't make nests in trees and fly-- it's purely arbitrary.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1619850201,"distinguished":null,"edited":1619852167.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gwikid9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n1syml","locked":false,"name":"t1_gwikid9","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_gwf5c28","permalink":"\/r\/Celibacy\/comments\/n1syml\/re_incels\/gwikid9\/","retrieved_utc":1628014352,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Celibacy","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro6b","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Consent doesn't matter when both suffering and pleasure are given to someone, so consent shouldn't matter in procreation. Consent should matter when only suffering is given to someone, which is the case with breaking someone's arm, raping someone, etc.\n\nThe reason why consent matters so much is because of the nature of the act of forcing **anything** onto someone. Forcing something onto someone, entails a kind of presumption that we find unacceptable due to how often things turn out other than how we'd expect, **except** in the most obvious cases(This isn't black and white-- we'd like you to presume to save our lives if we're choking to death on a piece of food infront of you-- there's an epistemological threshold here, based around norms).\n\n But if I think LSD is good for people, even if they have a terrible experience because that experience can be life transforming and immensely positive in the long run or something like that, there's something creepy and domineering about my **forcing them** to alter their mind this way.

The reason it's unintuitive is because it uniquely places the center of value on utility. Notice this is the ethics debate itself: \"What is valuable(ethically)?\" Utilitarianism's answer to this is: \"Utility\"., and those who find it unintuitive will do so on **this** ground, primarily. They think something that isn't perfectly characterized by the word \"Utility\" is *more* valuable.\n\nThis is why I think ethics is sort of doomed, to answer your question in an unfortunately contrived way. We prop up these hypotheses, like Util, or other systems, and then run these little experiments ontop of arbitrary systems. Not because ethics can only arbitrary, but because we haven't put the requisite work, or in the right way, to get to what actually matters in life, due to problems like the egocentric predicament and just the relative infancy of sciences related to human wellbeing-- we're dumb and immature, in other words.\n\nWhat we ought to do is not even ask questions *like* this, but we should just look at ethics as a values navigation problem first. Here's a grounding of what I really mean, to quote a single sentence:\n\n&gt; But really valuing all of those people seems to be the ultimate way to respect persons.\n\nWe don't even need much context for this sentence, I've already forgotten the sentences it is sandwiched between, but that doesn't even matter, we just need a Utilitarian context. In the event that our world really is *just* hell, and we ought to kill everything in sight as quickly, painlessly, and efficiently as possible-- this position(Util) is an ethical tragedy, isn't it? We're talking about values here, as if we're **already figured out** what value is-- Value, respecting people, surely means the opposite of killing everything! Yet... in the world where this is hell(We're talking a *true* hell, where every move forward is two steps backward, the road is not just paved by good intentions, all intentions support the **infrastructure** of the arrival point of said road, which has stopped at a dead end, to speak metaphorically) and exiting hell is an ethical emergency, we've already dug so deep into what values are that we're utterly myopic in seeing the world for something other than we we've already assumed it to be. This is the problem with ethics today, and with \"meta ethics\"-- we're utterly myopic. \n\nSo I propose everyone just stops doing meta-ethics, and simply speak of what the nature of reality is-- is it good, what should value look like in the context of this causal soup full of things that can suffer, and so on. Pure fundamentals, and not fragmentations of arbitrary hypothesis. Philosophy is too... bogged down in what is almost certainly nonsense, and almost anyone who has spent enough time in it knows this no matter their philosophical leanings, because they've certainly had some conversation attempts where the presuppositions and the semantic goo is so thick, it's impossible move in any cardinal direction. The solution is to put more emphasis on more fundamental questions, and less emphasis on metaethical calculations.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1619987611,"distinguished":null,"edited":1619988093.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gwpglet","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n13x9z","locked":false,"name":"t1_gwpglet","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_n13x9z","permalink":"\/r\/Utilitarianism\/comments\/n13x9z\/utiltiarianism_empathy_and_the_respect_for\/gwpglet\/","retrieved_utc":1628002589,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Utilitarianism","subreddit_id":"t5_2revn","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

It isn't. Intelligence does not get you to reality, it gets you data\/processing. If it did, ethics would be a directly parallel hierarchy to the intelligence hierarchy. Humans would be better behaved than less intelligent baboons-- but this isn't the case. Aren't we smarter than dumb things that tear themselves apart? It truly has nothing to do with intelligence to the point that it almost seems as if more intelligence *hurts*. People constantly do this-- with AN, with Veganism, they say \"How could someone who is otherwise so *smart* do this?\" And they're baffled. That's because it's not a matter of intelligence.\n\nThe bullseye is in other traits and phenomenology. How you exist, as a conscious thing. This ultimately determines the most valuable insight. This is an area of Harris's expertise, and I urge everyone to explore it, because it should worry everyone in the same way it should worry them that we're just popping things into existence, that we do not have a norm of training the human mind. This human mind which we see is so patently ill and frail-- we don't train it. Yet we many of us hit the gym to lift weights no problem.

It seems to me that reasonably high intelligence, alone and by itself, should be causing people to act better and smarter than they do now. So, a 180 IQ, by itself, is definitely not nothing. \n\nSee, even I can't resist this mistake from time to time. I think something like \"Oh but with high intelligence you can get certain facts and rules and combine them and eventually you'll get suffering=bad!\"\n\nBut no, unfortunately, this is not how things work. It's a very powerful illusion that many of us are subject to. Here's the analogy: If intelligence is the key, then it can't be true that deeply intelligent things are ethical things. Intelligence is clearly a factor-- it's nonsensical for us to say rocks can be ethical, because as far as we know, they aren't intelligent. So its a piece. But not the bullseye. The bullseye really is other traits, if we're not talking about ethics by accident. We don't care about the psychopath CEO who greedily buys cheaper antibiotics which fail to work for his cattle business, causing a cow plague that kills 99% of cows on Earth and cripples a large part of the factory farm industry-- this would be a pro-social psychopathic blessing at least in the short term. We care about *actual* ethical beings, and what they look like. A certain amount of intelligence is needed, but the real thing that dictates this is the presence of good\/bad traits-- if one is manipulative, deceptive, charming, self-absorbed, and possesses all the traits of evil, they can be **as intelligent as you want**, and they *still* won't be ethical. Give a shark 180 IQ and it's *still* a shark. It's still hungering, it's still predatory. There's nothing about that intelligence that makes the shark go \"I will *stop* being predatory now\". Yes, the shark can gain awareness to facts like \"Being a predator makes me reviled by the things I terrorize\" and he can incorporate this knowledge into his strategy, making him a more efficient and calculating predator, but ultimately what will make the shark ethical is changing the predatory traits, not the IQ. You can change the traits and keep the IQ the same, and like magic, the ethics is there to be found. Try this same experiment, but with humans.

But in principle, no, because the ultimate *cause* of the things you're talking about; \"arrogance\/humility\", \"empathy\/lack of\", etc, are **traits** independent of IQ. IQ isn't a magic quantity that just makes some thing *better* or *worse*, like some people want to believe. This is why you can have, in principle, really kind or evil stupid people, and really kind or evil intelligent people. The core of what people call evil, both fictionally, philosophically, and clinically, is what we colloquially call 'psychopathy'. Notice the two traits you're interested in here(lack of empathy\/arrogance), among the others which are, but not limited to:\n\n* Domination\n* Deception\n* Sadomasochism\n* Manipulation\n* Charm, \n\nare in this trait set. The two traits you're talking about(empathy\/arrogance), share other adjacent traits to the archetype of evil: Self-aggrandizing behavior(I'm powerful, I'm important), narcissism, egocentrism, callousness, self-absorption, and so on. This psychopathic trait set can have intelligence, but it's just not needed in the recipe because the psychopath functions fine without any particular special intelligence. They can be cunning and intelligent, it's just not *needed*, because they don't need to process anything special. To do *that* evolutionary trick, they have *other* traits:\n\n* fearlessness\n* comorbidity with schizophrenic thinking(a strategy to see patterns where there are none-- Richard Kulkinski is a famous case of ASPD + PPD)\n* low risk-aversion\n* (the aforementioned) sadomasochism\n* a lack of self-awareness\n\nWhen you have these, along side all the egocentric traits like the arrogance we're discussing, you don't need any special intelligence for crunching numbers or understanding genetics. You just find your victim(patterns in noise help, but this doesn't prevent you from seeing real patterns, like fear\/weakness), you're primed to dominate the victim with your toolkit,  and the rest of the machine drives itself. Notice this pattern in a basic predator, like a shark. A shark doesn't need intelligence in the same way a psychopath doesn't. A shark with a highly sentient experience like ours functions very similarly in external terms-- it *still* terrorizes you. This is the parsimony of evolution. Notice also if we give this shark 180 IQ, it's **still a shark** at the end of the day. 180 IQ doesn't magically make predatory motivations go away, but it *could* help mask them, which is what happens in the most intelligent human psychopaths.\n\n**Edit**: I read some the posts in this thread and I just want to touch on a tangent to avoid misleading information: It's constantly stated here that psychopaths, on average, have average or below average IQ-- even if this is true(which I'm personally skeptical of, although totally open to it being true), it's simply not terribly relevant to the main point. The most powerful thing that can exist in game theoretical terms is a high IQ psychopath. You should not therefore create an association in your brain that says Psychopaths = Stupid. The idea that psychopaths are deeply cunning has much truth to it, and this is why it's so difficult to scientifically quantify intelligence in these subjects. The science is almost certainly meaningfully flawed here, because we get these psychopaths a) post crime, where they often resort to a variety of strategies as the victim rather than in their natural niche of predator, or b) we only observe the psychopaths that **get caught**, so our sample is biased, among other ways that our institutions just are particularly poorly equipped to nail down something like psychopathy.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1620248002,"distinguished":null,"edited":1620252285.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gx2mefo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n5f4xm","locked":false,"name":"t1_gx2mefo","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_n5f4xm","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/n5f4xm\/do_you_think_that_higher_iq_makes_a_person_more\/gx2mefo\/","retrieved_utc":1627981484,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

This doesn't mean that, as a man, you are some sort of steel-minded monk when sexually provoked, but it does mean that your resistance is probably better than in a scenario where sex is purely a taboo and even the slightest showing of skin or suggestivity turns your brain to mush, because this is the culture you've been raised in. \n\nBoth genders have it bad here, some more than others depending on how you calibrate the sexual norms in the culture. Since I'm biased by being male, imagine for a second how hard a woman with good intentions has it here: She has to compete with the endless novelty and dopaminergic optimization of online porn. She has to both resist being called a slut while simultaneously resist appearing like a prude during all of this-- there's nothing necessarily wrong with these things ethically, but in the context of sexual strategies nothing really stands out as satisfying. Lose - lose.\n\nOn the flipside, men have to compete with sex toys(which seem fairly unevenly distributed and oriented towards female pleasure) and **much** higher standards of judgement and performance that lead to actual sexual selection, arousal, and orgasm. These conditions make the average person in a hetero context miserable and impotent.\n\nSo when it comes to ED and porn-- if you're jerking off all the time, then while you've unknowingly attempted to solve some of the more sinister and manipulative elements of female sexuality, you've also likely diminished a desire to get acquainted in the real thing. Your fantasies have been fulfilled virtually, now the woman who can't compete with rapid scrolling and fast forwarding of tailored sexuality cannot get you aroused\/you cannot get aroused with her, and if you can, perhaps you can't maintain your erection. Women suffer something too-- this isn't simply a male problem of ED, women famously struggle with simply getting off to sex in an age where we know more about sex than ever, so I stress that really everyone(in the average category) loses here.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1620268887,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gx3ujcp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n2xjnm","locked":false,"name":"t1_gx3ujcp","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_n2xjnm","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/n2xjnm\/is_pornography_causing_an_epidemic_of_erectile\/gx3ujcp\/","retrieved_utc":1627979621,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

If there's no foundation to be passionate about antinatalism, there is no foundation for passion about **any** philosophical position. Many people operate under some gradation of pragmatic vs. idealistic epistemology. What this means, they either lean towards \"it's impossible to know\" or \"it's possible to know\". The farthest end here is Solipsism or something similar, where the only thing we can \"passionately know\", is that we exist, which seems to be the only self-evident truth there is. Every other supposition we make can be a confusion but this one. Some adjacent versions deny reality or truth or consciousness completely.\n\nThe other is some version of realism, where reality is real, truths are knowable, and so on.\n\nThe problem here is we're always playing a game with words, and our motivations are just neither coherent or good intentioned all the time. We flip around between these two values as we go from one sentence to the other, or one day to the other, or one argument to the other, and no one can make sense of what the other is talking about.\n\nSolipsism is a perfectly fine hypothesis if we want to be super rigorous, but we can't get very far if this is all we suppose. This is why it's not pragmatic. So we all move through our lives with some degree of pragmatism: 2+2=4. The sun has risen. I'm in pain right now. Pain is bad, but the worst pain is *really* bad.\n\nWhat happens is, we often take our values with this degree of pragmatism, but when critiquing the values of others, we apply the solipsistic value system of: \"But how can we *really* know?\" This is short sighted at best, and dishonest\/malicious at worst, but this is just how humans tend to function. This reveals itself endlessly, often in very complex ways that are hard even for experts to detect in just about all philosophical problems that exist today to some degree, and even in the crown jewel of our intellectual pursuits: Science.\n\nSo again, are we passionate about anything other than \"I am conscious right now?\", and does it make sense? If so, anything that appears to cohere with reality, is viable for passion. From here, the argumentation can never be \"Is it *really* right to be confident about this thing?\" because you can use this style of \"Argument\" against propositions yet not hold propositions you yourself believe to be true to this same standard(or if you do, you just get stuck on solipsism and never get anywhere).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1620319419,"distinguished":null,"edited":1620319613.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gx62osp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n5zx9v","locked":false,"name":"t1_gx62osp","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_n5zx9v","permalink":"\/r\/AskAnAntinatalist\/comments\/n5zx9v\/arent_there_too_many_unknowns_to_be_passionate\/gx62osp\/","retrieved_utc":1627976202,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskAnAntinatalist","subreddit_id":"t5_287k4n","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Yes, you *are* technically lazy, like many of us are, but this is caused by gaslighting from a sick society. In a sane world, you'd naturally be motivated for cooperative and ethical behavior. But you're in a Kafkaesque hellworld that tells you its virtuous to suffer while those in power benefit, so you have a constant aversion to things, which is then turned around on you as a character flaw, conveniently, by those in power. Conveniently, the traits of those in power, are virtues:\n\n* Strength\n* Fearlessness\n* Cunning\n* Charm\n\nUpon close examination, it's only really possible to ascend the throne of Earth by being a psychopath.\n\nA helpful mnemonic tool: [DARVO](https:\/\/dynamic.uoregon.edu\/jjf\/defineDARVO.html)\n\nEdit: A clarification, because I just realized that I don't want to sound like I'm advocating something I'm not-- DARVO is a kind of red flag that one is engaging with a psychopath. This is often framed in a context of sexual assault, as in blaming the victim, but it's the simple conversation style of how you can know psychopathic behavior is probably being expressed. To be in conversation with a psychopath, you feel a kind of \"turning of the tables\", like they're performing some magic spell on you and the world. If you have your lunch stolen, and the sane thing is a world where lunches are not simply stolen from people without some *very* good reasons, and you know who did it, and confront them about this, and then they deny this(I didn't take it!), then attack you(How *dare* you accuse me?!), and then re-frame the entire ordeal where you are the perpetrator of crime and they are the victim, *this* convoluted little game is expressed. It is also possible for it to genuinely be the case, in that the psychopath could also be the person pretending to have their lunch stolen, and then accuse an innocent person, and of course, upon identifying the true perpetrator, the victim now appears to be the psychopath. It's also possible for *two* psychopaths to each be expressing this dishonest and manipulative engagement with **each other**(This appears to be everywhere in human politics). This head-spinning hell is what psychopathy *thrives* in, because it doesn't care about right or wrong, it's just an evolutionary system that tries to win at any cost.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1620330706,"distinguished":null,"edited":1620412879.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gx6tyad","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n6633v","locked":false,"name":"t1_gx6tyad","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_gx5o4ig","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/n6633v\/when_they_feel_justified_to_tell_you_to_hurry\/gx6tyad\/","retrieved_utc":1627975047,"score":232,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[]}

The \"they have no idea\" part, specifically. A lack of self-awareness is often attributed to psychopaths, but there are other traits that function similarly here. We associate psychopathy with fearlessness, no\/low risk-aversion, impulsivity, and so on. If you can't recognize the gravity of the situation, then there's one fewer thing stopping you from doing something evil. If you can't reflect on what you are, if you can't value right and wrong, if you can't stop and think \"Hmmm... is this *really* the right move?\" In a way that accounts for something *other* than your own ego, well then... there's not much stopping you from doing *anything*, is there?\n\nEven in a context of total selfishness, notice. The risk to *themselves* is turned off. Not even death or torture is a deterrent. Ted Bundy fiercely claimed he was innocent even moments before execution. He was a pathological liar, and not in the sense that he was fully aware inside by the way-- he had to believe his own lies to be that \"good\", but then also have a brain that could move to some other compartment and say \"Yes, I killed and raped those dozens of women\".

They are highly unaware of the impact they have. They live in an egocentric fantasy world, like all of us do, except they wield more power so the consequences of their actions reverberate through earth in a way that our actions don't often reach. To a degree, the entire human species is psychopathic, it's just through sheer happenstance of the laws of reality that psychopaths reliably sit at the top of the pyramid(from this vantage point, they engineer and secretly promote memes that sounds like \"Power to the people!\", because this lie ultimately benefits them-- if \"the people\" recognized they *can't* have power, this would be dangerous for them). The same mechanisms that cause them to be evil are in us. In some cases, in some narrow way, we're as bad. We're completely self-absorbed. We're completely dishonest about our motives. We lie to ourselves and others with such grace to justify our views and actions. We justify our malice towards those we deem as \"the other\", when none of us made ourselves. Clearly there are gradations of monsters on Earth, but many of us are just too eager to consider ourselves saints when detecting where\/who\/why the monsters are. And again, no one has even the slightest hand in making themselves. What are the implications of this in ethical terms?\n\n&gt; They know.\n\nUnfortunately not.\n\n&gt; They know the impact by now.\n\nNot only do they not know 'by now', they will *never* know, unfortunately, that is the paradox of psychopathy. Even if there were a pill that cured them, they would use their power to reject it and destroy it and wipe the values that caused a world to pursue such a pill from the planet. And they would succeed, because nothing has a stronger relationship to power than psychopathy. The psychopath is perhaps one of the most tragic victims of itself-- it is the height of egomania in our universe, a \"desire to win\", yet the most meaningful winning that exists, is out of its reach because it is so pathologically and *efficiently*(these are not contradictions-- the sickness happens to be the peak of performance) oriented to dominate everything.\n\n&gt; They don't care.\n\nYou're absolutely right here.

Benevolence *could* have taken over Earth by now, surely. Surely with social engineering, memetics, psychological sciences, pharmacology(consider what a \"National MDMA Day\" would do to us), and so on.\n\nYet... this world appears purely superficial and purely dominated by obscured evil.

Why is this just a side project, or a superficial signalling, as the world is tortured by malicious psychopaths on a daily basis? This is because this ethical signal which you're taught from a young age is a **lie** that benefits the strong. The lie specifically, is not that ethics isn't a real idea, with truths in it, but the lie is that \"The project that humanity is engaging on this planet has *good* intentions\". The project humanity is engaging in is **purely** about power and how to best strategically express it. It has **nothing** to do with ethics.\n\nEdit: I think your title question is a separate subject:\n\n&gt; If every person on the planet was an antinatalist, could it end up causing more harm than good?\n\nYes, in the conditions that cause this to happen, we'd need an ethical truth of soft antinatalism or the out right ethical falsity of antinatalism. Examples of this would be a world where AN is technically true in some narrow sense, or scope, so for example it could be true that creating life generally leads to more harm than good. But in certain cases, it's application becomes paradoxical in the grand scheme. Either because specific acts of natalism cause a reduction or suffering in practice but we're unable to identify which ones or how, or because antinatalism only reduces short term\/small scale\/narrow scope suffering(aka, only earth, only humanity-- which leaves those who suffer in some \"further\" area of spacetime to suffer needlessly) or because antinatalism paradoxically *increases* suffering in its application(if ethically oriented things stop reproducing, it's possible that unethical modes more aggressively proliferate in the universe and cause more suffering).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1620421902,"distinguished":null,"edited":1620439060.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gxbhpb0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n6ey61","locked":false,"name":"t1_gxbhpb0","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_n6ey61","permalink":"\/r\/AskAnAntinatalist\/comments\/n6ey61\/if_every_person_on_the_planet_was_an_antinatalist\/gxbhpb0\/","retrieved_utc":1627967701,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskAnAntinatalist","subreddit_id":"t5_287k4n","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

It seems to be naiive about the potential ethical disparities in the context of scope or in the context of what it means to be human. The latter of those first:\n\nI don't have any fantasies, unlike with in vogue politics, that the poor are somehow significantly ethically superior to the rich, either intrinsically or otherwise. This is specifically in the sense of the fantasy that goes, \"If you *just* put the poor and weak into power, we'd be much better off than with these selfish evil rich people!\" This is a child's fantasy, expressed politically. Humans appear to me to be on whole, oriented for evil thoughts and behaviors, as a function of evolution, and a function of what best wins games with no referee(skillful cheating which is perfected via selection pressure), which are precisely the conditions of our world. There's nothing especially demonic here when it comes to humans, misanthropes are confused and have detected a very narrow pattern-- all replicating beings in our universe will suffer this same fate, or be destroyed\/dominated by something that embodies it better. \n\nBut there is something to be said about egocentrism and cheating in practice-- the rich\/powerful are in this position for a reason, and it's because they're \"highly ranked\" right now in unethical expressions, again in the context of our little referee-less game. The rich and powerful have been engineering our world since well before anyone could coherently express the terms \"rich and powerful\". They are the primary force that has impinged on every other suffering thing on our planet. They have given the okay for every [war](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KLpM0bo.jpeg). They have engineered the most efficient tortures which no lone actor or small group could ever achieve, from the [Spanish Inquisition](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/pipI0fY.jpg) to the [Chinese \"cultural\" revolution](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/). \n\nBenatar writes here as if this isn't the case, or if this can't paradoxically engineer an even more mentally ill world than we've already been given under the stewardship of the most egocentrically successful humans our Earth has seen, their descendants, and those of us who climbed up the ranks and perfected their psychopathy enough to dethrone them. Of course, none of this seems to matter, because you have no choice whatsoever. Pretending like we have a meaningful voice in the matter is like pretending the [Wildebeast](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall) has a voice. Perhaps all of us, Benatar in his academic journal, and us here on reddit, are just like songbirds here singing trivial songs to each other as the sun rises over Hiroshima on August 6th 1945.\n\nIn the context of scope, all natalism to Benatar appears to cause harm in the short term( the life of the individual and the individuals they cause to exist or cause harm to) but we still can't account for what the world looks like if the most ethically minded people(boy is that a misleading way to phrase it) don't reproduce. I hope he's right of course because then it's easy, it's just a matter of not doing the wrong thing as a form of some very peculiar, neat deontology that appears to exist almost no where else in our world.

More ideas = good, we take the following for granted. But even philosophers have brought up the possibility that some ideas are bad, and this appears to be the founding concern with existential risk. The worst case scenario of this sort of phenomenon would be a world where **all** efforts at progress, lead to unethical outcomes, in some sort of paradoxical hell, where every step forward is at minimum, 1 step or more, backwards(this may not be immediately obvious, but would be the case when perfectly accounting for scope\/scale). For instance, if the few thousand humans that repopulated Earth knew what the cost was for rocket ships and iPhones, (insert the immeasurable bad that has occurred on Earth, every child rape, every injustice, every cult of human torture, the way humans have treated non-human animals, etc ), what would it mean, in such a context, where scope\/scale are revealed, to say, \"No-- we must go *onward*\"? We never seem to ask if this attitude is psychopathic, or if psychopaths dictate the laws of human values in the same way they do in the non-human animal kingdom through the psychopathic trait of [deception](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) or the psychopathic trait of [domination](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall).\n\nIf this idea *were* true, it would be one of the most aggressively resisted ideas in existence, and I don't think this resistance is necessarily wrong or stubborn\/foolish. I think it's simply a values problem: What do you fear more-- scaffolding the infrastructure of hell, while pretending you can ascend from it when in practice it is impossible, or do you fear missing out on the opportunity to ascend from hell even if such a thing isn't possible, and even if the consequences may cause a worse hell?\n\nPsychology *simply* determines our values here as it does with any other value. Psychopathic traits(among countless other profiles) like sadomasochism, high\/low risk-aversion, fearlessness, egocentrism, callousness, etc, do some heavy lifting in how one intuits this problem. This is because our world is not simply \"A few bad apples\", but that eons of rape, murder, torture, lies, sold in a charismatic package cause the entire species to be psychopathic to one degree or another, with the monarchs of psychopathy reliably sitting at the apex of our pyramid.

This would be a function of your *traits*, no matter what they are. I think this is an insight to notice over this compelling illusion that tells you \"I am a rational, logical being\". This is true even if between the two of us, you're the more sane one here. The fact that such a pause(I'm making an assumption here) isn't operative in you, should *itself* give you more pause.

I think any trans-humanism in the meaningful sense(humans upgrading themselves) is more or less well underway by the most powerful people on the planet. There's another kind of trans-humanism, which is simply moving the bottom of the human pyramid into something useful for the top of the pyramid-- like how cows are engineered to produce more meat, and more milk, this is the sort of fate that awaits human beings. \n\nThe trans-humanism that is\/will occur is something along the lines that is written about in the book Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari, and not something like what most trans-humanists think will occur(it will be dystopian, like our current reality is, obscured by various narratives that reduce to \"Onwards!\"). I think given the nature of power, this project had to have been well underway for a long time now, because power is a special kind of privilege-- it's a privilege towards information, a privilege towards deciding what information goes where, etc. This is with some limits, of course. Secrets can spread, but the meme that secrets simply can't be kept therefore conspiracies fall apart, is untrue, because it fails to appreciate the proximity of the the secret to the highest source of power. It's sort of like a mafia. If you're in the mafia, telling the mafias secrets is *very* risky. If something goes wrong, things go *very* wrong. It works like this with ultimate power structures on Earth too, except with far worse consequences. The mafia is like a children's club by comparison the **the most powerful thing** on the planet Earth.\n\nWhat I'm referring to by \"gets so complex it transcends suffering\", has to do with the aforementioned bottom of the pyramid. The bottom of the pyramid is always trying to solve evil while the top exploits evil in some way(rationalizes, accepts, embraces, redefines, etc). Because of the gamification between the top and bottom, it's possible for the bottom to actually evolve(through memes or genes) some answer to the problem of suffering(suffering is not a problem for the top of hierarchy, since to arrive at the top of a hierarchy, sadomasochistic traits are required-- suffering is a means to an end for the top of Earth's hierarchy. This is why our reality is deliberately engineered to maximize suffering and suffering tolerance, so then the \"Best\" genes get chosen-- identical to the milk cow). So yes, something closer to Buddhist Nirvana, but secular, and a completely natural phenomenon.\n\n&gt;I think that some day technology can be able to relieve at least the most serious cases of suffering.\n\nHmmm. I think generally, technological\/pharmacological relief of suffering is a kind of \"bone thrown\", a distraction, or a small forfeiture for some greater benefit to what is ultimately, an evil hierarchy.

There's this fairly popular philosophical idea that just because something is internal, it is vacuous, or brittle, or by definition not meaningful. This general view and whatever argument supports it(there are a few) are the foundations for positions like nihilism, anti-realism, \"deconstruction\", the notion of 'meta-ethics', and anything else that similarly denies meaning(or calls it brittle), or denies objectivity(or says that subjectivity is *all* there is).\n\nA lot of the arguments from these positions are actually fair. Subjectivity does have a certain brittleness to it, as we can all clearly see any time we see another person hallucinate, or any time we're feel very right about something only to discover we were deeply wrong, or when we consider that we can't, in a truly reliable way, validate anything about reality outside of \"I am conscious at this precise moment\".\n\nThat being said, the core confusion in people who believe these things is they play a kind of epistemological game that jumps around between a value of pragmatism, vs. a value of idealism. This is a very complex move, so no one catches it-- not even the person suffering it. What does this all mean? To navigate reality, which is in the aforementioned \"we can't know anything\" context, we have to express some sort of value towards one of two general directions. We can value the ideal(that which is perfect) or we can value the pragmatic(that which \"works well enough\"). We constantly flip flop between these two values to get such semantic and epistemological entangling, that two people speaking the same language and doing philosophy, often have very little clue what the other is saying(but very often, both parties are convinced they do know what the other person is saying and that the party who is right in any given disagreement is the thing we call \"I\").\n\nIt's possible to sit there, in some solipsistic position saying \"Sorry pal, the only thing I know is that *I* exist\", and be perfectly content as an idealist. But you can't really get anything done using this framework. It's so pragmatic it completely paralyzes us. You can certainly argue against **literally any** view *other* than the specific solipsistic target in question, using this framework. It's perfect here, subjectively(ideal). The odds are very good that just about anyone reading this rejects this \"strategy\" for navigating reality. But what's really happening with \"reality denial\" philosophies like those I mentioned earlier, is very similar. They're a kind of highly sophisticated solipsism. In the same way that the Socratic method can be used to infinitely deconstruct something and never reach a conclusion, these methods will, subjectively, appear meaningful. But there's no good reason to think so if one adopts some pragmatism(notice how both solipsism and something like anti-realism can be used here).\n\nSolipsist: \"Why should I adopt pragmatism? You're just a figment of my imagination. Checkmate.\"\n\nNihilist: \"Why should I adopt pragmatism? This is merely your meaningless subjectivity, there are no values worth valuing\"\n\nYou can do this for countless positions, and it will seem like some sort of knock down argument, but it's really just a confused game played by beings with embedded traits and stealthily presupposed values. The value of logical consistency is inherent in these statements, because we're speaking a language, with a logical syntax, where if there are errors in the syntax, we *want* to improve it, to get to a clearer picture of coherency. This is implied , but reality-denying philosophies seem to just ignore this and smuggle genuine value into a system to then dismantle value. Naturally, I'm aware you can infinitely deconstruct this paragraph, but that shouldn't convince anyone of *anything*. Why? Because you can **infinitely deconstruct any paragraph**, *including* the paragraph that says \"The presence of infinitely deconstructable paragraphs suggests that it is meaningful to infinitely deconstruct paragraphs\". It's a more complex \"gotcha\" than solipsism, but we see the latter as juvenile philosophy but many of us get caught in the glue trap of the former. Why? The same reason young people feel a thrill when they discover solipsism-- Feeling like you have the \"ultimate argument\"(even if it's bad) feels good.\n\nOnce you get past all of this, subjectivity merely becomes objectivity-- there are subjective truths like \"I am writing this sentence\", but these are also objective truths. Anything subjective, is by definition also a description of the world, once you step out of solipsism and adjacent ways of thinking. Does this mean that dragons are real, just because someone hallucinates a dragon? No, but their suffering is real.\n\nWe're already reached meaning at this point, but there's even more beyond this-- ethical truth(*objective* ethical truth), etc. The problem at our stage of philosophical sophistication is people arrive at points like \"Ethics is an objective matter\" or \"There is no meaning because we're merely doomed to subjectivity\" and try to convince people of this when they're operating on wildly different values, traits, phenomenologies, and it's essentially like these two people, speaking the same language on the surface, are really just speaking two alien languages living into completely different universes.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1620847103,"distinguished":null,"edited":1620847557.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gxw1cam","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n9xz5d","locked":false,"name":"t1_gxw1cam","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_gxu70zr","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/n9xz5d\/a_warm_house_in_a_cold_winter\/gxw1cam\/","retrieved_utc":1627933613,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

In reverse order: If you spend enough time on r\/antinatalism(and I don't mean as some kind of natalist combatant trying to argue, I mean *as* an antinatalist), you'll discover that even with a group of people who recognizes immense suffering on the planet to a degree that they determine having more children is wrong, with a group where veganism and concern for all life is high, you still find truly baffling amounts of just sheer malice and smug moralization, even in the most benign cases. You'll find posts that just utterly fail to empathize with very basic human emotions. As long as they contain birth or children, immediately, all the nuance is lost, and the mob will tear the evil \"natalists\" to pieces. Spend enough time here and you'll understand how otherwise good people throughout history have been employed to do very evil things.\n\nRational-- I think this is just clearly not true if you look long enough at human psychology. We're deeply flawed by evolution and given this deeply corrupted wetware, we're frequently motivated to out compete each other(as opposed to getting this right-- this causes us to always feel right), our memory sucks, the cognitive biases are endless, we rationalize just about everything after the fact, we fail to imagine the experiences of others(because it's impossible to, as an ego), and so on. If antinatalists have some edge here, we'd really be splitting hairs to say so in the big picture.\n\nSmart-- I'm not even interested in this if it turns out to be true because I don't think intelligence is what its cracked up to be, for the simple fact that it is possible in principle to be the most intelligent person on the planet and still be deeply evil. There's nothing about intelligence that translates into ethics or rationality-- the more intelligent you are, the more intelligently you can deceive yourself with complex thinking and lies, and again, this is how humans tend to be wired. We're at a disadvantage cognitively to the point that intelligence can easily do more harm.\n\n&gt; If we take these very reasonable premises to be true, then wouldn't it be immoral to spread anti-natalism, as this spread would result in fewer people in a good position to reduce suffering?\n\nThis is a big concern, yes. Psychopaths and narcissists will tend to want to \"spread their seed\". These types *need* stimulation( this is why the drug of choice for psychopaths is almost always stimulant in nature, like cocaine or amphetamines-- a pattern I've noticed in life). Boredom is torture for the psychopath, because it means having a colossal ego impinge on itself. Evolution oriented them for the thrill of murdering\/dominating other beings-- without this, wars would have never been fought, people would have never been tortured, Capitalism would not exist with its endless shiny toys, etc. A psychopath *must* keep busy. They must do things like, say, plan for the seeding of the entire solar system, because that would be \"Great\", or something. It's all about conquest, domination, \"more\", \"bigger\", \"better\", \"faster\", \"ME\".\n\nIt could simply be the case that antinatalism is a non-zero sum answer for the ethical and the unethical. The ethical don't want to subject more beings to hell, the unethical want to crank the dial on psychopathy so they get to play gladiator war with the entire galaxy.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1620849042,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gxw67f4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nacjxs","locked":false,"name":"t1_gxw67f4","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_nacjxs","permalink":"\/r\/AskAnAntinatalist\/comments\/nacjxs\/idiocracy\/gxw67f4\/","retrieved_utc":1627933409,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskAnAntinatalist","subreddit_id":"t5_287k4n","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Rape is not illegal because of the consent part, although that's certainly relevant. Rape is illegal because it is evident how maliciously self-absorbed you need to be to actually force someone to have sex with you when it's clearly against their will. This level of malice isn't operative with birth, where almost always people are ignorant about the harm they cause in bringing children into existence. The fact is, most of the planet just isn't doing some kind of moral calculus or diagnosing whether reality is good or bad. They're just stuck in their own egocentric little dream, while generally having okay intentions.\n\nAnother reason is this temporal problem of things being technically unethical, but there being no practical way to enforce its ethics. We're in point A(unethical state), and we think point B(future ethical state), would be best. All we need to do is make the conditions related to A, illegal, and we get to B, right? This sounds very intuitive, but it is often a failure. Prohibition fails for a reason, even though alcohol probably causes more harm than good. If alcohol is worth losing despite its benefits, due to some moral cost we pay for its existence, it would be better if we all just understood this and let it die slowly. Giving people the death penalty for involving themselves in alcohol distribution or consumption would be a disaster that would paradoxically make reality *worse* rather than better, even if consumption plummeted.

You posting this on reddit, and the happenstance of me clicking on my \"Schizotypal\" subreddit toolbar link, caused me to click the post, and then caused me to press the buttons on my keyboard which I'm pressing at the moment of me writing this. This causes you, it is assumed, to be reading this at this moment(for you). All of this impinges on reality.\n\n All the conscious beings on Earth do not exist in a vacuum, their existence impinges on and is impinged on, at all times. That's what existence means. To add to this, we form a certain representation of reality. This representation then colors our lives. People sometimes say \"Fake it 'till you make it\" as a kind of cure-all to anyone experiencing a problem, and this really does seem to work if you can pull it off. The brain is much less a reality extractor than it is a narrative generator, if that makes sense. Our brains are *bad* at making sense of outside, our brains are *good* at coming up with **stories** from the inside. These *stories*, then **determine** what happens next, by definition, because we believe in the story so the story is the ultimate filter which paints the next \"slide\" of reality for us(insofar as we *believe* it). \n\nI'm not sure if this is even close to what you were meaning to ask, though. I think Schizotypals(and schizophrenics, and other pattern-seeking types) have a seemingly \"magical\" pattern detection sometimes. It's kind of like having an interpretation of reality that works sort of like a slot machine. A bunch of the stuff is wrong because it's just finding patterns everywhere, but sometimes it's right.

Always these stupid, blurry, cartoonish examples. So much \"Is it real, or is it fake?\" propaganda-like media. All the way from the War of The Worlds radio \"Hoax\", which was spearheaded by Davidson Taylor(Some CBS Executive who was once in charge of Eisenhower's **Psychological Warfare Division** in WWII). The Nazis, famous propaganda connoisseurs, were also quite obsessed with convincing people that UFO's were real.\n\nNow, we've reached the era of deepfakes, and very high sophistication. The most powerful people on the planet can **force** the Alien idea onto humanity, gradually, if they so wished. If you saw a stereotypical flying saucer land on the street right now, with little stereotypical black eyed aliens walk out, what would you believe? I know what I'd believe-- this is engineered by humans, because it's the most simple explanation. What would the majority of the planet believe? The people who have been force-fed alien memes through culture, through TV shows, Hollywood, etc. The intended effect-- look, Aliens are real *after all*! Can't you see? It's right in front of your eyes. What more evidence do you need? If you follow the ideas of writers like Ray Kurzweil or Yuval Noah Harari, it's at least conceivable that at some point of technological sophistication, the most powerful human beings will be able to completely fabricate reality for the bottom of the human hierarchy. \n\nMany people who are into UFO's worry that malevolent aliens could be out there. The power of such an alien is scary. Scary unknown technology. Can we even see them!? What could they do to us? Etc.\n\nHumans have known for thousands of years that fear is the primary motivator of an animal. Fear creates aggression and various other strategies. In the context of a society, fear often makes you compliant. This is why for millennia, the top dogs of Earth have always dangled the meme of \"The Apocalypse\" above our heads. God is angry! It's all going to end! And we, the priests, and the kings, *know* why God is mad. Here are his rules, it says so right here, in this human-written book. This doesn't end. \"The Y2K virus is coming in the year 2000! Planes will fall from the sky!\" or \"The Mayan calendar says it's all going to end in 2012!\" or \"We're polluting everything to the point that everything will be unlivable!\"(The fact that the last one is **true**, does not even matter here. It doesn't need to be true for it to have the primary effect of manipulating human behavior. The point people don't understand is that collapse is not scary in a vacuum-- these problems have solutions. What is scary in a vacuum is the psychological manipulation of billions of humans--  **That** has no solution).\n\nThis is an ancient trick with many forms. The scary thing isn't the powerful aliens with mysterious technology. The scary thing is right here on Earth-- the most powerful humans. Almost every idea you encounter is simply a distraction from the fact of **some humans** being completely in control of Earth right now, as it has been, for thousands of years, albeit in more local terms, like \"Empires\".","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1621282802,"distinguished":null,"edited":1621283373.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gyhk7bc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ndwrk9","locked":false,"name":"t1_gyhk7bc","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_ndwrk9","permalink":"\/r\/Schizotypal\/comments\/ndwrk9\/this_unidentified_aerial_phenomena_task_force_and\/gyhk7bc\/","retrieved_utc":1627897919,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizotypal","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlzo","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

All the way from the War of The Worlds radio \"Hoax\", which was spearheaded by Davidson Taylor(Some CBS Executive who was once in charge of Eisenhower's Psychological Warfare Division in WWII). The Nazis, famous propaganda connoisseurs, were also quite obsessed with convincing people that UFO's were real.\n\n&gt;Now, we've reached the era of deepfakes, and very high sophistication. The most powerful people on the planet can force the Alien idea onto humanity, gradually, if they so wished. If you saw a stereotypical flying saucer land on the street right now, with little stereotypical black eyed aliens walk out, what would you believe? I know what I'd believe-- this is engineered by humans, because it's the most simple explanation. What would the majority of the planet believe? The people who have been force-fed alien memes through culture, through TV shows, Hollywood, etc. The intended effect-- look, Aliens are real after all! Can't you see? It's right in front of your eyes. What more evidence do you need? If you follow the ideas of writers like Ray Kurzweil or Yuval Noah Harari, it's at least conceivable that at some point of technological sophistication, the most powerful human beings will be able to completely fabricate reality for the bottom of the human hierarchy.\n\n&gt;Many people who are into UFO's worry that malevolent aliens could be out there. The power of such an alien is scary. Scary unknown technology. Can we even see them!? What could they do to us? Etc.\n\n&gt;Humans have known for thousands of years that fear is the primary motivator of an animal. Fear creates aggression and various other strategies. In the context of a society, fear often makes you compliant. This is why for millennia, the top dogs of Earth have always dangled the meme of \"The Apocalypse\" above our heads. God is angry! It's all going to end! And we, the priests, and the kings, know why God is mad. Here are his rules, it says so right here, in this human-written book. This doesn't end. \"The Y2K virus is coming in the year 2000! Planes will fall from the sky!\" or \"The Mayan calendar says it's all going to end in 2012!\" or \"We're polluting everything to the point that everything will be unlivable!\"(The fact that the last one is true, does not even matter here. It doesn't need to be true for it to have the primary effect of manipulating human behavior. The point people don't understand is that collapse is not scary in a vacuum-- these problems have solutions. What is scary in a vacuum is the psychological manipulation of billions of humans-- That has no solution).\n\n&gt;This is an ancient trick with many forms. The scary thing isn't the powerful aliens with mysterious technology. The scary thing is right here on Earth-- the most powerful humans. Almost every idea you encounter is simply a distraction from the fact of some humans being completely in control of Earth right now, as it has been, for thousands of years, albeit in more local terms, like \"Empires\".","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1621352008,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gykvrur","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nemolf","locked":false,"name":"t1_gykvrur","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_nemolf","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/nemolf\/bombshell_ufo_report_us_military_encounters_ufos\/gykvrur\/","retrieved_utc":1627892837,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

After a certain threshold, one is paralyzing in a fit of vomiting or fainting, even when the solution to ending the suffering is trivial, which could in principle be something like pressing a button that administers a euthanasia drug.\n\nIt's pure psychological happenstance that those most in touch with reality and those most sensitive to \"badness\", could be in the worst positions to first properly process it, and second, do something about it.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1621435492,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gypanyp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nffvvz","locked":false,"name":"t1_gypanyp","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_nffvvz","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/nffvvz\/is_there_any_argument_against_pessimism\/gypanyp\/","retrieved_utc":1627886074,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Then, low and behold, crafts that behave exactly as he described start appearing around navy vessels and military jets\u203d\n\nSo there's several ideas of varying probabilities you're bring up. One idea you're bringing up is that the government could have access to something that makes new, truly revolutionary technology possible. This is one claim. This is not a crazy idea. But then to go from here and say \"The best explanation we have after this fact, is that the footage we're seeing in the deepfake era are Alien visitors that are either hilarious bad at camouflaging themselves, or hilariously bad at making their presence truly announced\" is a stretch. Is it possible? Of course. But what is more likely-- This entire Aliens narrative, with all its plot holes, or rather simply that clandestine government research produced powerful technology which created global hegemony(A scenario similar to where, if say, ancient Japan discovered atomic weapons by some sheer strange feat-- this would cause Japan to ultimately dominate planet Earth because no one else would be anywhere near matching them.)?\n\nThe more likely, the more parsimonious answer is going to be the second one here. The Alien stories you're seeing, I predict, are going to be **ultra** compelling propaganda that will, in the worst case scenario, completely engineer our reality, Matrix-style. But reality will still simply not be as it appears, because power will always write the narrative. This was true when Kings and Priests had the power they used to, and it's true for today's \"Kings and Priests\", whoever they are(notice we can't even *know* or *point* with any real confidence).

This is just with respect to fun, doing \"good\" shares a similar problem. My favorite is always \"The road to hell is paved with good intentions\". It's forever burned into my brain after watching some Elon Musk video where he was revealing his entire Neuralink enterprise and he said something I thought was either dead wrong or utterly confused. He said he thought that saying was untrue, and it was in fact that \"the road to hell was paved by *bad* intentions\". It seems now to me a semantic confusion, after carefully examining how a, to some degree, autistic individual would semantically parse a concept like \"bad intentions\" vs. a less autistic person. To me the saying really says: \"People who *believe* they're doing good, can so effortlessly do evil, causing paradoxical outcomes\". To him, I would imagine some kind of hyper-literal interpretation of what a \"bad intention\" is, or some such.

With ethics(what is good\/bad), I don't think it's simply a matter of perspective. I think ethics has to have something to do with conscious beings, to be logically coherent. It also has nothing to do with something which has no impact on conscious beings(even as an idea). If such a thing exists, that is beyond influencing our physics in any way, and beyond influencing our consciousness in any way, this is, by definition, objectively, in a very \"2+2=4 is not just true, but **objectively** true\" sort of way, the least ethically salient thing in the totality of existence, whatever that existence is.\n\nIt's possible to discover that ethics is domain of objective reality like any other field of science using this sort of intuition, although I think as long as humans are wildly differing in their traits(we can imagine things like the \"Big 5\" personality traits, or MBTI, or personality disorders, etc) we will never converge on ethics because we're all experiencing truly different representations of words in a way that numbers tend not to suffer from(which is why a phrase like 2+2=4 is generally agreed upon, although there's still lots of philosophical disagreement about the ontology and epistemology of math-- this should tell us how poorly oriented we are to converge).\n\nWith the case of  \"fun\", something almost everyone seems to intuitively think is perfectly subjective, like \"What is the best dessert?\", even here I think the way ethics is entangled with what we find enjoyable can't be escaped. It says something about someone if they find the squishy sounds of a hard object hitting a living child's skull over and over, \"Fun\". It's also possible to value the wrong things, or value them for the wrong reasons. A person can do something seemingly good, like offer to help a crying person on the street, but they can do in a way that is motivated by the worst intentions a human can have in this situation, like wanting to mug the person later because they'd be an easy victim. Whether or not anything \"good\" comes from this(it rarely does), is purely accidental and not genuine.\n\nAll of this of course will sound like nonsense to a person who deeply believes a proposition like \"There aren't *really* any facts about the world\".","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1621717602,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gz3f54y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nihxvl","locked":false,"name":"t1_gz3f54y","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_gz3d8iv","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/nihxvl\/qanon_black_panther_party\/gz3f54y\/","retrieved_utc":1627863400,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Do we just sit there, pushing the boulders in our paths as hard as we can with our untrained and frail limbs?\n\nWe live in a world that is similar to the boulder world, where 99% of the world does not understand the concept of strength training. So everyone's just tragically struggling to push these massive boulders, more boulders fall on them(many of them are pushed onto them *intentionally*, by other humans who think they're doing a terrible job at boulder pushing, or just for the fun of a stronger bully), and things get progressively worse, the harder people try to solve problems without the ability to solve problems.\n\nSo what do we do in boulder world? We stop pushing boulders, we first get bigger muscles. We may not be able to push all the boulders off right away, but if as many of us as possible just get stronger muscles, our odds certainly improve at pushing at least some of the smaller boulders.

There's no reason to think we can't measure egocentrism like we can any other trait in psychology, so it should be fairly easy to do still.\n\nIt seems very difficult to me to imagine someone who is rather detached from thoughts and emotions(and therefore, detached from a sense of self) strongly believing that we're truly morally responsible in a way that demands punishment, and in a way that pretends we really could have done otherwise than we did. I still believe in moral responsibility, just in a different sense than the one free will implies.\n\nClearly, there are other variables(like physics, psychology, neuroscience, -- all have something to say about free will being dubious to put it charitably), but these alone don't do it. This is why you have physicists who still believe in free will when they know that everything is causal(whether that is deterministic, non-deterministic, etc). All you should *really* need is this understanding of causality making free will impossible. So this leads me to believe that there's something about our psychology that produces this belief in free will, and I think it should be something *like* egocentrism. Again, the logic is all there, very plain to see. It's very similar to a belief in God. It's quite plain, by now, in 2021, that a belief in the sorts of Gods people still believe in today is wrong as a matter of what is literally true for countless reasons, yet it persists. It persists in otherwise smart people, or otherwise honest people, and so on.\n\nFree will is even easier, because there's much less of an emotional attachment due to what's on the line for some people with consequences for spirituality\/culture. Yet it still persists. Sometimes I think about the possibility that the smartest people I encounter who argue for free will seem to do it with some kind of stubborn resistance. Come to think of it, this is the exact feeling I get with the smartest people who argue for \"belief in belief\" when it comes to God. They both seem unable to plainly say what they really think:\n\n\"Yes, this is bullshit. But it's important bullshit, and I believe we're worse off if we abandon this bullshit!\"\n\nI'm open to the possibility, I just don't think it's true at this stage. The harm of religion is plain to see by now, but I actually think belief in Free Will causes more harm than any single idea on planet Earth.

I only have this somewhat convoluted explanation:\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moloch\n\nThe people who actually hold the authority to build or destroy the god-furnace of human sacrifice, are already \"beyond human\" or \"super-human\", in my view, but not according to modern scientific standards. Science lumps everyone in that society into the \"homo-sapiens\" category. Science also lumps Queen bees and worker bees into the same category, but it seems wrong to me. If Queen bees had total access to sophisticated bio\/genetic engineering, sophisticated AI they had control over, nanotech, etc-- they would simply cut out the worker bees. The worker bees really weren't bees. That, or, the Queen bees weren't really bees, or they were both bees but dramatically different species, incorrectly lumped together by semantic\/taxological confusion\/over-rigidity. The core problem is we can't get over the whole \"b-b-but they have the same genetic sequence!\" problem. I will get to this with another analogy at the end.\n\nAll the things the worker bees do could be replaced by the new super-bee Queen bees(with all their tech\/science). In fact, Queen bees are *already* super-bees-- they're just in an exploitation game where not everyone benefits the same way. Workers are a vestigial part of the species despite having the same genes as the queen. This is where we all are as humans too, here on this subreddit. We're like this deeply detached portion of humanity, that can be culled at any time because something that calls itself(and we call) \"Our species\", is really in a perfect position to murder and torture all of us(they *do* this, in fact, [all through out history](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/)).\n\nIt's a lot like how people think 1984 was some kind of warning. It was not, it was a description of what had *already* happened. No one seems to understand this book. Transhumanism is really the same thing-- it has happened a *very* long time ago, and you're not in that club. They rely on you believing that you'll be a cool immortal cyborg because they still need you to play nice until the worker bees are phased out-- there was never one unified \"Bee\"ity to begin with, it was just eat or be eaten until a vast disparate hierarchy was formed.\n\nBack to same genes=same species. If we imagined a world of humans who were tortured by something like the \"Great Old Ones\" from Lovecraft's fiction work, and it turned out that this world was the result of forcing these humans to breed in two ways, one way was to fuel the cosmic demon lords with some sort of vital essence, and the other was to serve as vessels to breed more demons like TGOO, but in this world, TGOO turned out to have the same genetic sequence that humans do, but the strange conditions of the world created this uttterly bizarre epigenetic phenomenon where the difference between the two beings was like the difference( in terms of appearance, behavior, etc) between humans and amoeba in our world, then science would technically call these two things \"One species\", and they'd have to say they're \"Working together\". I think this is something that science is just too rigid in their taxology on, and these two things would be so fundamentally different on a deeper philosophical level that they would not be the same species, despite superficially, \"sharing\" the same genetic sequence which was then modulated by some demonic world environment to create two dramatically different beings.\n\nThe above example is fictional, but the effect I'm describing with Queen bees and human elites vs. basic humans is not. I don't think these things are \"one species\".

People do things like conflate decisions, with **free** decisions. So one person is using decision in a way that implies \"Free decision\" and another person is using the word in a way that means \"decision\" in a way that is very strictly limited to a robotic arm running on an algorithmic flowchart moving up or down based on inputs from a camera. And then they use completely different definitions of words like \"free\". So to one person, having a gun to your head means you're not free, but to another person, having a gun to your head does. And then in another scenario, to one person, having no gun whatsoever but instead a quiet, large complex space to deliberate on endlessly, means you're free, but to another person, means you're still not free. We use the same words, but we mean different things. This is the egocentric predicament-- we're talking about roughly the same subject, but we may as well be running on two different copies of 'The Matrix'.\n\n2) Traits\/Phenomenology. We can differ quite vastly in how we experience the world, despite being the same species. One person could be highly egocentric, and another person could experience a sense of being that makes a sense of \"self\", brittle or nonsensical. These two types of people would get nowhere arguing about free will-- but again, this is just more of the Matrix. We already know from countless efforts from the field of Psychology that humans are pretty shit at knowing why they believe what they believe. We are good at forming narratives, not at being rational or deeply aware. We can hate something as an experience in the moment, but then the magic of memory and it's fickleness allows us to one day say \"Oh yeah, totally! I *love* that thing!\" because it benefits us somehow to believe this. Our traits determine what we value, and our values determine what we believe. We know this is how people gravitate towards political tribes already, and it's obvious in hindsight. *Of course* traits determine values. Of *course* if you're conscientious, you'll be more likely to be a republican or libertarian, and less likely to be a liberal. Obviously this does not mean that traits are the sole source that determines values. To some degree, there is of course feedback here. We could be convinced that we value pain, and after a long life of expressing this value, it's possible after many years we say for example: \n\n\"You know what? It took me a long time to understand this, but I think I was wrong about valuing pain all those years\" or \"Hmm, perhaps I value pain a *little* too much\"(as one stares at their self-amputated limbs). \n\n\nWhether or not one recognizes this is pure happenstance of environment and of the tenacity of these values. There's zero freedom there. So, now for the solution. The first one is the *easiest* one to solve. Humans have had meetings of minds on semantics for a long time now, so here we're really *simply* being lazy and self-absorbed. We're too interested in our own free will narrative, rather than the truth. We drop this nonsense, we really nail down our definitions, and we give it a more serious effort. But that's the good news. That's the easy part. The second problem can't be solved very easily today. To solve it, I think we need to be able to simulate different phenomenologies. We need to give someone who says there is no free will, a different kind of experience of reality that makes them feel like the people who feel they have free will do. We need to do the same the other way too, give people who believe in free will, the kind of experience that people who don't believe in free will experience. The closest we have to this second plan in our current arsenal are things like drugs which cause dissociation\/psychedelic experience(the fast and easy but dangerous\/more stigmatized route), things like mindfulness meditation(slow, hard\/high investment, less stigmatized), or the happenstance of extremely traumatic events. All of these can cause ego-loss, which can fairly reliably disrupt self-serving ideologies,  can trigger feelings of \"one-ness\", can trigger a sense that there is no self, and so on.\n\nWhen free will believers\/deniers reliably come out of these \"simulations\", having this newfound esoteric knowledge, and *still* say \"Yep, *all* of my prior arguments still hold up. I've accounted for these (totally new to me) experiences, and therefore, information, and my old model is stronger than ever, then we'll get closer to convergence on this topic. Until then, it'll just be Matrix A vs. Matrix B.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1621974691,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gzfn94e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nknmxi","locked":false,"name":"t1_gzfn94e","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_nknmxi","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/nknmxi\/a_thought_experiment_on_free_will\/gzfn94e\/","retrieved_utc":1627843014,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

I think there's a huge problem when we smuggle accountability into moral agency. Moral agency is one thing, more agency *with* accountability, is another. It's the latter that is incoherent in any causal universe, because the agent never picks anything about the substrate of causes from which they emerge. If they can't be responsible for what they are, then they can't be *ultimately* responsible for what they do. This is like someone covertly giving you a pill that turned you into a complete psychopath that went on to torture 20 people to death, and then some people decided to punish you for this. Not to isolate you by the way to prevent the risk of you getting slipped another evil pill(which would still be a bit of a joke when it came to \"justice\"), but actually because it's *really* your fault that you were in this position.

It seems couched in arbitrary terms no matter where we point. We could say \"the conditions of the universe\", independent of the parents choice(that is, the states of the universe which reliably generate suffering) are the root cause. These are many factors, of course, but our semantics here lump them together to create a singular, conceptual \"root\". Likewise with a parent, we have several ways to talk about this thing we're calling a \"parent\". There's the subjective conscious experience of the parent, there are the parents traits, the parents arbitrary neurology at the point of conception, the willingness to abort or not(and all impinging causality, culture, economic status, legality, etc).\n\nThis is why I think blaming anyone for anything is a confused idea. When we're in a causal soup, no one can truly be blamed for anything. Any attempt at blame will just be perspectivally, temporally(why stop at the parent? Wouldn't the grandparent be an even more fundamental *root* cause? Ad infinitum), and semantically arbitrary.\n\n&gt; I often feel that it's hypocritical for parents to say they wish they could take their kids' pain away -- like the sentiment in OP's post, my internal reaction is \"well, you could have done so; it is kiiinda your fault...\"\n\nFor me it's incoherent to tell someone they \"could have done so\", given what we know about the brain, genes, physics, psychology, etc. All one could have done is precisely what they did. If we rewind the universe to the point where you're *just* about to write your last response to me, there's no point at which you could have just said \"Hmm, you know what? It's actually time for lunch now.\" or \"You know what? I'm bored of reddit for the day\" or \"You know what, what's the point of writing this? We're all going to die some day\". I'm not endorsing these views, I'm just giving you examples of scenarios that were simply not in the cards for your brain at a neurological\/psychological\/physical level. Even if one tries to introduce some kind of quantum indeterminism, **you** still don't choose how quantum indeterminacy behaves, so that doesn't give you any ability \"to have done otherwise\", that'd just be some dice out of a mysterious void re-rolling for you.

I think the positions of optimism and pessimism are just not *equal* like they appear to be to us. We have this, probably culture, but otherwise general intuition, that our world is full of 'balanced forces'. Good and Evil. Glass half full, glass half empty. Chocolate, vanilla. Yin and Yang. Magical, perfect, balanced equilibrium. Except this intuition I think misleads us, because there's nothing about our world first of all that guarantees any kind of \"mystical balance\". One side could simply be better oriented to understand reality. Here's why I think that side are the pessimists:\n\nImagine the best experience possible on Earth, in practice. An experience that has happened. It is no doubt beyond worlds to describe the sheer waves of bliss and ecstasy. Perhaps the experience we're talking about is likely to be drug induced. This is perhaps the **peak** position, from which to be an optimist. If *this* experience is possible, then truly, anything is possible, and all those grumpy pessimists were astronomically wrong. Now, what would happen if we could interrupt this experience in a deeply jarring way, by simply *showing* the subject in peak bliss, some live footage of the **worst possible experience**. What would happen to this subject? What *could* happen? What would it say about this subject if they said something like, \"You know what, that's pretty bad, I'll admit--- but you know, this whole project we have here? Still worth it.\" in a perfectly calm and lucid tone? \"Life isn't made into a *mockery* by this experience in the least. If anything, this terrible thing *contextualizes* the bliss I'm experiencing.\" You'd have be completely deranged or evil to have this view. The only sane response is such sheer horror, that it actually turns the context of bliss, into a context of torture. We went from intense waves of pleasure almost no one in the history of the planet will ever experience, to gagging on our vomit and wishing for death, again, assuming we're not merely monkeys adapted to a hellworld here(the two methods for this are psychosis--lacking touch with reality, and psychopathy--lacking the traits and experience to concern oneself with matters ethically).\n\nNow what would happen if we do this to the worst experience? I'm not even talking about something [*really, really bad*](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KDf_aL_7QHI), where you'd be a monster to wish it on even the worst human being alive. I'm talking about one of the [**worst case scenarios**](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo) a human being an live through. Notice, first, there are no drugs involved that *create* this experience. If anything, drugs would be a blessing from heaven to *escape* the experience-- and this is even true for some of the worst drugs we have. The worst experience on Earth is experienced while perfectly sober and in touch with reality. If anything, the brain naturally shuts down things like memory and senses and psychological models, simply to make the appearance of how hellish everything is, **less** bad. And while the worst drug induced hallucination only lasts a short time, even if we account for time dilation, the worst torture can last a very long time, 20+ years in a case like [Elizabeth Fritzl's](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fritzl_case). But what happens if we interrupt the worst torture and misery, with a quick live feed of the best experience? The most incredible bliss or serenity? Notice the difference. Is everything better now? Does a twinkle in the eye appear? No, again it has practically the same effect-- it can easily *intensify* the torture, but at minimum it certainly doesn't make things better.\n\nThe conclusion: The worst misery on earth makes a mockery of the greatest bliss, where the greatest bliss doesn't even form a dent or scratch in absolving the worst misery. What this means is, people who are experiencing the worst misery really are *more in touch* with reality than people who are experiencing bliss. Bliss really is a hallucination where as misery is not. Misery can seem to be a kind of sobriety, sometimes. Of course, we can still hallucinate our own misery. A child who pulls a tantrum in a toy store because they didn't get a *second* toy, is simply confused about values.\n\nThere's a counterargument here I'll include because I think there's a chance all of this can be wrong. If both individuals are confused about experience, and suffering\/bliss are both two forms of some kind of hallucination, then what I said is untrue. This seems true to me and obvious for easy cases like *truly* small scale suffering: \"Oh no! They're out of my favorite snack!\" Like the child in the toy store, that kind of suffering seems to be a confusion related to thought\/identity\/values.

My current hypothesis is that this idea will function in the same way as the religions of the last several thousand years functioned: To control large numbers of conscious beings through propaganda and social engineering.\n\nAll you need to do is invent some reasoning that requires leaps of assumptions(and requires us to ignore all our potential ignorance on the subject) for the simulation that can neither be proven or falsified(check), and from there, you will have people believe in it. From this stage, you can build upon this meme in the same way religions built upon the meme of Religions: teach it to children. As the idea gains critical mass, you will then engineer(with your sophisticated technology), that the most powerful people on Earth can now communicate with the simulation engineers(Prophets talking to God), and history will repeat itself, just in more technologically advanced ways. Edit: I forgot a crucial step to the forming of a religious\/dogmatic system of control: Torture the heretics, kill the apostates, punish the sinners. This is where the system that professes itself to be the ultimate goodness, and the ultimate insight, becomes the ultimate evil, and the ultimate lie. This is a function of evil, this duality. Evil cannot simply look and sound evil. Evil has to pretend its ultimately good to have a real psychological impact of terror. What's scarier, a very powerful evil looking demon with sharp teeth and red eyes? Or a being of pure light which everyone else believes to be of pure goodness, but hidden with it, is the force of malice and sadism and egocentrism that the former demon has?

Belief in ideas is a form of power if you have the authority over the tenets of the belief system. Beings that are unequal, in a resource-finite space, organize themselves in power hierarchies that are pyramidal in structure. This much we know for certain.\n\nThere is no solution to the problem of power(synonymous with evil, because evil is just a form of ultimate power that is unbounded by ethics, where as goodness is a form of constrained power and constrained traits. Evil only needs one trait: Ultimate power to do **anything**). Only more power beats power, which is synonymous with saying bigger evil beats evil.

It has always seemed inconsistent to me to believe that people don't have choice in their actions AND to assign a negative ethical or moral position to an action.\n\nIt's a fine question. Is the question \"Does ethics exist\/Is ethics meaningful if no one can *freely* make choices?\" I'm going to assume it is, since this is a common belief, that no free means moral nihilism or moral anti-realism. The reason people think this way, is they're used this idea of people being truly worthy of punishment. For that idea to be coherent, they need to believe in this idea of \"free will\", right? Because if no one is worthy of punishment due to not being the author of themselves(which is what determines how one acts, thinks, etc-- if you **were** a turtle, or a child predator, or a kind person, or a homosexual, you'd quite literally act and think **like** a turtle\/child predator\/kind person\/homosexual -- you couldn't be anything *other* than what you *are*), then free will can't be real. So the logic is reverse engineered in a confused way, like this: \"If there is no free will, then nothing matters\/nothing is ethically salient.\" But this idea is wrong, because ethics actually is not contingent on the freedom to act. Ethics is contingent on variables like fairness, harm, suffering, intention, and so on-- not freedom to make choices. Freedom to make choices is what *punishment* is contingent on, and people conflate punishment with ethics.\n\n&gt; I would go crazy and not be able to function as a person and a part of society otherwise. \n\nI'm curious what you imagine this to be like, if you don't mind sharing.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622172743,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gzpv8wf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nl6no1","locked":false,"name":"t1_gzpv8wf","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_gzp4917","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/nl6no1\/i_wish_i_could_take_all_my_childs_pain_away\/gzpv8wf\/","retrieved_utc":1627825971,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

There's a lot of damage that this heuristic does because it makes very straightforward facts about reality seem unhinged. There's simply a hierarchy to the planet, and it's not the case that secrets from the very top of this hierarchy simply *pour* themselves out making any kind of collusion to control the planet impossible. There's a lot of disorder and contention to control the planet, but there's also quite a lot of order and control over the planet that we can be certain of, and also certainly that we're not aware of. What is the inner experience of the highest levels of something like the CIA *like*, for instance? Even raising the question has pretty serious stigma to it, and while there are some good reasons for this(it filters the endless bad ideas associated with these sorts of ideas) it makes it practically a certainty that any discovery of a top down conspiracy becomes difficult to impossible to untangle from the bottom up.

For the more adapted, things seem fine. Good. Great, even. (There's an obvious feedback loop where one can fake it until they make it, even without *knowing* they're faking it, since it's safe to say self-deception is in every human mind). For the less adapted, life can feel awful, and there are many ways to fail to cope with these feelings. Ignoring it, taking drugs(both things like antidepressants, the age old classic alcohol) ruminating incessantly, and so on.\n\nWorst of all, you'll feel as if the world around you is gaslighting you when they you \"Everything looks fine from this end! Things don't seem to be as bad as you make it out to be! Working as intended!\" Sounds familiar?\n\nThis is because you're speaking to highly adapted people. There's a mild to moderate \"lunatics run the asylum\" effect here on Earth, unfortunately(for everyone: being adapted to a bad world is not *good*, necessarily, because as helpful as it is to \"win\" in the game of \"life\", it can often cause one to fail to value what matters, and being poorly adapted to a bad world is clearly traumatic-- everyone loses something important here).\n\nI would personally investigate meditation more. The reason why this option is the most attractive to me, is a) it's among the safest(although nothing on our planet is perfectly safe) and b) it doesn't delude you in the way an antidepressant would(Although it can work for some people and should be given a fair try, it forcefully makes you feel like things are alright, and there's something fishy about that to me). With training your attention, it's possible to be sensitive to reality but also not suffer from a bad reality. It'll be unintuitive barring the required esoteric knowledge, but it has to do with identity, and it functions in similar way to how psychedelics and dissociatives have therapeutic value, by giving you a break from that constant identification(emotions hold a kind of magic spell over us in that they cause us to lose all of our attention and miss certain insights about the mind-- if you t rain attention, you train away the identification to thought\/emotion, which interrupts or shortens the magic spell). This \"break\" creates lasting insight, if that makes sense. Notice how antidepressants or alcohol don't really do this(it goes without saying that these are dramatically different substances on many levels which mostly just share a forced signal of \"Things are good now\"), which is why they aren't often touted in the same miraculous language as some other substances that dramatically thrash around our models of identity like LSD or Ketamine does.

I've never actually heard a good one that's commonly used, maybe my problem is I'm watching lots of vegan youtube(mostly AskYourself) so it's probably just people who haven't thought it through versus his very formal(too formal?) style. That being said, I also find many of the arguments *for* veganism bad, or problematic. Stopping animal torture as quickly and efficiently is a high priority, but it's not at all clear to me that simply going to the supermarket, and voting for the plants vs. the animals does as much good as we seem to think it does because it relies on everyone doing the same thing(We know how this works out when it comes to democracy, arguably a more universally shared value than the suffering of animals, which unfortunately not everyone shares to the same extent). This argument, however, is very strong:\n\n&gt; Many vegans will put a lot of energy into maintaining a type of \"vegan purity\". This can be helpful as it reinforces their vegan identity and make them less likely to go back to eating animal products, but it can portray veganism as burdensome and inaccessible, and that ultimately harms animals.\n\nThis stuff not only creates division between potential allies, but it makes vegans look insane or unhinged, especially with the level of concern that can be imagined around someone ordering a Beyond Whopper at a place like Burger King, but asking the person to please clean the grill before they cook the vegan patty so no meat particles come in contact with it, because that would be akin to a deeply religious Jew or Muslim consuming a single cell of pork. \n\n**Edit**:\n\nTo really clarify this, when I encounter any kind of purity or emotional\/disgust based concern for animals, I immediately put myself in the position of the cow. Immediately. I become the cow, I try to stop being myself(or another version is I'm a human slave who is treated the same way as the [Fairlife calfs\/cows](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg). What would I think if live stream footage was shown to me, of a human being expressing this kind of thought? \"Ewwww, I got some icky human stuff in my pristine McPureGoodyums!\"(In the background, my mothers vocal chords are shot as she cries to me from meters away, while a more powerful being beats me repeatedly). I don't... think I care, at this point, what you're eating. I don't *even* think it matters to me if you give the middleman of the middleman of the middleman of the middleman that is in a financial relationship with the slavery and torture center some money. Will that really make it so less of my kind is tortured? Is it better than nothing? It could be the case, but even here, I don't even know. I'm being beaten right now. I'm panting because they won't give me water and it's 97 degrees out today. This is hell. Is there an economic solution here? I... don't... think so... There very well may *not* be. There's got to be a better way to do this than picking the Beyond Whopper over the regular Whopper, because that strategy either seems so inconsequential at the individual level given the immense disparity of human beings to concern themselves with what they put into their feeding hole, or of zero impact, or even of **negative** impact. This last one is **truly** the nightmare scenario for **e** **v** **e** **r** **y** **o** **n** **e**: Paradoxically *more* harm to animals, by spending lots of energy on the idea that plant based food is the solution to animal torture. The only worse hell than animal torture is one where the only people on the planet concerned enough about it form a kind of purity\/dietary religion and then moralize themselves\/others on this basis like egomaniacs instead while thinking their actions directly deal a blow to stopping animal torture when this is potentially far away from what actually happens. \n\nAnyway, that's why I think this question shouldn't be overlooked, and is incredibly important to get right. I say more about vegan intuitions in the next paragraph, but I had to add this edit to try harder to get the point across.\n\n&gt; Vegetarians spare approximately 30 farmed animals each year. How much would it cost to spare a similar amount of farmed animals through a donation to an effective animal charity?\n\nI think the core problem with veganism is this sort of calculus seems intuitive, but this is not how it plays out in reality. In many cases, meat economics are slow to adjust. I could easily see our world being the sort of world where a daily meat eater switches to 100% plants for a year, and makes zero actual impact when it comes to animal suffering. If we had to torture animals directly ourselves for meat, this wouldn't be true. I can even imagine a worse world: Where animal suffering goes **up** as a result of going vegan. This could occur if the resulting trends of veganism simply cause animal products to become less expensive, which means more poor\/poor-adjacent people(the vast majority of people on our planet), to consume more meat. Which brings me to the final problem I see:\n\nEmotions. If the above were true, how easy would it be to deliver this message to people who think there's a strong relationship between diet and animal suffering? If you've browsed around the veganism debate for long enough, you'll know it's impossible.\n\nAs a total tangent, and totally off topic(apologies), I just want to mention I believe Antinatalism suffers from similar problems as this, but the difference is that the human who abstains from bringing someone into existence is *directly* reducing human misery in the short term, so the argument is easier to make, but it can have the same kind of paradoxical effects as plant based diets = more meat eating, which should be a very high concern of ours right now. \n\nAs far as economic strategies, I'm most interested in truly collaborative attacks where we can make allies with meat eating people. This would involve engineering some kind of viral movement to target a single animal product industry, such as milk ,or eggs, or perhaps a non-commonly consumed animal in the English speaking world(this means not cows, or pigs, or chicken). Then we just agree to stop all consumption of this **one** product. If we could collaborate this way, we could feasibly deal a big blow to one industry. But this would be deeply difficult to get everyone' support in, and could take as much as several years to plan out. Looking at the logistics of this is also helpful because it allows us to rethink just how much suffering we actually reduce by trickling vegans in our fold.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622247607,"distinguished":null,"edited":1622320631.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gztjy62","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nms25e","locked":false,"name":"t1_gztjy62","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_nms25e","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/nms25e\/four_arguments_against_veganism_that_are_actually\/gztjy62\/","retrieved_utc":1627820061,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

If I were a hypothetically severely depressed person who *could* be cured, I would be okay with dying prematurely here if it meant a society where the least fortunate aren't tortured for my personal \"success story\" to be possible, because once you torture things, your \"success story\" is actually a \"failure story\" in the big picture.\n\nThat being said...\n\nI would strongly caution anyone trying to commit suicide.

Why evil, and suffering is probably the most obvious example, exists in the world created by an Omnibenevolent God. You can find some theodicy trying to \"justify\" the existence of a benevolent God. Relatively recently, dr. Stephen Law popularized the conception of a perfectly evil God, an entirely malevolent being. You could read about it here:  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Evil_God_Challenge\n\nAnd then from wikipedia:\n\n&gt; Several criticisms and responses to the Evil God Challenge have been presented. William Lane Craig, Steve Wykstra, Dan Howard-Snyder, and Mike Rea have all suggested that **the evident presence of good in the world makes impossible the notion of an all-evil, omnipotent God.**[11] \n\nI find this obviously untrue, personally. The presence of good does *not* make an evil god impossible, evil often comes with a charming smile. Evil kills good, then wears the flayed skin of good to hide its true nature-- this is a fundamental function of true evil. Good, cannot do this. To be good, you **must** be bound by rules. Rules like \"Don't frivolously torture things\", and so on. Good needs to obey the *full* suite of ethics, where as Evil only has a single win condition: Dominate everything. Evil when it's completely powerless, is not something that one can even call evil. It cannot act(powerless), it poses no threat(powerless), etc. Maximum evil is the total power to do **anything**, which is why an omnipotent God is much more likely synonymous with evil than good, since the way one achieves such a position of total power is by being the *thing* which is willing to use \"Every move\" in a game theoretical sense. It's like a kickboxing match for infinity, but one of the participants refuses to use kicks, because kicks here symbolize unethical moves. Obviously this participant will lose, and the one who trains their kicking(through selection pressure) will win \"Rank 1\".","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622251696,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gztqymk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nfsr2e","locked":false,"name":"t1_gztqymk","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_gyo6o39","permalink":"\/r\/promortalism\/comments\/nfsr2e\/what_do_you_think_about_the_evilgodhypothesis\/gztqymk\/","retrieved_utc":1627819732,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"promortalism","subreddit_id":"t5_3i342","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

I'm not a psychiatrist, but there's nothing about this arbitrary point in time that suggests \"2021\" is the magical year where things have been figured out. For instance, there's no reason to think that what we call \"ordered\" thinking is set in stone, or that the gavel has been slammed down on what is \"disordered\" thinking or personality.\n\nI find I relate a little bit to many things called \"Disorders\". Especially when I read various subreddits dedicated to some disorder, someone will say something like \"Does anyone else do *this*?\" \"Does anyone else struggle *here*?\" \"Does anyone else dislike *this* about the world?\"\n\nAnd it's always in the context of the disorder, but my answer is almost always the same: That's probably less of a \"Disorder\" problem, and more of a \"the world\" problem. This is a human problem. We're all sort of gaslit here, no matter \"what\" we are: we're in a world that tells us what ideals we should follow, but again, it's just so arbitrary. How would adhering to the status quo work 8,000 years ago, when humans were deeply ignorant with respect to just about anything relative to today? 6,000? 4? 2? 500, 400, 300, 200? At what \"point\" is this \"it\"? Will the year 3,000 make a total mockery of today? Odds seem pretty good if we're following along the patterns of history.\n\nI think a lot of these symptoms are simply too inconvenient for a deeply confused, and too often a deeply malicious world who cannot deal with this dark truth. There's a *reason* people are suspicious of others-- this is not a \"disorder\", this is because humans are simply a deeply cruel species if history(which is almost *certainly* sugarcoated rather than embellished to paint us in a poor light) is to tell us anything.\n\nTo answer the question at the very end of your post: I think all humans belong here, to one degree or another.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622259849,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gzu54iz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nnahto","locked":false,"name":"t1_gzu54iz","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_nnahto","permalink":"\/r\/Schizotypal\/comments\/nnahto\/so_here_i_am\/gzu54iz\/","retrieved_utc":1627819120,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizotypal","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlzo","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

And if I thought there were no free will, I would experience positive emotions like love, happiness and gratitude to a much lesser extent: if someone does something nice for me, it means nothing because they couldn't have NOT done it, and there's no point feeling grateful or seeing their actions as an expression of love. The thought of having no free will is just unbearably bleak to me.\n\nAh okay. This is common too. The first thing to point out is people conflate \"in control\" with \"**freely** in control\"-- this is a subtle semantic nuance that causes people a lot of anxiety. You're very right that having zero control is stressful for all sentient beings. If you chain a being up, constantly restrict its movement, or choices, and it will feel awful. But that's not the kind of lack of control we have, but it's *this* kind of imagery that fuels our aversion\/depression\/anxiety to the idea of no free will. Our lack of control is an ultimate one. You're in *control* of your eyes right now. You can demonstrate this by looking in any direction you want, once these words get transferred through your optic nerves and into your brain and you're reminded that you were rather lost in the endeavor of reading a reddit post and briefly *forgot* that you could fully scan the totality of your surroundings right this moment. Don't worry, I'll forget this too only seconds after I finish this paragraph, there's nothing wrong with you here.\n\nBut what you end up doing( even if you choose to completely ignore the options of looking away from reading this and never take your eyes off of the screen ), is not up to you, because a truly free choice is simply impossible in the context of causality. We're free to choose, but we're not free to choose **what** we choose.\n\nOn the subject of ethics, someone doing something nice in a deterministic world is still perfectly good. They still had to make a decision(although not freely). It still required some effort(but not freely). It still opens the door to someone who maybe, disliked you intensely before, but through an internal struggle to do the right thing, showed you kindness when everything inside them told them to be cruel to you instead. All of that is still possible.\n\nBut notice what's *impossible*: Blaming someone for things. Feeling hatred. Feeling a desire to get revenge. Wishing misfortune on someone pointlessly. Think of any flaw you believe you have right now, and there's likely someone out there who would *really* hold it against you, and in the right context maybe even attempt to ruin your life over it. They can only do this if they believe you *really* could have done otherwise. Live long enough and you'll experience some kind of deeply unfair judgement from someone, somewhere. It's crystal clear that this kind of attitude doesn't make any sense in our world, where people are simply thrown into genetic and environmental conditions, and the algorithm of causality is simply \"powered on\" without their consent.\n\nSo goodness is still perfectly compatible with no free will, but malice, once the firmware upgrade occurs, is incompatible(on an intellectual level). It makes *sense* to be good in a causal world, where as it *doesn't* make sense to be cruel in a causal world.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622403004,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h006rug","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nl6no1","locked":false,"name":"t1_h006rug","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h004dh6","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/nl6no1\/i_wish_i_could_take_all_my_childs_pain_away\/h006rug\/","retrieved_utc":1627809857,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Do I think we have free will? No, and I even hold the position that it's the single most morally damaging idea humans have invented(the idea is a kind of weapon used by powerful people to pretend a deeply unfair and unjust world is fair; Lions invent and spread the meme of free will, the herbivores they prey on, don't.)-- but the solution to the problem isn't going to be more philosophical discussions. It's going to be closer to something like Jonathan Haidt's stuff on what kinds of people subscribe to what kinds of political beliefs. \n\nIf who you are is a good indicator of what you believe politically, then who you are should also be a good indicator of what you believe philosophically. Prove people who believe in free will didn't have a choice to(and those who don't, etc), then you have a stronger argument than a thousand more years of debate on this subject. Psychology is pretty awesome at showing us that humans are pretty laughably bad at knowing why they do the things they do.\n\nThe reason why debate gets us nowhere may not be clear: We're all experiencing something different, and this experience is then modulated by dramatically different traits, and different values. We're essentially all in our own unique version of \"The Matrix\". On top of this, we play these extremely complex semantic games where one person says \"free\" and means \"definition a\" , while another person says \"free\" and means \"definition b\", while the former person conflates choice and free choice, and the other person completely distinguishes choices and free choices.\n\n None of these conversation rules get hashed out, so we're just speaking gibberish on the subject any time two sides go at it(Semantics are the *easiest* of these problems to solve yet we still fail miserably). All of these reasons  are why you probably aren't going to converge on reality if you just talk things through.

Take vampires, for example. Basically parasitic\/predatory psychopaths, but utterly sexualized and romanticized in our popular culture. In most cases, evil is represented in a cartoonish or bumbling way. Christian Bale's character in American Psychopath is just this over the top, satirical example of callous, homicidal, narcissism and egomania to the point that it paradoxically fails to represent how basic and human a real psychopath appears. If you want to represent an S-tier psychopath, you represent a truly benign seeming individual with a charming smile, with no outward defects, but an intense inner maliciousness and sadomasochism that is only revealed when its too late. **That's** evil.\n\nBut what we do in our media, and this isn't an accident-- from books, to TVshows, films, our mythology\/religious iconography, we paint evil as this often dark, overtly malicious thing. With horns, or sharp teeth, or red eyes, or black armor, or a red sword to symbolize how clearly evil they are-- and worse of all, in all of our stories and myths, evil loses at the end. Almost always. How strange is that?

DNA \"created\" in every one of us the ability to experience great anguish and pain if we are confronted with anything that could potentially end its existence (predators, lethal injuries and intoxication, the suffering of a loved one, the desire for suicide...), and yet, a philosophy such as AN and efilism rose from the cradle, and some people, very few people, basically a handul of 'em, were able to face the ultimate truth, and integrate these \"anti-DNA\" memes inside their mind, a construct of their DNA. \n\nThis is how it works more or less, but it shouldn't be forgotten that \"Anti-DNA\" memes are ultimately an attempt at a \"Pro-DNA\" strategy. DNA isn't planning anything, it just tries **everything**(if it is given enough chances), then the environment sorts it all out in a massive algorithm based on the narrow values of what is adapted\/replicable. If something we see as \"Anti-DNA\" is adapted\/replicable(no matter how **nonsensical** it may look to us), the it is really \"Pro-DNA\".\n\n&gt; it is simply one of many types of molecules that replicate themselves for purely physical reasons. Eventually, once the code became more complex with more strings, it became more susceptible to more changes (mutations), and some of these changes created the property of adaptation\n\nTo understand how adaptation fits into things, it could be helpful to think of it in non-organic terms too. A rock is adapted to its environment in so far as it exists, in a sense. If it dissolves into sand, then it's not adapted to be a rock, right? If it's composed of a substance that resists being weathered by rain and water and wind and particulate matter, and remains a rock, then it is adapted to be a rock. DNA and the things running on DNA work the same way, except they then pass this adaptation \"recipe\"(like a cooking recipe) to be repeated, with small( or large) mistakes being made when it's repeated, which then rolls the \"is it adapted?\" dice over and over.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622491236,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h046t79","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_noodzg","locked":false,"name":"t1_h046t79","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_noodzg","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/noodzg\/from_an_evolutionary_standpoint_efilism_is_so\/h046t79\/","retrieved_utc":1627803780,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}
