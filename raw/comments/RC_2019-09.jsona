To this end, the AI might produce computronium (matter organized in a configuration that is optimal for computation) and use it to implement digital minds in states of euphoria. In order to maximize efficiency, the AI omits from the implementation any mental faculties that are not essential for the experience of pleasure, and exploits any computational shortcuts that according to its definition of pleasure do not vitiate the generation of pleasure. For instance, the AI might confine its simulation to reward circuitry, eliding faculties such as a memory, sensory perception, executive function, and language; it might simulate minds at a relatively coarse-grained level of functionality, omitting lower-level neuronal processes; it might replace commonly repeated computations with calls to a lookup table; or it might put in place some arrangement whereby multiple minds would share most parts of their underlying computational machinery (their \u201csupervenience bases\u201d in philosophical parlance). Such tricks could greatly increase the quantity of pleasure producible with a given amount of resources.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Nick Bostrom, Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies\n\nLet's make it so superintelligent AI determine what the most meaningful(not mindlessly hedonistic, but meaningfully blissful) experiences are for everyone, and made it so the laws of physics were maximally exploited to reach this state. For everything alive, things would be going not just beyond excellent, but continually getting better, and better, and better-- to a degree that no one alive has ever experienced before.\n\nThere are *still* antinatalist arguments in such a scenario. What prevents an even more superintelligent-capable malevolent alien race from effortlessly hijacking this entire enterprise and turning it into Torture Galaxy 8,000(tm)? Is this coming tomorrow? You simply can't know. The risk of continuing existence is ever present. This is why non-existence is superior to *any* utopia. And that's just for a utopia, the very real hell that exists on earth today is just a little bit far away from a utopia.\n\n Not just that, but such a utopia is impossible in practice in a universe where psychopathy and domination are the number 1, de facto winner strategies for elite beings. This is true both on Earth(psychopaths dominate the apex of human hierarchy on Earth, always have, always will), and it should be true for the entire universe since natural selection + entropy favors this strategy over others. There is no better method for ruling over the universe than perfecting psychopathy. Whatever you come up with to counter this fact, your imagined strategy *plus* psychopathic traits(domination,callousness,self-absorption, manipulation, deception, charm) should beat it. Given that we are on the cusp of developing superintelligent AI sometime this century barring a global catastrophic event, this is bad news for all local life, whatever 'local' will mean in that context.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567296379,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eypcqwr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cy1gvp","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_cy1gvp","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/cy1gvp\/antinatalism_in_utopia\/eypcqwr\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575902429,"score":5,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I consider just about every human alive today to be this sort of psychopath, but the best ones will naturally be selected to win and rule the world. When I imagine someone reading this and doubting it, I imagine two things going on in their heads. 1) They are the victims of propaganda in the form of media like movies, the news, even ancient mythology-- which is all largely spread by and created by these sorts of higher-order psychopaths. Stories are ancient, and they almost always have a protagonist\/antagonist framing, and good almost always wins in the end. This should be highly suspicious in a reality like ours, but everyone takes this for granted and assumes human beings are mostly harmless. Humans are not harmless. They are murderous, selfish, ultra-deceptive liars. If trapped on an island with you and no food, you would quickly learn what millions of years of ape evolution resulted in. The 2nd) are these last features; charm, deception, manipulation. This is what makes people seem normal and friendly. This is what makes people tell themselves, \"But *I'm* not that bad of a person, and most people aren't!\" Everyone hides the monster that evolved daily, but if you pay close attention, you will see the illusion break from time to time both in yourself and others, if you just spend enough time paying attention and if the conditions of life become stressed enough.\n\n&gt;are those psycopaths the \"ligottian\" conspirators?\n\nNot sure.\n\n&gt;exploiting the human society as a renewable energy to support their luxury bloodlines, and thus being the only ones having a financial interest in keeping society overall healthy and alive, denying death and suffering and so creating the prolife delusions?\n\nExploitation of society as renewable energy beings to scratch the surface here. The title of Jared Diamond's book Guns, Germs, and Steel begins to lay out why the world was won by its current winners, but it's more than that. Guns broadly represent military technology, but can more broadly represent all technology. This is still just as true today as it was in the last 5,000 years of history. If your military+tech stat is higher than everyone else, you've secured one deterministic piece of winning the world. Who would play such a game? People who live for war games. People who are only risk averse when it means not winning. Every other risky move generates no anxiety and no stress, no fear, no guilt. Let a city of yours get nuked in order to \"retaliate\" to win the world? A perfectly viable move for a 'winner'. Only someone who will ask, \"Is this truly the ethical way forward? Is this world a sane world?\" will lose the game when it's 1 vs. 1 with the nukes button. Psychopaths have the advantage, psychopaths have the evolutionary adaptations, psychopaths win the world. You exist as a potential solder or scientist or engineer which can benefit the winners in technological and military strenth-- you are a pawn to the winners.\n\nGerms are very interesting, because all societies essentially want to turn their societies into supergerm and superfungus breeding grounds. They want their members of society to be both hyperexposed to germs today, and hyper-stressed by germs. At the same time, world-engineers flood society with antibacterial\/antifungal prescription medications. This simultaneously selects people with weak immune systems(essentially soft-eugenics) but also selects the bacteria by killing 99.99% of it, breeding superbacteria. The society which can engineer the most powerful germs still benefits today, and plenty of research is done in this direction. To the winners of the world, you are a bacteria farm which is either meant to die and be selected out from the genetic pool, or your duty is to breed the new super pathogen which can potentially be weaponized, or your immune system is so hearty that it too can be weaponized for defensive measures. This is a side-benefit to the massive 100billion+ animals killed yearly on factory farms. The last 5,000 years the societies which could get resistance to the nastiest germs due to raising livestock could use these germs to kill anyone in foreign encounters, and this is still true today. All cows, chickens, pig, sheep, etc are bacteria farms today, waiting to be weaponized. You too are a small farm and science lab to the winners of this world.\n\nSteel just means resources and you can probably lump economy here. If you can win the war for the parts to build the most microprocessors and control the world's technology, you win. If you can develop the new cutting edge technology, you win. If you control the oil supply, you have a massive edge. Everything is balanced around the war for natural resources. This is why military strength is so important-- it lets you control the resources by force. Oil is tricky, because there's sort of a strangle-hold on it, and everyone needs it to play the racing game. This is one potential reason why 'climate change' is the issue of the times. By intentionally heating the Earth, you force adaptation to solving the energy problem(nuclear energy is too easily sabotaged and with disastrous effects-- the country to go exclusively nuclear loses to a single elite hacker\/covert operation). You also 'smoke out' the places on Earth that are already the hottest-- those which control the oil. The last major American wars were wars of resources. Everyone knows Iraq was a war for oil to some degree. Afghanistan in 2017 was estimated at 3trillion of natural resources, but I'm sure it's much more than that. It's also famous for poppy fields, which are used to manufacture heroin. The quote from Frank Herbert's Dune is apt here: \"He who controls the spice, controls the universe.\" Notice how much more complicated all of this is than the simpleton narrative of: \"Human stupid. Mess up own planet. We need stop stupid messing up own planet!\" That's the world. Immensely complex war games by a small elite few, and many billion mindless \"worker drones\" who are fed propaganda that is easy to digest, and are farmed and exploited in numerous ways-- just waiting to be sacrificed for the goal of winning the game.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567346466,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eyqkzda","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cy1gvp","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eyq7qlm","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/cy1gvp\/antinatalism_in_utopia\/eyqkzda\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575923427,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

The problem there is, it's sort of like diagnosing narcissistic personality disorder or psychopathy.

It doesn't favor ethics or truth, though. This is because natural selection, a game with no rules, a game with no policeman in the sky saying \"Better behave or else you won't win this game\", is a game where there is only one rule: Win in any way you can.\n\nWhen *this* is the rule, the game becomes \"exploit the prisoner's dilemma as skillfully as possible\". There are no ethics, only \"how to avoid ethics whenever they hinder winning\". There is no ultimate goal of truth, either, only \"which truths(and which lies) assist in winning.\"\n\nThis is clear when you examine some artifacts of natural selection, like self-deception-- the phenomenon of lying to *yourself*.  How could this be an adaptation? It's obvious how being a liar could favor you getting ahead in life, but how could it benefit you to lie to *yourself*? Wouldn't that be bad? The answer is, by convincing yourself of certain lies, you can tell the best possible lies. This will also become useful with a second artifact: Psychosis.\n\nPsychosis is simply being delusional. Surely, being delusional is a bad thing, right? Why would we *want* to be delusional? Well, nature is crazy that way, because some delusions are strategically advantageous when the world you live in *is* crazy. Hundreds of thousands of years ago, if you saw\/heard a rustle in the grass, and it was a predator, but you were skeptical and said \"Maybe it isn't predator\", you died. If you assumed it was a predator in **every** case, you lived. This is how paranoia turns into a superpower. It doesn't matter if you look crazy every time the grass rustles and it's just the wind, it just matters that you **live** long enough to **reproduce**. That's all your genes care about. Thus, even believing that the grass rustling is because of an evil god of the grasses, is a beneficial belief to you, even if it is completely delusional.\n\nNow, if someone presents you with strong arguments for why the evil god of grasses is imaginary, you can even use the aforementioned self-deception to form a new kind of insanity-- cognitive dissonance. This is when you hold two contradictory ideas simultaneously. You know it's a lie, but you also fully believe in it. Again, 'winning' in nature is not about making sense. It's **only** about winning, which only means stewarding the genes onward.\n\nIf being batshit insane stewards the genes onward, that's what wins. If being a manipulative selfish asshole who pretends they're nice stewards the genes onward, that's what wins. If beating your children and telling them they're trash on a daily basis stewards their genes onward, that's what wins. It's not about what makes sense. It's not about what is ethical or moral. It's not about perfectly seeking the truth.\n\nIt's **just**. **what**. **wins**.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567435989,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eytgjp1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cykz9x","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_cykz9x","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/cykz9x\/in_order_to_survive_and_reproduce_successfully_an\/eytgjp1\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575973147,"score":12,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I don't care if I'm harmed, or say, I lose my job, or my marriage fails, because I broke out of some delusion.

Many people are wired for a deep aversion towards loneliness, and that I *do* understand, but I think the problem can be resolved through knowledge alone. Simply accepting that people can only have bad and dishonest motives is a strong foundation for embracing solitude. I've set boundaries with all of the people I once thought were my friends, but taught me that human beings aren't good company, ultimately. It's only through the sort of self-hypnosis many people are fond of that we see people as worthwhile of having relationships with-- it makes us feel good, but it isn't *good*. Once you examine your own psychology in a truly honest way, and examine the behaviors and motives of those you know in a truly honest way, you will not want their company, and you will not want anyone to have your company either. \n\n&gt; i need to lose all hope of finding fulfilling relationships, and accept being deeply lonely, constantly. \n\nIt depends on what you value, and what words like 'fulfilling' mean to you. If I said I had a drug that would make you experience permanent happiness with no negative side-effects, just the perfect happiness drug, so perfect that you only had to take a single pill and the effect would be permanent and irreversible, would you take it? Notice the price you pay for not being in touch with reality here if you take the pill. Say you have a child, and that child suffers a horrible accident, and is disfigured. You could only feel happiness here. It's important to me, therefore, that our emotions scale with reality and represent reality. If reality is deeply negative, this is something I want to know. If relationships are not fulfilling, this is something I want to know. I don't want to be in a fake friendship or relationship only to discover the person I'm involved with doesn't actually give a shit and would leave me dead in a gutter when their self-interest took precedence. \n\nFor me, the single most important thing is being in touch reality, even if reality is deeply negative and makes me unhappy. I would rather be unhappy and right, than happy and wrong. This is why our language represents this aspect of what is true-- we say \"The bitter truth\" for a reason, notice there is no 'sweet truth' or 'happy truth'? Just dark truth, bitter truth, etc. This is because truth is often psychologically destabilizing. Ignorance is seen as blissful by many. We are allergic to what is negative, therefore we are allergic to truth.\n\nThe universe we exist in is not a happy place, nor a good place. It's a place where children are constantly raped(one is raped as I write this post, another one is raped as you read this post, etc.). (NSFL, but I encourage you watch it if you value reality rather than delusion)Animals are constantly [eaten alive](https:\/\/youtu.be\/95c5GTp__AU) and [tortured](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3315) in hells, many of which *we* engineered. Human beings are tortured in mindless jobs, or abused by parents who are indifferent to their suffering. Why do we do this? Because we don't understand what right and wrong are? Not exactly, no... we've had thousands of years to understand very basic concepts about right and wrong. It's not that complicated. The problem is, **human beings** are 1) evil and 2) delusional. The second one obfuscates the first one, and protects our false sense of sanity. What caused this to be the case, that in 2019, all hairless monkeys of the species we call 'homo sapiens' are evil and delusional to various degrees?\n\nNatural selection caused it. Natural selection simply favors the bad guys and the delusional guys. There's no rule in nature that says \"Elephants are nice animals that eat plants, lions are evil things that eat meat, so we will correct for this by awarding elephants special benefits, but lions will get punished for bad behavior\". It simply rewards the winner. There's no rule in nature that says \"who ever figures out reality, gets rewarded\". To the contrary, delusions served to prop up our ancestors where skeptics and deeply intelligent apes were killed, killed themselves, or withered away. It benefits the monkey to believe the grass rustling is a predator in all cases, or the monkey who believes in the evil grass god. It doesn't benefit the monkey to be correct or investigate the truth about the grass rustle in the event it was the wind-- that monkey gets killed and doesn't reproduce. Natural selection *favors* delusions, because the only rule is \"Win\". \n\nHumanity exists under the same exact rules, and our world reflects this today, but only upon close examination. There are countless lies in place to make this not obvious. The biggest lie is the stories we are indoctrinated with as children and indulge in as adults. These stories, fantasies, help us cope with the harsh nature of reality-- abusive parents, distant 'friends', careless teachers, a world of strangers who don't seem totally 'there'. These stories tell us there is good and evil, and there may be a hard fought battle, but the good guys win in the end. This story is ubiquitous, and a very ancient lie, and it's true it may have some accidentally pro-social benefits because it lets any 'good guy' in real life fight onward, stay stoic, keep their chin up, and even against all odds, continue fighting for the sake of goodness, a sort of 'fake it till you make it' strategic benefit. At first glance this seems to us to be so noble and obviously good, but this isn't the case when we ask who these stories *truly* benefit. Take a second to notice how strange Game of Thrones would be if [[spoiler]](\/s\"the night king won, turned everything into zombies, and the credits rolled\")?\n\n\n...Yet there is another winner of these stories. An ultimate winner. The ultimate winner of the ancient myth that good wins, is evil. If everyone is taught and believes that good wins, these are the precise conditions for evil to dominate reality, since evil masquerades as good, and this 'false good' appears to be constantly winning. And that is what I predict is operational in our world today. Two aspects of science support this prediction, the first is natural selection. In nature, evil *should* win naturally, simply because evil is just as strong as good *minus* being bound by rules. A technologically advanced benevolent species simply doesn't stand a chance against an equally advanced malevolent species. Here fantasy, myth, and story serve to confuse us about what good and evil are. Evil is not some caricature, some black cape-wearing, Darth Vader-esque, or Night King-esque horrible thing. Evil is beautiful. Evil is charming. Evil pretends to be irresistibly good-- until the moment where it is time to **win**. This is when evil transforms and shows its face and takes off its mask. This is why psychopathy is the de facto standard for evil. Ted Bundy wore his arm in a sling to appear more vulnerable, then bludgeoned women to be raped and murdered-- the Night King would be inclined to take notes, but even Bundy is a failed representation of true evil because he was caught doing relatively 'petty' crimes. The truly evil beings of Earth are untouchable by the law and make a mockery of Bundy's evil. The old Christian depictions of Lucifer are not some grotesque demonic looking thing, but rather as a beautiful, charming, captivating figure with terrible malevolent power. Who benefits from the stereotypical caricatures of evil which are prevalent in all cultures? Apex psychopathy; the distillation of evil that exists on planet earth today, and the thing which owns reality, and determines who lives and dies.\n\nThe second aspect of science that ensures that evil not only gains a lead, but **stays** in the lead, is the second law of thermodynamics-- entropy. Entropy just means \"things break down the farther one is in spacetime\". Once evil is in power, you simply cannot overtake it, even if you are the ultimate goodness and have equivalent power to evil somehow, simply because it's so much easier to break things than to fix them. Evil just sits in its lofty treehouse, and you must now build a ladder to meet it eye to eye. So you work and work and build this ladder, but evil can just effortlessly set fire to it. In the mean time, it only cements its iron grip over reality, plan with all of its accrued wealth and power to move from a tree house to a stone fortress, efficiently making winning moves, etc, while *your* workload has only multiplied. You must now build another ladder, fireproof your ladder, treat your injuries, and so on. Evil gets to just sit and watch and formulate a plan on how to ruin you again, and again, and again. This is the unfortunate truth of the universe-- we live in a universe where evil not only has an advantage in winning, but it's the **only** possible outcome the conditions of physics and biology allow for. If this was the truth, how many people would be prepared to accept it or honestly entertain it?","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567452500,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eyu43bk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_blmquu","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eytvs9l","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/blmquu\/can_everyone_please_tell_me_how_they_deal_with\/eyu43bk\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575984333,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

We dislike and bully things we perceive as 'robotic', which autistic people tend to be. I think this could be partly because the phenomenology of autism lacks the schizophrenia gradient. Autism is almost like... mathematical? Just facts, no connections other than other logical facts. Poor 'big picture' ability, poor 'pattern based' ability. Where as schizophrenia is deep, often false connections, creating this rich(too rich), information palette-- to the point of hallucinations and delusions. Patterns **everywhere**. If you have a little bit of both, you seem human. But if you have an excess of one or the other, the pure order of autism, or the pure chaos of schizophrenia, you will be socially outcast either for being a robot or insane.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567453764,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eyu5vrw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cyr55n","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_cyr55n","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/cyr55n\/autistic_self_centered_thinking_is_supposed_to\/eyu5vrw\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575985181,"score":4,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

It can be found in this quote:\n\n&gt;These \"very specific things!\" are, for lots of people, things like \"just function day to day, take care of and guide my children towards the future, without having a completely accurate worldmap.\"\n\nOne of those things is absolutely critical for rationality, and the other two aren't, not in the sense that most well off, first-world country enjoying people think of them as. I'm sure you can figure out which one is *truly* critical to rationality. If you understand why I only value this truly critical component, and dismiss anyone who assumes the others, you will understand my contention here with total clarity.\n\n&gt; Are you certain that you value this above, say, just a baseline level of functionality as an adult?\n\nI'm certain. I would rather know the truth and be homeless as a result of *discovering* this truth. This doesn't mean I would trade, say, knowing what you're thinking right now, for homelessness. This isn't just a blind barter for truth where *any* truth is valuable, even knowledge that I may think is pointless. I'm talking about meaningful truth. So, say, if I learn that my landlord is operating a child rape ring, and my only options are homelessness or to live here and pay him rent, because life is just that rough where the only apartment I could possible find is this one, then I *prefer* to be homeless and not pay him rent. There are people who are more prone to hedonism or self-absorption that they will admit, \"I'd just rather *not* know such things.\" I am not one of these people. It's important to notice how this is at odds with \"a baseline level of functionality as an adult\".\n\nIf the ultimate truth of reality results in me taking a gun and blowing my brains out because spending any more time existing is an affront to seriously interpreting said truth(here I just mean, I can wait for a month and plan a more clean and trauma-free suicide), **that** is exactly what I want to know, as soon as possible. Notice, again, how being rational here is opposed with the values you pre-suppose, which I dismiss, by *only* being committed to truth and rationality.\n\n&gt;If so, why do you believe in reality? Can you give evidence that there is an objective universe outside of your head, which is governed by unchanging rules?\n\nWhy am I not a solipsist? The same reason just about everyone rejects solipsism, because you hit bedrock fairly quickly when you seriously entertain it. I am concerned with truth, and you don't get very far here being a solipsist. I could see someone who values their own hedonism also reject solipsism, or values waking up tomorrow, but these are not things that I value *if* the truth doesn't point me in that direction. If the truth says, again, kill yourself immediately, I don't have some value that goes \"oh but... I *really* do need to wake up tomorrow, so... let's skip on *this* colossal, profound truth that implies immediately death is the correct response\". This is just one of those things I think is completely rational but doesn't appear so in a highly irrational world. Being a hairless egomaniacal monkey at a position in spacetime where hairless monkeys are in their intellectual infancy, means to be entangled with much irrationality, unfortunately. You can say, \"But shouldn't I value waking up tomorrow *to* discover the truth?\" Yes, you should, but this is usually the response of hedonic egomaniacs rather than the commitment of those who are slaves to truth and rationality alone. Almost no one is prepared to blow their brains out when the truth points in that direction, but almost everyone is salivating at the idea of waking up tomorrow to keep the mouse wheel spinning. It is not a philosophically interesting or intellectually honest proposition to simply say \"We need to wake up tomorrow to discover the truth.\" It *is* interesting and intellectually honest to say \"I am so committed to the truth that I would discard everything else I value-- nation, religion, politics, family, fortune, happiness, etc.\"\n\n&gt;This is 100% the key point of the article. Do you think that you don't have limited computational resources? It isn't just some goofy phrase i'm using; it's a key premise of the blog. People are computers with limited computational ability. If we could think about all hypotheses simultaneously, with no cost, then the argument falls apart.\n\nIt seems to make sense, if you completely ignore what it means to be meaningfully rational. If being meaningfully rational means to you, \"Be irrational just to survive another day\", then I really hate to break it to you but that is **not** rational. Rationality is not *so* plastic as to be *anything* that gets you from point A to B, no matter how much irrational baggage you have. This is not rationality. \"I want to, I *need* to, become the Pope one day.\" There is no context here for the rational roadmap to becoming the Pope. We're no longer dealing with rationality, barring some extremely dishonest gymnastics(ie, I'm some sort of secret agent and my mission involves becoming the Pope to save the world from the Vatican which turns out to be evil, or some other arguably rational context).","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567468889,"distinguished":null,"edited":1567470741,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eyupve2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cyhac8","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eyuddbq","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/cyhac8\/faith_as_rational_technique\/eyupve2\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575994841,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

So... how can I even choose what I will do? God chose it for me, right?\"\n\nThus, the lie for free will was invented. This lie still exists today.

The most aggressive self-preserving ideas win here-- not the best ones. Not the most ethical ones. In fact, \"Evil\" ideas are predisposed to win over \"Good\" ideas, in purely moral terms(in the same way lions are predisposed to win against a slow moving herbivore-- it doesn't matter if you're a benign creature that doesn't torture other animals, it matters if you have quick reflexes and sharp claws\/teeth-- fitness wins, not ethics).

It accepts the meme of antinatalism, knowing that only the people who recognize life is bad(either people who had terrible lives themselves, or people who are honest enough to criticize this whole project, thereby being liabilities to the unity of the nation), will adopt the meme of antinatalism. These are both people that in ancient times, would be killed outright, allowed to die, or tortured as enemies of the in-group. But today, this fictional country can just rely on the meme of antinatalism to perform a kind of 'eugenic trick' on these people, thinning its population from problem citizens, strengthening natalists and those who cannot comprehend the unethical nature of what goes on in this nation(Loyal peons and brood peasants), strengthening the colony.\n\nIn the event that antinatalism is the most ethical possible move, this is a non-zero sum outcome because the nation wins via its eugenics, and the antinatalist wins via their ethical stance.

As fucking selfish as that mindset is.\n\nThis is something you should strongly avoid letting yourself ever do. Never, ever, ever, impulsively try to end your life. I'm not someone who is going to moralize you and tell you that you must live at all costs. I don't think suicide is selfish, and I won't tell you platitudes about how 'it gets better' or tell you to 'call this number', because there are plenty of people out there who have no idea what the depth of suffering is, are deeply uncomfortable with death, and will signal their discomfort and shallow concern, making you feel even more alone in their efforts to make themselves feel better. I will however, tell you that if you engage in *this* sort of behavior, the odds are overwhelmingly high that you will make things worse for yourself, not better.\n\nI can't know how bad your life is, but if you want to get to a position where you will actually be making the correct decisions going forward(however you wish to interpret that), you have to be in a clear mental state, right? This doesn't mean free from suffering, but you have to be free from things which prevent you from getting to the best answers, for the best reasons. Anything that doesn't involve looking at the facts of your situation clearly, is going to harm your ability to make the best possible decision going forward. This is something that sounds *so obvious* it doesn't even need to be said, but it's often these exact things that **do** need to be said. These obvious things are what we lose sight of so easily, because we're so absorbed in torrents of thoughts and emotions that we can't really process what is going on around us and inside our heads.\n\nMy prescription is always the same, and that's exercise. Both physical and mental. if you feel sharp physically and mentally, if you're totally free from emotions, baggage, dwelling on things you should have done, others should have done, etc, and you *still* want to die, that says something very important. But if you just want to die when you're in the opposite state, tormented daily by anxiety and depression and guilt and\/or resentment and whatever else is operating, that, we can agree, is a poor state to be making important decisions in, right? So it can't possibly hurt to just try to exercise the tiniest bit every day. A little bit physical, a little bit mental. If you have to choose, choose the mental: Mindfulness meditation: As simple as finding a seat, closing your eyes, taking some deep breaths, and just sitting and breathing naturally for as little as 5-10 minutes, while *watching* the breath. If you see yourself thinking, try to not react to the thoughts, just *notice* the thought as something that \"pops\" up, and return to watching your breath. It'll be hard to do, but! You will get better, the more you do it. All this is, is just training attention-- something extremely crucial when trying to make sense of life, right? It's hard to really emphasize how important this is, because it just doesn't sound that great on paper, but when you really put an effort here, you *will* notice some extremely desirable changes. Just 5-10 minutes every day for a few weeks are worth it for something which potentially transforms everything, right?","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567633387,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ez09cqx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_czqpgb","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_czqpgb","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/czqpgb\/i_23f_want_to_try_to_kill_myself_again\/ez09cqx\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576090532,"score":7,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Free will being false makes a complete joke out of the way society is structured. The way people are punished for things that would be completely outside of their control, or any *strongly* meritocratic idea is nonsensical and unethical and leads to human misery. Meritocracy and free will are the cornerstones of Libertarianism, therefore I think Libertarians, unless they're just naive victims of free will and need a quick primer, are all narcissists\/psychopaths\/egomaniacs. To reject free will for such a person is basically to suffer partial ego-death, because the phenomenology of narcissism and egomania is less coherent if you're fully aware that life is unfair and you didn't *earn* anything good about your life any more than someone who is unfortunate earned their misfortune.

We're territorial, constantly competing for space-- space in the real life conversation, space in the group chat, physical space, etc, we're constantly jealous, resentful, aggressive(passive aggressive!), needy in various ways, we're capricious, we look at certain people as enemies, but even sometimes those we call our friends, and when we're not being total psychopaths, we're think *at* ourselves in such absurd ways, like:\n\n\"Oh okay good there's food in the fridge, I swear, if I had to go out a *second* time today...\"\n\nit's like... you can *see* the food. You don't have to tell yourself there's food, your visual field *already* reveals it.\n\nJust think about *how* insane we'd sound if every single thought in our heads was secretly broadcast to everyone around us, through speakers we couldn't hear? We'd be exposed for psychopaths and maniacs. But we struggle to break out of that mode of thinking, so we get the sort of anxiety, jealousy, loneliness, and so on that you describe in your post, and it's often traumatic. But it doesn't need to be. All you need to do to soften the blow of this is first acknowledge how insane the brain \"sounds\", and try to detach from all of that crazy, and second, to understand that **everyone else** is *just* as crazy. There's really not a lot you're missing with these friends, I assure you. Even if these are somehow the *best* people on the planet now, for whatever reason, they *just* can't be bothered to include you, so... why devote so much mental energy to worrying about them? It's true that you can meet up with people and experience something that seems meaningful to both of you, but I find this to be *incredibly* rare, while at the same time, being projected at you as a fictional story by society and movies and books and social media, that says: \"**Everyone** should be having a great time, at all times.\" It's simply untrue. People are nuts. I'm nuts. You're nuts.

If there are differences in ability, there will be differences in power. And that power will be expressed, through some form of class. If capitalism disappears tomorrow, you will still be someone's slave, one way or another. The problem is deep inside humanity, not in a socioeconomic system. Framing the problem in socioeconomic terms, means that we pretend like the solution is changing the socioeconomic model.\n\nI hate all of the small scale expressions of what people refer to as \"due to capitalism\". I would *bet* that I hate them even more than the average Marxist, but I can't prove that of course.\n\n* I hate going to the grocery store and seeing an orange that is genetically engineered to the point of being flavorless, have a giant pith, never rot because it's been so heavily sprayed with chemicals, probably even marked \"organic\" so they can charge 2 times the price and spray it up to 11 times harder with organic toxic chemicals because dumb fucks think that's *better* that naughty evil synthetic chemicals since we can't help but appeal to nature, as if nature is \"good\". The produce doesn't even rot. It just sits there and shrivels. It can't even grow mold. It can't get sweeter. The farmer doesn't give a fuck, and the wholesaler doesn't give a fuck, because all that matters to them is getting the customer's dollar. They don't have incentives to make good food, it's *just* about maximizing profits.\n\n* I hate having to buy things, and have them break due to being made with junk parts and bad engineering, because planned obsolescence is a viable capitalist strategy, since they know that you can just flood the market with useless garbage, you can pay people to give 5 star product reviews, you can create a first generation product that is excellent and do a 180 and make the product sheer trash after a year, increase the price from the success of the first model, and then no one will be the wiser in the ensuing chaos of the system.\n\n* I hate being poor. I've been poor all of my life. Inequality is extremely... not fun. Life would be *objectively* better if we moved to a system that created social safety nets, and made life less shit for the bottom rungs of society. This isn't what I'm disputing with the modern \"Capitalism is **the** problem zeitgeist\".\n\nWhat I am disputing is, none of these features above, are actually features of capitalism. All of them, in fact, are features of humanity. Humans are domination and exploitation machines, and this has been our behavior well before capitalism existed. Animals, are domination machines. Fungi are domination machines. Bacteria are domination machines. Everything running on DNA is an out of control cancerous robot. We know this, because we know that genes are the expression of who we are, and these genes are shaped by the environment-- which includes other gene carries. Marxist ideology completely rejects modern genetics, so it's simply confused. There's nothing else to say. If you pretend the answer is *just* nurture, you will come up with fantasy based socioeconomic policies. Human beings, as they manifest today, are utterly fucking evil because they carry genes that maximize human domination and survival in an insane world, which makes us: 1) psychopaths and 2) psychotics. \n\nYou can discover this by realizing just how completely selfish you are on a day to day basis. If you get shown a video of something horrible happening to someone, it would be miraculous if it triggered in you enough empathy to actually *do* something about it. Just imagine that. Just imagine you seeing something and saying \"okay, enough is enough. I'm *solving* this injustice.\" Clearly that doesn't happen. If you're like most people, you're completely fucking dead inside, and if you're an outlier, you feel bad, you tell yourself \"Wow, so sad, so tragic\" and then you move on and watch some fucking cartoons or look at twitter\/reddit\/youtube. You just *don't* care as much as you think you do.\n\nWhen it comes to *you*, however, you care a lot! We're all complete egomaniac infants, [like this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HN1ru6_u8lY). And we fabricate very fancy stories about ourselves, that we're unique special people and the rest of the world is bad and we know how to fix it. Sorry, but that's a childish fantasy. You are infact an asshole. And I am too. And that's the case because we've been evolving in a game that actually **rewarded** the psychopathic and psychotic monkey that took a rock over the other monkey's head when no one else was looking, stole its food, and returned to the tribe and said \"Yeah, Grok died, totally tragic, by the way. Sup, Grok's wife? Mourning? Yeah, yeah, no, you're right. I'm free later this evening by the way if you want to stop by the tree. I'll take care of you from here.\"\n\nThat's not far from what has been happening for the last **several hundred thousand years**(Just to help you frame the scope, you've been alive for a couple decades **at most**, and we can barely make sense of the history of the last one to two thousand years. **One to two** thousands, as opposed to **hundreds of thousands**. ).

Any optimism is more likely to be co-opted by psychopathy. It's a kind of \"helpful meme\", but it ultimately benefits the bad guy for you to believe the whole idea of potential for good, progress, the neat trick of altruism, etc. It's the foundation of the human fictional story. The ancient story, from the most ancient ones we have, like Sumerian myths, to modern ones like superhero movies or Star Wars or whatever your favorite brand of protagonist\/antagonist narrative is.\n\nThe good guy, wins. The bad guy, even though they may be super powerful, and there is a great struggle, where good seems to be down for the count but in the last second they transcend in epic form and with great justice, evil loses.\n\nThis is what is drummed into our heads as children from day 1. We believe this as adults. It almost feels real...\n\nBut it's not real, unfortunately. The **bad** guy wins in this universe, and everything points to that being true. The best, most skilled, manipulative, evil, ultrapowerful thing which can *convince* everyone they're good, **wins**. That's psychopathy. As a once \"obnoxious atheist\", turned \"banal atheist\", the Christians were completely delusional, *except* they were sort of right about two things. The first is original sin and that we're all inherently evil, but it's simply because natural selection makes us evil. The second is they were right about depicting Lucifer in art for that short period of time, as a beautiful, charming figure. That's exactly what evil is. Evil is indistinguishable from pure good. That's what **makes** it evil, makes it totalitarian, and authoritarian. Makes it hypnotic.\n\nNotice how quickly that depiction ended? For the vast majority of history including the present, evil is depicted as this ugly, scary, off putting thing. Golly, **who** could such a cartoonish depiction possibly benefit? The Sumerians which spread the good vs. evil myths of their time, all the way to modern times where Hollywood and Disney churn out \"Good guys win\" propaganda, **who**, I ask you, could possibly benefit from such a meme?\n\nEvil benefits. By depicting evil as evil, and not as charming irresistible camouflaged psychopath, evil essentially confuses everyone and enslaves them in a false conception of reality. We are all victims of this myth, and most of us will never wake up from it, because to honestly plug this hypothesis in and ask yourself if you're actually in a world of covert psychopathic robots(Which would explain a *lot*), is too psychologically destabilizing for most people.

This is simply a fantasy. There is no conceivable \"ethical\" outcome in this world-- it just gets worse while *appearing* to get better via propaganda. And the propaganda will *only* get worse from here, because the power people? **They** get the new super-technology that will be indistinguishable from magic.

What is *your* motive in continually engaging me this way?\n\nI'm glad to have a discussion with you, but could you consider engaging just the ideas themselves? It helps to do it in a way that is actually open to ones that you strongly disagree with. If you believe something which I think is wrong, but you're actually right and I'm the one who is wrong, I consider that something of an emergency. I need to know what you know, so I can stop being wrong. I don't care about the given set of beliefs and representations I have about the world right now, they have no special attachment to me. I just care about being right. If everything I believe right now is wrong, I want to be not wrong as quickly as humanly possible.\n\nWould you say the same for yourself? Does the way you engage with ideas that you find strongly disagreeable, reflect that? Worth thinking deeply about every single day for life, not just reading once and forgetting.\n\n&gt;Your whole thing about good never defeating evil because good would have to break the rules presumes that to be good is to follow the rules. But sometimes those rules and the system itself that props up those rules are inherently unjust and need to be unturned and you don't have to be evil to see that or to rise against it. Also revolutions have happened throughout history so they're obviously not fiction though of course that doesn't mean they're always led by good people or that they always succeed.\n\nAh, okay, so good by definition must follow some rules, no matter what those rules are, right? And good has to be in relation *to* something, right? So even if one's ethics come up with something completely counter-intuitive like, \"Good is about breaking as many rules as possible\", then this has to be in relation is something we'd call \"Evil\", right? Otherwise they don't describe anything, since they're both just breaking as many rules as possible and racing to win.\n\nEvil, on the other hand, can't be bound by any rules. That's what makes it a truly open-ended description of evil. Evil isn't a cartoon character like something you see in a Hollywood film, Fictional story, Disney movie, etc. The sorts of stories and movies we've grown up with *all* of our lives, and have shaped what we think good\/evil is. It should be very interesting to us that just about **every** story seems to be representing a confused picture of what evil is. Read that sentence again. This should be a very *curious* hint for discovering something important about our reality.\n\nWhat is evil? Evil can do *anything* good can do on top of doing evil things. It is bound by no rules, other than 'win'. If the Night King or whatever villain from whatever action drama people watch these days, was *truly* evil, they wouldn't look like a goofy, scary demon that expresses just how little they care about sentient things that can suffer, and constantly signals how they are some indomitable, dark force coming to enslave or kill you. That's a false and totally misleading description of evil. If the Night King were truly evil, they would be most likeable character in the story, the most charming, the most agreeable, the most noble and-- happen to be super powerful at the same time. Some of that power would be concealed. And almost no one would have a *clue* they were evil, and couldn't even fight back. **That's** the power of evil.\n\nThere's nothing stopping evil from doing a charity event for cancer kids, for instance. Yes, it's a good deed, right? But the fact of what makes it evil, is the motive and the context, right? Not the superficial action on the surface. They could do a child cancer event *just* for the sake of gaining favor of the public, not because they think cancer in children is a horrific injustice in the world resulting from mentally ill apes playing with radiation for the purpose of ruling the world. And they could use the money and status they gain to fund any truly evil action they wanted. Good doesn't have this luxury. Good, to be good, needs to actually give a shit that the kids have cancer and acknowledge that suffering. If it's just looking out for itself, then that isn't good, that's instead just pro-social psychopathy. It's just an *accidental* good, and probably a *net* bad, because the thing *gained* from the accidental good by this evil is greater than the good deed done, often times. If there wasn't more to gain, evil simply *wouldn't* be interested in pretending to be good.\n\nDoes this mean good can't do *anything* evil can do? Of course not, I'm not arguing for some kind of Kantian deontology where all murder is wrong, even to save a trillion innocent people being tortured. But certain contexts *truly* are off limits for good, otherwise they'd be indistinguishable from evil. This is a significant disadvantage because evil is already in power. The entire power structure of our reality, from the small scale, like in work environments(we don't have to kid ourselves-- the least ethical people get ahead in our society-- notice how well this all describes the *perfect* boss\/CEO criminal), to the large scale-- the global stage-- where it is simply a representation of who will \"break the most eggs\" to get ahead. This is why psychopathy is so *good* at being evil. It has no issues with breaking eggs. It has no issues patiently waiting with their finger on the nuke button or the chemical weapons order or the genetic engineering order or the propaganda order. It just *doesn't* care, except to win. It doesn't care about injustice, it doesn't panic, it doesn't care about collateral damage or that it's fucking up life for people struggling to exist in a cruel and unfair world, it does a great job of pretending to be good when it isn't hiding, and it will stop at nothing to win. This is how it has been, for thousands of years.\n\n&gt;Also revolutions have happened throughout history so they're obviously not fiction though of course that doesn't mean they're always led by good people or that they always succeed.\n\nYes, well maybe I phrased things too presumptively here. I didn't mean that things we call revolutions never happen, or that great changes don't happen, I just mean that if what I'm saying is correct, then these revolutions can't be true progress, just superficial progress as an eviler force beats another evil force in power. A kind of superficial event which convinces everyone of it's goodness, is taught to children in schools, but doesn't actually fix the **fundamental** problems which are fixable. A scenario where it seems like so much has changed, but in actuality, *very* little has changed. You just got some new toys or some new comforts, and in the event of a dramatic change of ethical revolution, I would speculate this meant a *dramatic* power shift for an eviler force. If evil only distills and gets stronger with time, since it operates under the shadow of camouflaging propaganda in the form of myth\/story\/\"education\", and is strengthened by a selection game, then any truly good thing happening means a far greater evil has happened\/been instilled.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567874968,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ezfa1wg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d0juks","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ezf07n7","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/d0juks\/media_just_cant_stop_presenting_horrifying\/ezfa1wg\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576355031,"score":-2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Most people have complex motives behind their actions and usually it isn't just \"I want to express what I'm thinking\". If you want to claim that you are just interested in expressing your opinion, cool, but what's the point according to your own ideology?\n\nImagine if everything involving the most important questions on something as complicated as this was engaged with in that way. Would that actually be a good thing? You seem to be mistaking a virtue in brevity for the handicaps of human bandwidth and our attention deficit disorder and anti-intellectual memes, which used to be a core feature of the conservative political right to stupefy those poor into believing things like taxes were evil(What a *successful* trick, you have to admit), but now unfortunately express themselves in the resentfulness of the political left. We get a bad taste in our mouths when we see an SAT-word using proletariat, and that is a bad thing I think. Who do these memes really serve, exactly?\n\nAs for my 'motive', I only care about expressing and engaging with ideas and having them scrutinized like you're doing right now. My motive is to place my idea down in front of everyone, give everyone a hammer, and say: \"If you guys wouldn't mind, stress test this idea with your ideas. I want to know if my idea is right, because I don't want to be wrong.\" This is **hard** to do. Give yourself 10 seconds to think of the last time you changed your mind on an *important* question. It can't possibly happen that often, and as a human being, I relate to you here. This is the most basic intellectual endeavor anyone can do, though. Notice the opposite of this behavior, which is dogma-- the death of the mind. A religious conviction that *your* representation of reality is true and infallible, and need not be tested. Which approach is better, in your eyes?\n\n&gt; If you want to claim that you are just interested in expressing your opinion, cool, but what's the point according to your own ideology?\n\nOkay, let's compare answers then in regards to how and why we express our ideologies. I've already told you what I believe is most important, the truth. You said I annoy you because you think I'm full of shit(this is a *really* elaborate waste of time for me then, if this is right...), so I find you often reacting to me with hostility even though you admit I'm received well here. The fact that I'm received well and you disagree is what seems to bother you. Can it *just* be the case that people have *different* understandings of the world, and if we happen to care about understanding the world at all, we should engage with others in a way that can better make sense of reality? Is our mission to be some kind of hive mind, or are we still trying to figure reality out? Notice how the approach I'm attempting differs from the question I posed to you when I asked you if you were committed to what is true, where you ignored my question and responded with a definition of the word \"haughty\" instead, and just dropped the mic.\n\nWhat's the purpose of that? Are you *trying* to say something? Are you saying I am haughty and proud because I asked you if you would describe your intellectual approach here as open? Are you aware of or interested in the fact that the burden is on me to decipher what you're trying to say when your only reply is a *definition* of a word? Isn't that a little ironic, given the specific word you posed? This three sentence rule doesn't seem to be working, and I think it would be better if people had grown up discussions instead where, they engage with each other in a way where they at least accept the *possibility* that the other could be right, and that we can be wrong, and we want to improve ourselves.\n\n&gt;Separating the people from their ideas is impractical and inadvisable.\n\nWell no, okay-- let's get to the actual meat of valuable disagreements. What is described in that sentence can't be how right and wrong works. If the genocidal dictator from Cambodia Pol Pot discovered the cure for cancer, we don't say, \"Yeah, but it was *Pol Pot* so we have to throw this away!\" If he discovered something true about ethics, this would also *simply* be true. If he discovered something true about politics, again, that wouldn't make it false, it would have to be true too. We wouldn't be endorsing the evil human being he was when we admit he was right where ever he happened to be right. We don't endorse *anything* about the person, because reality and truth are divorced from the person expressing it in the most interesting and meaningful way that anything can be true. It's extremely dangerous, and a sign of ideological intoxication to argue against people rather than ideas\/behaviors, so here I express worry for you as a fellow human being. \n\n&gt;Nope. Sometimes Good figures out that the rules aren't worth following anymore and people who are good change their mind in line with what their conscience says. And people's conscience can change over time to reflect the rules they want to follow, good people aren't necessarily static.\n\nI think we more or less agree here, but first of all, I don't get what conscience has to offer here. What someone's conscience says isn't some magical indicator of what is good. Good has to make sense, it can't be some emotional thing or whimsical feeling. To frame this in the moral terms you laid out just now, it is possible for someone's conscience to say that the rules one follows *are* still worth following, when in fact, the ethical move is to **not** follow what one's conscience says. Here I happen to agree with you. The disagreement seems to have been \"no, good must not follow rules, because conscience changes what the rules are\". I think it doesn't matter what changes what the rules are for the fact to be that the rules *can* change, since everything is dynamic. I tried to make that clear when I said I'm **not** arguing for some Kantian deontology where murder is always wrong even to save a trillion lives. Rules changing don't mean there aren't rules, which was my original point-- Good **has** to be bound by rules which evil isn't, that's what **defines** good in relation to evil. It does *not* mean that good follows the same exact rules over and over.\n\n&gt;False. Evil people can come up with their own rules and often people do come up with their own rules or procedures which people of Good conscience resist. I think you'd benefit from looking at the D&amp;D alignment chart (no I'm not joking) and realizing that lawful evil is a possibility for people, not just in fiction.\n\nRight, well again, this is just what I'd call memetic engineering of evil. Evil dictates a false representation of evil to obscure itself. There is no \"lawful evil\" unless we're talking about the sole law of 'win'. I think we'd benefit from not paying attention to the representations of evil in fantasy and sci fi, which has always told us how the good guys win with superpowers or magic or technology, an ancient meme that benefits evil more than anyone. This sounds like some grand conspiracy but it's not, and can be explained in game theoretical terms. You can skip this paragraph if you're bored with these sort of details, it really isn't crucial to my argument. Anyway, imagine you have 3 tribes all competing. They all need to maximize evil to win, because if one promotes true goodness, they will be dominated by the nearby rule-breaking, evil-maximizing tribes. So a kind of meta-game ensues where each tribe needs to perfect the idea of evil, which is the appearance of good, with an evil core(evil wears a mask). The meme of goodness has value to the society because it needs the illusion of good to make progress and make people in the tribe feel the project is worth pursuing. If a tribe figures out that evil is actually the winning strategy, they just off themselves or naively fight onward and get eaten by the sadistic cannibals nearest to them(who of course, roleplay and truly believe they are the civilized or righteous tribe), who play by no rules other than 'win'. So if you're the chief of one of these tribes, you are in a prisoner's dilemma with the other tribe chiefs. You would each *benefit* from being good, but because the incentives say: \"If you can perfect the camouflage of evil, you really **do** win this game!\", and that is exactly what happens. It favors the best cheater, so everyone is forced to cheat or die. It doesn't even matter if anyone is *aware* of these rules, the rules decide the outcome anyway. The good either die or get exploited(history supports this more than some truly pure success story we'd expect from real progress). It's the incentives of the game that shape the winner. There is no reason to think that in 2019 these incentives have changed-- everyone is in this high stakes, winner take all game and all people on Earth, all life on Earth, are the unfortunate victims.\n\n&gt;Refer back to \"haughty\". This is another reason why you irk me, you come off as grossly self-important and that irks me into a response, at least partially anyways. I'm also just an argumentative person, I'll admit.\n\nInteresting. I'm sure you're not the only person who thinks that, but I nonetheless respect the feedback. My own self-reflections here tell me this is at least party due to being on the autism spectrum. Functional autism often manifests in very forward, \"matter-of-fact\" speech patterns, and I can sometimes sense this is a major turn off to certain people. I will even go so far to say that if I weren't *me*, whoever I'd be may find themselves annoyed at me, if that makes sense. I'm also low in the trait: Agreeableness, like you(it's sometimes difficult to *not* disagree with something that I find wrong), but also very high in the trait \"Openness to experience\".\n\n(Page 1, Page 2 continued below)","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567897344,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ezgiysr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d0juks","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ezffqr8","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/d0juks\/media_just_cant_stop_presenting_horrifying\/ezgiysr\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576376465,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

You are conflating psychopathy or sociopaths with \"evil\" (not all evil people are psychopaths and I've heard of folks without empathy who ration out good on a purely consequentialist basis, but I digress) but they aren't the same things. Donald Trump according to many is an evil person, but he still has a code he (allegedly) has to follow to do his evil acts or to get others (ICE) to do it for him. For someone who mocks fictional displays of evil you definitely have a supernatural sense of evil. Also, have you watched movies like American Psycho? Because that's the movie for you, if not.\n\nHere's another point where I don't even see terrible disagreement between us(I could be wrong), but just confusion about small semantic differences. I don't think there's some \"magical\" evil in the world, whatever evil is has to be expressed in descriptive, objective terms. Evil can't be a matter of opinion, it has to map reality and the suffering of things that can suffer, somehow. There's nothing supernatural about evil, whatever it is can only arise from natural processes. Evil evolves like anything else and gets rewarded over time because that's what happens to win on this rock, and possibly in this universe. If evil was *terrible* for survival, it wouldn't *be* here for long-- it would be impossible. In regards to empathy, I don't think empathy is necessarily 'good' either. I was asked this question yesterday, and I said something like: \"Empathy isn't a marker for goodness intrinsically, because someone can even have empathy for a sad Nazi's failure to gas more Jews on any given day. Empathy *alone* can't be the bullseye.\" \n\nGoodness can't just be a feeling, like I said earlier, it has to be **true** like 2+2=4. It has to be **wrong** to enslave things for your own selfish purposes, it has to be wrong to design and encourage a system where people are treated like cattle from childhood and corralled from one form of drudgery to another for life(It's wrong to treat *cattle* this way!), otherwise meaning doesn't exist and there wouldn't be a meaningful difference between speaking garbled at each other like 'gorgerkjd dgfkjlxd tnhfdo dfkdjf'. Either it is possible to be less and less evil, and more and more good, or these are completely meaningless descriptions. There has to be a real moral difference between raping someone for pure selfish reasons, and saying \"no, I won't do this-- it is **wrong**\". That difference is real and meaningful. It's not just a matter of opinion. It's possible to be wrong about these terms, like someone who believes 2+2=5 is *really* wrong. Even if climate change kills everything on the planet other than microorganisms without brains, 2+2=5 is *still* wrong, there's just no one around with a brain to know it's wrong. As for American Psycho, as with your DnD example, I lump just about all popular forms of media and entertainment in our society into the trash bin of propaganda. Anything that tries to describe evil, and is popular, is almost certainly beneficial to evil itself. Bateman is a total and utter cartoon character that's even more obscuring of evil than the goofy Night King from GoT. That's just not how evil manifests in our world at its purest form. This even includes the DSM's description of Anti Social Personality Disorder, or descriptions of Psychopathy, and Sociopathy. These are poor(i would argue probably *intentionally* poor) descriptions of evil. The purest evil isn't *overtly* glib like Bateman, not even Psychopaths like Ted Bundy over-act to such a degree. This is at best an utterly banal psychopathy, and it would get exposed quickly by any socially aware party. Just ask yourself: What would you think if you *met* Patrick Bateman? Honestly.\n\n Evil is far more hidden and camouflaged than that. I'm sure you've already seen the gif I post regarding what nature does with [camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) given enough evolutionary time, but here it is again for anyone who hasn't. Psychopathy doesn't even *need* to wait for a new generation to evolve this way, because it's being stress tested and evolving on a daily basis where as literal camouflage in that insect isn't quite so fast as human social systems.\n\n&gt;This is a very difficult philosophical question that everyone from Kant to Bentham to Sartre to all the rest have been arguing about for hundreds of years. So excuse me if I'm a little skeptical that you have the definitive answer here. For what it's worth though, while the motive and context surely matter, I wouldn't say they are the end-all given consequences also matter (I'm not a utilitarian tho, to be clear).\n\nGood, you *should* be skeptical. I agree that no one system can possibly be the answer, it can't *only* be consequences, or *just* some form of utilitarianism, or *just* some form of rule-based ethics. We can create reductios to demonstrate how all of these systems on their own come to absurd conclusions. Utility is good, but it's not the end all be all, same for consequences, same for rules(unless is some truly ultimate \"infinity of knowledge\" sense but I guess you could say that for consequences too).\n\n&gt;What does this sentence do for your argument exactly? Make cancer seem worse and if so is that necessary? Does it help you feel validated about your worldview that we live in a hellscape with no possibility of progress?\n\nThe sentence is meant to show that one could act in a purely manipulative and selfish and superficial terms, but I'm guessing you're only asking about the last bit about child cancer. You seem to ask, \"why do you have to say cancer results from psychopaths radiating and polluting the planet-- is that *really* necessary?\", right? Correct me if I've read your concern the wrong way. First, I don't know why you say the phrase \"make cancer *seem* worse\", when it's the exactly opposite that is operative in our brains. We are in fact *allergic* to how bad it seems, haven't grasped the scope of how insane it is, and your question here is an expression of that allergy. In ELI5 terms: \"We don't like bad things, it make us feel the bad feelings, so we find ways to not feel and be exposed to the bad things\". I value framing reality as honestly as possible. Even if reality is a horror show, which I believe it is. I'm not sure if you think I'm being edgy here or something(a truly shameful meme which only benefits apex psychopathy), but the way I see it, I'm sugarcoating how bad this all is. If it were possible to really \"let loose\", I would ask you, \"Hey, do you want to see how insane this gets? Look at this\" and I'd ask you to look at all the human-caused cancer victims on the entire planet just for the sake of jarring you awake to the fallout(both literal and metaphorical) of the maniacs that rule our reality. I wish there was some art that does this effectively, and in fact this is one of the few ways we can sublimate our horror because it's too repulsive and disruptive to our psychological digestive systems, but I have no such art for cancer. Here's one however for the war games the psychopath LARPers of our world play in the [middle east](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Tj9lj4P.jpg)(NSFL). This is real life for people, please keep in mind. Real human beings. This is not the Dungeons and Dragons or the Disney adaptation we escape to and laugh and enjoy(or shit on as a hobby\/bonding exercise). Sorry if it bothers, that I can understand well enough, but it's time to be frank about our conditions on this planet-- hopefully that is understandable. The stakes are *rather* high given the scope and scale of sentient suffering.\n\n&gt;I don't understand the argument here. Are you trying to say it's really hard to be good or impossible? You are also conflating acting in a self-interested way with psychopathy which is also conflated with evil, still.\n\nReally hard to be good on the micro level(good deeds are possible, but hard and rarely genuine for a species like ours), and impossible to be good in the macro level(evil gets stronger and stronger until it finally wins the universe). Good may pop up from time to time(more by accident if anything), but generally it is co-opted by evil and added to the camouflage system given enough time. Whatever a process of perfecting good is, a perfected version of evil perfects the idea of *pretending* to be that, *plus* successfully breaking rules in the shadows, rules which-- to some degree-- good cannot break because it becomes either indistinguishable from\/more evil than evil, or remains weaker than evil. In the long run, only evil can win. Re: 'conflating',  well, no, I don't think self-interest is *inherently* evil, it just tends to be, surely that is uncontroversial. But yes, psychopathy is evil, and evil is a simple disorder\/confusion, a property of which is a paradoxical tendency to fail to understand itself in a way that can get better because its \"operating system\"(genes, neuroanatomy, psychology, phenotype) and the environment it sits in promote being evil.\n\n&gt;Who is we? I'm guessing you mean \"we\" in the general sense? If not, yeah, the user you are arguing with named AbolishWork, probably doesn't need to be convinced that the people in power have Problems.\n\nThis is unnecessarily hostile to someone who agrees with you in regards to abolishing work.\n\n(This is page 2, last page below)","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567897358,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ezgj04r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d0juks","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ezffqr8","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/d0juks\/media_just_cant_stop_presenting_horrifying\/ezgj04r\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576376481,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

But it seems like earlier you were conflating the two and treating them as the same, so this is confusing. As for your historical analysis, I find it lacking because the past thousands of years has also been full of people caring, giving, sharing, rising up against power, etc.\n\nPsychopathy and evil are interchangeable to me. It may be meaningful to call gradations of intent IRT malice, evil, where as deep belief one is doing the right thing but causing immense destruction and horror can be called pathology but not evil, I will grant those semantics, but I see all of it as just one big pathological evil-production complex, and splitting hairs here isn't terribly interesting to me. I think the key to understanding things here is asking why this pathology occurs in the first place, what incentives exist for this kind of exploitation and sadism and callousness? Is the pathology an advantage, too?\n\n Intentions matter, but they stop mattering after a while. If someone punches you with intent every single day because they don't like you as a result of some bias, and if someone punches you as a result of an involuntary spasm and deeply apologizes every day and *really* means it(we lie detect perfectly), the intent in the second scenario really does matter for the first one or two or however many times that scales with your patience. But after a while, it too becomes about as insane as the first scenario. You don't go \"Phew! At least this guy isn't *intentionally* punching me and getting his kicks from it.\" The morally relevant question is the fact that you're getting punched over and over for no reason and it has to stop.\n\n&gt;IDK, I'm gonna say that the South being beaten by the North was Good, Actually and the Jamaicans fighting back against the slave holders was also Good. There's also been other revolutions where kings have been ousted and representative democracies were instated and, again, gonna have to say that's Good even if I'm an anarchist and am against all rulership. The fact is, throughout history although neither side was anywhere close to perfect, sometimes the slightly better side wins.\n\nSure, I agree there too except in the very last bit. I've had more and more anarchist sympathies lately, even though the idea is new to me, but I suspect that at least in the most ideal sense, anarchism appears superior to rulership in ethical terms because intuitively there seems to be more injustice and suffering in rulership than in anarchy. I think rulership may just be a trick that gives people a false sense of security from the setting of 'the wild', but paradoxically cranks the dial on the scary thing people were afraid of in the first place, by organizing it and crystallizing it, while *disorganizing* the common people in a false sense of order. I'm just not sure if there's a form of anarchy that can ever manifest from human beginnings, given what I believe about evil. It could be a simple hack though, where we just need to figure out one tiny \"rule\" to make it viable. That I am open to. I think the world is basically about creating speedbumps for evil. Whatever comes from the most perfect form of anarchy would still be evil in time, but it would probably be less evil than what comes from the way things are going now? These last parts are pure speculation on my part, I have no strong feelings at all here.\n\n&gt;I've wasted enough time on you and this post. I mostly wanted to thoroughly read you and see if you had anything to actually say and I don't think you do. You spend a lot of energy, time and words (way more than 3 sentences) just to say a lot of nothing.\n\nHmm, that's puzzling to hear. You asked dozens of questions in your response to me, were these rhetorical questions you weren't actually interested in being answered? Were you just talking *at* me here this whole time, or engaging in a way where my answers could actually inform you and change your mind? If they could change your mind, I can't imagine how telling someone they \"say a lot of nothing\" makes sense if you expect your questions to actually be answered, nor does it make sense to even engage with someone whose ideas you believe you cannot possibly change your mind about. I think part of you at least does want your ideas challenged, and part of you clearly wants to challenge ideas, and that I relate to like I told you. I just don't think the way forward is acting as if we can't be wrong. We're just having a discussion about philosophy and reality on reddit, it doesn't need to be so hostile and dogmatic when we probably agree in more ways than we disagree, and have more in common with ourselves than our common enemies.

It doesn't mean \"stop being bad\", because if it did, our world wouldn't look the way it does. It just says, \"Be *really* sneaky and be *really* sure you *need* to do that fucked up thing, or you will be hurting.\"\n\nPeople call that \"Non-zero sum\" or \"win-win\"(by people I mean scientists), but I don't think that is the case completely...

The phenotype involves things like domination, callousness, self-absorption, and then wraps it all up in the bows and frills of deception, manipulation, and charm. The most skilled cheater will always beat the most skilled rule follower, given all other things are equal. If the prisoner's dilemma says cooperate, the one who most perfectly exploits cooperators, wins. If this means signaling that you're the most benevolent thing out there, the most friendly thing, the most trustworthy, while secretly(secretly here could even mean unconsciously) exhibiting Dark Triad traits, well then, you just win if you're also the most skilled player, don't you?\n\nIt's useful to tie this fact of nature, \"survival of the best cheater\", with the second law of thermodynamics. If bad actors naturally win, they also naturally tend to stay in power and win more and more, only dethroned by worse actors, as we move along the entropic gradient. This is because it's much easier for someone in the lead to play things slow and react or make small moves that ruin the gamestate for the stragglers catching up, who are already at a disadvantage because they're probably bound by ethical rules to some degree(You want moral progress and to fix the world, right?). It's easier to break something than it is to fix it, due to entropy, so you can never really catch up.

But what about the quality of life, the fact that it is bad rather than good? Would that change the fact that life has meaning? This is also easy to test, because we can imagine a scenario where someone is living the worst possible life in the universe(non-stop pointless torture), and someone who is living the best possible life, where they report that life isn't just good, it's fantastic and sublime and ecstatic. How would you describe the contradiction there? The fact that there are different subjective experiences can't be the thing which gives or removes life's meaning, it would only tell us that someone can be confused about life's meaning\/lack of meaning. So what is it, exactly, that makes you say meaning **doesn't exist**? It sounds like you're just saying \"This sucks\", but not \"This has no meaning\".

Galen Strawson restates what's called a \"Basic Argument\" for moral responsbility that goes:\n\n* You do what you do, in any given situation you find yourself, because of the way you **are**.\n* To be truly morally responsible for what you do you must be responsible for the way you **are** -- at least in certain crucial *mental* respects.\n* You cannot be *truly* responsible for the way you **are**, because to be truly responsible for the way you **are**, you must have intentionally brought about the way you **are**, and that is impossible.\n\nThere's much more to it than that, but that is the gist. You don't choose to be born, first of all. You don't choose your parents, your geography, your genes, what *time* you were born(the year 1700 , or 2000-- why are you born *at the moment you were born* rather than in the future or past? It's totally mysterious and outside of your control). You don't choose your life experiences. You don't choose which friends you meet, who hurts you, who you hurt, you don't choose what you're ignorant of, and you don't choose when something convinces you to stop being ignorant.\n\nThe idea of being in such a scenario where you're just a ragdoll being thrown around from causes you didn't author yourself, and being **blamed** is simply nonsense. Now, we can understand *why* the world blames people, and rewards people, and *why* people feel shame and pride, but this doesn't mean that it's **true** and logical to feel this way. This doesn't mean we shouldn't reward people(there are reasons to reward people even if they ultimately were just 'lucky', just to promote good things) and this doesn't mean we should not imprison say, serial killers(there are still reasons to isolate\/rehabilitate people who do harm to others, even if those people didn't ever choose to be the people they became), but to truly believe that people are *responsible*, and need to be punished because they could have done otherwise-- that is completely fictional, and causes immense human suffering.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567976445,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ezlgljv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d1g8lm","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_d1g8lm","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/d1g8lm\/apologize_to_yourself\/ezlgljv\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576462319,"score":13,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I think lying is basically the smallest scale form of aggression. We're basically depriving another person access to 'reality', for our own self-interested gain. We treat them like a child, and we already treat children horribly this way by intentionally misleading them. If I lie I basically tell you, \"You aren't going to gain access to this thing I know. :)\" Either for your own good, or for revenge, or because you're the 'other' so I'm just going to be petty or selfish like most people are. Our culture, but especially work culture, completely normalizes lying as some kind of right, and even virtue, in the form of \"white lies\", but this is honestly the most *basic* way in which all human beings simply refuse to work with each other. It's the foundation of incivility. It says: \"I don't trust you with the truth\" , and at the same time, when the liar is exposed, tells the other party: \"You shouldn't trust *me*, since I just lied to your\/someone else's face.\"\n\nIf you doubt this, just consider what you'd think of someone you were socializing with, who had to engage with a third person who popped up, either via phone or briefly joining you two, and this person lied with a totally carefree, glib attitude to this third person they appeared to be friendly with, and then resumed chatting you up after they were rid of them. Any sane person immediately goes: \"Well.. shit... is this person lying to *me* this way too? Would I trust this person with anything important?\" Just imagine what work in a culture would look like if everyone was certain lying was wrong. Imagine what *politics* would look like. Completely alien, that's what. That's how saturated we are in lies.\n\nWe don't only tell people \"You're not allowed to know reality\", but in the event we are the ones who are wrong about this truth which we see ourselves protecting or depriving, we rob ourselves of being corrected. It's the ultimate anti-progressive, obscurantist attitude.\n\nTo frame this in a work context, we see all the endless incentives where someone in power above us, lies to us. This is obvious both *inside* a company, and the way business lies to the public to protect their image. Is this product bad for your health? Is this product implicated in something that you would never buy it, if you had only known the conditions it was produced under? I'm sure you can think of millions of ways that business is full of lies. This is coming just off the top of my head, but I just remembered I'm constantly frustrated at the grocery store, because I'm trying to compare the prices of things, and they *literally* have one product in price per grams, and another in price per ounces, and another in price per lb, and it's all just intentionally designed to mislead you and waste your time. Who actually benefits from this manipulation? The company who has a shitty price\/weight ratio, and benefits from you being too frustrated to even do the math for yourself so you're forced to be less informed. It disincentivizes you from looking for the right choice when the truth would simply *free* you a tiny, tiny bit. The truth just *isn't* profitable, and lies are. The world is *utterly* saturated in the lies of business, and the lies of people in general, and this is probably one of the most banal pathologies we're suffering from that people barely seem to reflect on because we're all so used to it.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567994912,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ezmo89c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d1idtu","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_d1idtu","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/d1idtu\/what_is_unethical_as_fuck_but_is_extremely_common\/ezmo89c\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576483358,"score":5,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

So the assumption is ethical behavior not only takes more effort but requires some sort of external moral energy input (maybe I'm over stressing the analogy), while the default behavior if no effort is exerted is not moral? \n\nI'm not sure if it's *analogous*, since ethical moves can probably occur in high entropy in some narrow sense, but if we look at the full scope of a low entropy-&gt;high entropy gradient, I think evil is guaranteed to flourish in any sort of selection game the likes of which occurs with biology on Earth. I don't mean some charicature of evil which is represented in media(Don't think of the Night King from Game of Thrones), but rather whatever is evil will appear good in a very compelling way.\n\n&gt;This seems to work with the Christian framework of morality. The \"natural man\" or that state in which we exist if great effort to overcome the default\/base tendencies is not exerted, is evil. Only those who accept the divine (external to the closed system of the individual) influence of god, and practice a rigorous set of behavioral modifications are not evil.\n\n\u200bI'm an atheist, but I think the Christians were right(accidentally? Don't know) about at least two things. Original sin seems to be an astute observation if we're just concluding that humanity is inherently evil, and that's just due to natural selection. If one looks at our species after hundreds of millions of years of selection on an entropy gradient, this should be accurate assessment. Whether you want to say evil or psychopathic-- whatever, these are interchangeable to me and splitting hairs here I don't think is super interesting. If ethical aliens discovered us, it would be in their best interest to 1) Destroy us 2) Avoid us 3) Contain us 4) Rehabilitate us. If this universe is evil prone, I think it's unlikely that a space-faring species will be particularly ethical, however. They will have to have arisen through a long selection game where powerful cheaters are rewarded, like we did\/are.\n\nThe second reference is just the scatterings in art where lucifer\/satan is depicted as [good looking and admirable](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FLXueYI.jpg). I think a better job could have been done, but that's probably asking too much. Evil basically has two features, it is 1) hidden and 2) very good-looking(i mean that in every way possible). I think it should be very interesting to everyone that essentially all media portrays evil as some grotesque cartoonish thing, it's beyond what one would accept as just naive or confused.\n\nFor the prisoner's dilemma, I should have linked [this](https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/613585\/prisoners-dilemma-shows-how-exploitation-is-a-basic-property-of-human-society\/) article to sum up what I'm convinced by.\n\n\n&gt;I'm curious, have you other comparisons of physical sciences to ethical thought?\n\nHmmm... nothing to share at the moment, but I'll think about it\/try to remember. Edit: Yes, I thought of something else, but this is a riff on the natural selection+entropy=evil thing. The solution to the Fermi paradox here would be that all the aliens we should expect to see but don't, would be obscured and camouflaged, since camouflage(deception\/manipulation) is part of the phenotype of evil(which is just psychopathy).","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568001620,"distinguished":null,"edited":1568008108,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ezn6n1z","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d15r7s","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ezn2esd","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/d15r7s\/why_do_sociopaths_and_psychopaths_often_become\/ezn6n1z\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576492225,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

And it doesn't get better, because the other kingdoms get more and more evil in trying to ruin your kingdom so they can take your land and mine the gold from your mountains. And you must in turn also get more evil, and get better and better at *hiding* your evil, because you can't just start killing your enemies, because the other kingdoms will say \"Look at this evil, murderous kingdom\" and then everyone gangs up on you and kills you.\n\nSo where were we? Life is very bad for the peasants. They want to die. But... this is a problem for you, as king. If you let your peasants die, you lose the game. The enemy kingdom will beat yours. So you must do **everything** in your power to prevent your peasants and scribes and soldiers, from dying too early. They need to live as long as possible until you can't squeeze out any more usefulness from them. If you fail to do this, the enemy kingdom will eat you.\n\nWhat can you do? You can invent a lie, first of all. You can say, \"god will torture you for eternity if you kill yourself.\" This scares ignorant peasants, and is a very effective lie when everyone is very stupid. But when people get smarter and stop believing in god, this doesn't work. The next thing you can do is make it extremely taboo via social pressure. Spread the lie that killing yourself is selfish, and makes you a horrible person. You can spread other lies, like life is very worth while living. Or spread platitudes, like \"It gets better.\"\n\nIf you reach an age where \"hospitals\" and \"medicine\" and \"nurses\" exist, and complex economy exists, it will be *very* important even to not let the very elderly, who are suffering, die. No mercy here. But why? Aren't old people no longer useful to the kingdom? Well, this is true a very long time ago, where your work was what made you useful, or your ability to walk. But now, being sick in a bed is very useful. Eating pills every day, getting injected, being given oxygen tanks, this all implicates economy because all of these things *cost* something, so the total of all the materials, bed sheets, drugs, syringes, IV drips, nurses, room rent, adult diapers, etc, *all* of it, in the scale of a huge superpower, is billions of dollars. The price for a single peaceful death drug for all elderly, would be closer to 2 million dollars, give or take a few million.\n\nThis is why no one is allowed to die.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568014688,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ezo0utt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d1nl47","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_d1nl47","permalink":"\/r\/suicidology\/comments\/d1nl47\/why_is_it_that_society_wants_to_avoid_the_option\/ezo0utt\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576506847,"score":17,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"suicidology","subreddit_id":"t5_2shhl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/suicidology","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

We know this from thought experiments where the peak configurations of the universe are presented, and life\/creation of life can *still* be argued against convincingly. Even in a welcoming universe, even in a universe where everyone was subjectively deeply connected to one another and found tremendous meaning, you can reach Efilism and Antinatalism without an appeal to existentialism. The same is true for the existence of God. The existence of God wouldn't make wrong things right, even if God commanded them(Divine Command theory is false, is my claim). This is how we know atheism is perfectly detachable from efilism. Whether you believe god exists or not, whether god really exists or not, these don't really change the arguments from what I can see at least.\n\nAll you need for Efilism is the demand to justify life. Why should life go on? Is a universe full of lots of breathing, eating, sleeping, shitting, murdering, ejaculating, menstruating, torturing and laughing things-- *really* worth it over a universe of just rocks? Efilism simply says \"No. This is *not* worth it.\" Is there a non-zero risk of life going bad? Very bad? Worst case scenario? If so, life is wrong. Can we ask a living thing if it wants this? No, we can't, therefore it is wrong to impose for the same reasons it's wrong to impose something you want onto a coma patient who can't consent. If you don't understand it's wrong to impose, you have a cognitive and moral deficiency unless you can provide an argument why you have the right to force this on someone, or why you have the right to risk this all going wrong. It's hard to create such arguments because DNA currently hold us all in a **hostage** situation. We have a gun to our heads, and Efilists and Anitnatalists are the hostage negotiators, trying to say, \"Please just put the gun down. Let's talk.\" It's just that simple to me, no more than this is needed for Efilism\/AN. There are other arguments but, they are just adornments. These adornments are often necessary. Benatar has taken this approach with the asymmetry argument and others who argue that life is simply *bad* in other ways.\n\nYou usually need to convince people that life is *really* bad first, and then they tend to grasp the purely logical arguments that life has no current justification to exist, and bringing more life without consent is morally unjustified, but you don't even need to prove life is bad in principle. Life could be good for *everyone*, and the core arguments for Efilism\/AN would stand.

I think even the best of us are simply monsters in waiting. People who to some degree don't realize how self-absorbed we all are, how lacking in empathy we are, how often we lie, how we're constantly competing, provoking, and so on.\n\nOne strong aspect here is self-deception. We can all understand how successful lying is an adaptive behavior. Just think of the earliest human lies, and how obvious they must have been-- this is stuff that even kids wouldn't fall for today. Now imagine how the \"Game\" of lying evolved over hundreds of thousands of years. This should all make sense, that lying was a 'good strategy', but why would it be good for us to lie to *ourselves*? Isn't that counterproductive? The reason for it is, if you can convince *yourself* of a lie, you tell the best possible lie that can't be revealed through some microscopic social cues. Even after this is explained, the gravity of all the lies that saturate the planet earth just *don't* seem to register in our brains. This fact slips off the mind... like a droplet on the hydrophobic sloped surface of an umbrella.\n\nWe all suffer from this. We lie to ourselves. It doesn't benefit us to be honest about how horrible we all are. It's far more adaptive to be optimistic, which is why those who 'suffer' from the optimism bias tend find success in life. Even others *manifest* success in these people via the [pygmalion effect](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pygmalion_effect). Notice how none of this has anything to do with reality, it's just pure placebo, lies, and superficial expectations. Speaking of 'reality', to contrast this, we have [depressive realism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Depressive_realism), where if you're depressed, it turns out you probably just see reality as it is. It's what you'd expect with a psychopathic and psychotic species. There are no \"good guys\" like you're taught from childhood in fairy tales, or Disney, or superhero movies, or game of thrones, etc. It's just evil-- everywhere. That's the big plot twist of the movie of this world.\n\n&gt;I mean perhaps? I haven\u2019t completely given up on creating a world where friendship and love can exist.\n\nI have. The only thing that comes from evil monkeys playing such a powerful game of pretend that we can barely even discover our true nature. We're wired to behave in at least two general ways: 1) Be selfish domineering assholes that exploit and manipulate others in ways to perfect our own interests and strategically get a bigger piece of the pie 2) Be completely naive and tolerant of assholes exploiting us because we deeply, deeply wish this world has *something* good to offer. We'd rather be in bad company than be alone, because the ideas of 'alone' and 'life is always bad', terrify us deeply. If we can't do strategy 1, we'll do 2. Sometimes we'll switch it up. \n\n&gt;You can see that ethics is an aspect of reason, that there are ethical truths, and that\u2019s more than most already.\n\nSure, but the ethical truth I'm aware of is the worst case scenario-- evil wins by law. This is why all countries incentivize evil as their sociopolitical strategy. Why can't we let the elderly die in peace? Oh right, because it's *profitable* to squeeze out every dollar for as long as they live. Every time one seriously investigates reality with total openness and commitment to truth, they will not discover good news. That's the nature of that rabbit hole, unfortunately.\n\n&gt;You seem like you hurt, and you seem like you must be alone because you trust no one, so I\u2019m kinda concerned for you. \n\nEveryone hurts, deeply. They just can't realize it. And everyone is alone, even people surrounded constantly by 'friends' or in serious relationships. These people are even *more* alone than I am, that's the true tragedy. But the \"reality narrative\", the \"propaganda stream\", is that life is good. Lots of people are having a blast. Just check social media. Just visualize that person you're envious of. And if you *happen* to be poor, like most of the world, you'll have quite a few examples to look up to here. The less fortunate you are in the myriad of ways one can be less fortunate, this will be more and more clear. But the more fortunate you are, you'll simply be doomed to not understand. The *most* fortunate people, and those with 'winner' models on their brains(psychopaths, narcissists, sadists, pathological optimists) have the most to lose by admitting this is all a sham, and these are the people who determine the reality narrative, unfortunately. Just go back and watch the videos, and ask: \"Can I justify this?\" Now ask yourself what a huge success in life would answer. How strange, how easy it is to predict.

You don't choose which friends you meet, who hurts you, who you hurt, you don't choose what you're ignorant of, and you don't choose when something convinces you to stop being ignorant.\n\nThe idea of being in such a scenario where you're just a ragdoll being thrown around from causes you didn't author yourself, and being **blamed** is simply nonsense. Now, we can understand *why* the world blames people, and rewards people, and *why* people feel shame and pride, but this doesn't mean that it's **true** and logical to feel this way. This doesn't mean we shouldn't reward people(there are reasons to reward people even if they ultimately were just 'lucky', just to promote good things) and this doesn't mean we should not imprison say, serial killers(there are still reasons to isolate\/rehabilitate people who do harm to others, even if those people didn't ever choose to be the people they became), but to truly believe that people are *responsible*, and need to be punished because they could have done otherwise-- that is completely fictional, and causes immense human suffering.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568102231,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ezspidb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d2196d","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_d2196d","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/d2196d\/everything_is_in_our_control_our_upbringing\/ezspidb\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576590204,"score":30,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

For comparison, imagine describing mathematics in such a subjective language. We don't do this, because we take an objective approach to mathematics, and simply see math as a description of the behavior of numbers and quantities and so on. There is an unfortunate language game that goes here and says, \"Well you *can't* take an objective approach, because as long as you're talking and thinking you're a *subject* so **everything** you do and say is subjective. You can't *possibly* express objectivity.\" The problem here is that it ignores logic. You have to throw away basic logic to make this claim, and you do it, *with* the claim itself. \"You can't possibly say that a square is distinct from a circle and be objectively right\". Well, why? \"Because you're a flawed subjective thing.\" It's just a philosophical dead end, a kind of dialectic subversion, unfortunately. A kind of \"philosophy virus\" that masquerades as a good idea.\n\n\n We don't tell anyone, you *ought* to do math. We don't need to. It's obvious to do math(virus-sufferers will be skeptical here, just as they are skeptical that we ought to not take a cheese grater across our face for an hour, for no apparent reason). Even our closest genetic cousin today does extremely basic math, informally. If you met someone who said, \"I have no clue what math is\" you'd say, \"Oh well, it would benefit you to know.\" You don't say, emphatically, \"Good for you!\"\n\nEither way, that's tangential, because you don't *need* to convince people that they *ought* to do math. People do math to the degree they're comfortable, and you are either right or wrong in your math. If you met a cult that said, \"math is evil and or you're all wrong in your math\", and they weren't playing the same game of math, you'd just agree to disagree and say \"Okay great, well, we're off, to do math and computer science over *there*... seeya\"\n\nNow the same thing is true for ethics, with the crucial difference, that we struggle deeply to converge on ethical models. It's almost like everyone has a disagreement about what numbers and quantities are, I say 2=2, you say 2=3, and so  on. So we just can't get off the ground. This would all be explained in neurology and biology. Why is it that people can't converge on the reality of math? Once you figure that out, it's clear that you're in an objective reality where numbers really do have meaning, 2 really means 2, and it really is *less than* 3. A square *really* is distinct from a circle in ways that *everyone* can appreciate(if they can't, we explain that failure in the language of the science of brains and thought).\n\nThis is identical to the way morality is axiomatic, but our brains don't seamlessly agree on ethics as they do agree on math, for scientific reasons.\n\n'Morals' aren't a set of taught rules any more than 'Mathematics' is a set of taught rules, they are rules about the behavior of numbers like 2+2=4, that existed 4 billion years ago as they exist today, waiting to be discovered and converged on said truth, like ethics is waiting today.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568146841,"distinguished":null,"edited":1568147383,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":2},"id":"ezu7jot","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d2bvda","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_eztztnn","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/d2bvda\/contrary_to_many_philosophers_expectations_study\/ezu7jot\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576616193,"score":12,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":2}

The \"rules\" I'm describing here, to avoid confusion, are not rules like \"You ought not to steal\".

It is in your favor to completely forget the is-ought distinction, and deal only with *is*.\n\nMath deals *only* with is. Health deals *only* with is. There's no one telling you that you *ought* to do math or you *ought* to be healthy, **we don't need to do this**. Yet why would need to do this for ethics? This is the *wrong* approach, even if we *want* an ethical world, for the same reason we don't make ignoring math or health illegal. Yes, we want to *encourage* society to not be ignorant of mathematics, and ignorant of health, but these are completely objective fields, involving a set of descriptions about reality. Ethics is **identical**, ontologically. Any argument you have *against'* the objectivity of ethics, can be used to dismiss the objectivity of **anything**.\n\nAs for \"has it been discovered\", almost certainly not to any significant degree, my intuition says the world is largely unethical, in the same way we recoil at our ignorance of mathematics 10,000 years ago, our ignorance of health 10,000(It turns out soap is a good idea), we recoil at our historical ethical ignorance(slavery is a bad idea).

No one says you can't act or decide or choose. We're interested in the idea that you can do this **freely**. What does it mean, to do something **freely**? To do *anything* freely, you would have to be unconstrained by the causes and variables that influence this action without your knowledge, right? And it turns out that everything you do, again, **everything you do**, has causes and variables that influence this action **without** your knowledge, down to every thought, and movement, including all willful thoughts and movements(I distinguish consciousness here from what we call *sub-consciousness*-- simply saying \"I know why I do things\" is not convincing to anyone who is not naive to the field of psychology). Example:\n\n* **Visualize a rubber duck right now.**(If you cannot visualize this rubber duck, say the words \"rubber duck\" out loud)\n\nRead on once you've made a \"free\" choice here. Notice, no one is holding a gun to your head, you can either do this or not. Now, you could be *both* mute, **and** have the sort of brain that does not manifest imagery with eyes closed. So let's put aside everyone who falls into that specific category for the sake of this examination. You either did what was asked, or you didn't. If you did, you did it for specific reasons. Do you know those reasons? A person who is agreeable, is probably going to play along. A person who is highly disagreeable, and convinced of free will already, and is just thinking, \"This is dumb, there's no point to all of this.\" and moves on to a new post, is simply not going to participate. Are they free to behave this way? Did they control the circumstances that made them the sort of person who would behave this way? Of course not, that manifests itself from all the variables that make you, **you**.\n\nGenes, environment, parents, upbringing, peer groups, happenstance, neuroanatomy, and so on. You pick none of this. Rather, you are **thrown** into these conditions, and they cause and create feedback loops amongst themselves to cause even more things about you.

The way I interpret this sort of abuse, is something that can be called \"Therapy through biology\". I ask myself, \"What are the evolutionary benefits for a mother to say something that cruel to her child?\" It signals: \"The world is extremely cruel, a place where you *can* in fact get raped and killed. So now, I will force you to feel the deep negative emotions by simulating strong negativity towards you for the goal of shocking you into not being naive to the cruel world.\" This is the *only* way it can make sense from an immoral, cold, and unconscious perspective of biology, to be this awful to your child. Nature is simply awful, there's no beating around the bush. It produces parents which do awful things for some dumb, counter-intuitive survival benefit. \n\nThe narcissist here is really just a wild animal, a kind of robot, saying a horrible line, making you feel horrible. But the behavior has to be explainable through biology and psychology, these are the fields which *describe* the narcissist's actions.\n\nThis won't work for everyone of course, so if your way of coping is incompatible for whatever reason, please do what works for you. But for me, this re-frames the \"nasty person intentionally saying awful things for no good reason\" into more like a \"nastiness generator which intends to trigger adaptive strategies\". When I see her as a robot, or a dangerous animal, a lot of the negative emotions that tend to haunt you from abuse tend to go away. We don't say, \"That bear is *so* evil for attacking me in the wilderness, it deserves to be punished\", we say \"Yeah... it was unfortunate, and that's just what bears *do*.\"\n\nTelling their children horrible things is just what narcissists *do*. \n\nAgain, this in no way says \"What they do is okay\". What they do is **un**acceptable. But what's more unacceptable is for the victim to be eaten alive by the negative thoughts of hate and shame and all the traumas from gaslighting and abuse. When you see them as just a robot that reliably manufactures abuse, you can slowly free yourself from a lot of those wounds that seem as if they will never heal. It really is possible to heal them in a way that doesn't just wish them away, or bury them, or prove them wrong by succeeding in your own way-- you can make them blow away with the wind, never to be seen again.\n\nAnd congrats on your degree, this is an extremely important field because we have to understand ourselves first before we can ever make sense of anything.

I think a much better explanation for modern catastrophe memes are the utility of the apocalypse myth. The zeitgeist seems to *always* include some form of 'the end is nigh'. How *strange*. How *peculiar*. In the 90's, the Y2K virus was going to cause collapse. In the 2000's, the noble Mayans unmarred by our foolish materialism, psychedelic\/shamanic culture, and impressive knowledge of astronomy, figured out the date of the end. How useful is it for rulers to tell their peasants that this could *all* be over tomorrow? Well first of all, you're not exactly 'chill' and relaxed. You're anxious, and you generally have to do *something*. Doing something, is good for business. Depression is viable but only when you *know* things are bad, this is why it's also very profitable to keep people *happy* and *ignorant*.\n\nYour peasants can't just leave, so they're not really a liability that way. They have your language, culture, and so on. So they're stuck doing things in your kingdom. Great. Also, they're not saving up for tomorrow, because who knows if we're even going to wake up. May as well *consume*. Pretty good for business.\n\nOf course, this is just viable in peaceful times. Times of war require a completely different strategy, and apocalypse memes aren't needed because a genuine threat is clearly before you, you must conserve and ration and fight and keep morale high and all that jazz. But the moment war is over, you don't actually get to relax, because now it's back to apocalypse memes.\n\nThe modern apocalypse meme in 2019 is \"We fucked nature up\/we're directly and indirectly altering the environment and weather to catastrophic results\", which just so happens to also be true. If the physical reality of the apocalypse meme doesn't exist, it could be necessary(or at least useful) to invent it.

This gets drummed into us from childhood, where we are shamed, and blamed, and punished, and rewarded. We're told we deserve things, or we don't deserve them. Our entire legal system is structured on this idea, too. Criminals are locked up not simply to protect society, they're locked up as *punishment*. Does this make sense? Is moral responsibility possible? I don't think so. Here is a philosopher named [Galen Strawson](https:\/\/philosophy.as.uky.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/The%20Impossibility%20of%20Moral%20Responsibility%20-%20Galen%20Strawson.pdf) restating the Basic Argument for the impossibility of moral responsibility:\n\n* \"You do what you do, in any given situation you find yourself, because of the way you **are**\".\n* \"To be truly morally responsible for what you do, you *must* be responsible for the way you **are** -- at least in certain crucial *mental* respects.\"\n* \"You cannot be *truly* responsible for the way you **are**, because to be *truly* responsible for the way you **are**, you must have intentionally brought about the way you **are**, and that is **impossible**.\"\n\nThere's more to it than that in the link, but that is the gist. You don't choose to be born, first of all. You don't choose your parents, your geography, your genes, what *time* you were born(the year 1700 , or 2000-- why are you born *at the moment you were born* rather than in the future or past? It's totally mysterious and outside of your control). You don't choose your life experiences. You don't choose which friends you meet, who hurts you, who you hurt, you don't choose what you're ignorant of, and you don't choose when something convinces you to stop being ignorant.\n\nThe idea of being in such a scenario where you're just a ragdoll being thrown around from causes you didn't author yourself, and being **blamed** is simply nonsense. Now, we can understand *why* the world blames people, and rewards people, and *why* people feel shame and pride, but this doesn't mean that it's **true** and logical to feel this way. **This doesn't mean we shouldn't reward people**(incentives for good actions are still good) and **this doesn't mean people doing bad things are somehow okay** and this doesn't mean we should, say, stop imprisoning serial killers(there are still reasons to isolate\/rehabilitate people who do harm to others, even if those people didn't ever choose to be the people they became), but to truly believe that people are *responsible*, and need to be punished because they could have done otherwise-- that is completely fictional, and causes immense human suffering.\n\nIn your case, OP, it makes sense to feel bad that you did a bad thing(assuming you *did* a bad thing here, I am not in a position to tell you that you did something bad), but it doesn't make sense to beat yourself up for it and never forgive yourself. You could not have done otherwise, because to do otherwise, would be impossible. You didn't create the circumstances which caused you to make a mistake. You didn't cause your neurons to fire, or your legs to move one way versus another. If you move your arm right now, the fact that you move it for 5 seconds vs. 10 is completely mysterious. A different person than you would move it for 20. An even more different person would say \"This is stupid, I'm not moving my arm.\" Are you responsible for the fact that you **are not** these sorts of people? Of course not. You're just **you**. You could only have done whatever you did, and learn from mistakes you notice to not make them in the future.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568239704,"distinguished":null,"edited":1568240100,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ezxg8q1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d2wqyu","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_d2wqyu","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/d2wqyu\/how_do_you_learn_to_forgive_yourself\/ezxg8q1\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576674956,"score":7,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Physics says time is basically a dimension, like the 3 dimensions of space. It's not a thing that flows or moves, it's just there, and our subjective experience gives us the illusion that it's passing, but time does not really 'flow'. Physics suggests that the past is real, the present is real, and the future is real. The past doesn't disappear somewhere and no long exists, like it *feels* to us. It exists, we just only perceive a \"movement\" or \"passage\". Time can't be lost any more than height can be lost. I know this is still *useful* to describe the ways we move through reality and play our silly little human games like \"I saved time\", but at the same time it can be said that it confuses us even more.\n\nThis is an analogy that I thought up, so it may help you, but maybe not. Anyway, here goes...\n\nImagine being a tiny living thing on the surface of a flower petal. The petal is so big *to you* that it's all you see in all directions. You don't know what a \"petal\" is even, let alone a flower. It's just an endless landscape of this petal surface. This flower represents our universe.\n\nTime, for you, would go by slowly in relation to how we see the petal. Imagine one of those videos of a flower transitioning from a tight flower bud, to a fully bloomed flower, but *super* sped up to show the process of blooming in 1-2 seconds. That represents the big bang-&gt;the distant future. That sped-upness, is what we'd see if we could look at the universe **as** a tiny flower bud. The flower is *already* bloomed. We're just these tiny things on the petal, seeing it happening ssuuuuuuuuppeeeeeerrrrrrrr slllllloooooowwwwwwwwwllllllllyyyyyyyyyyyy. If we could have a god's eye view right now, we'd see everything happen *super* fast like a sped up flower blooming. According to what most physicists believe, the future is already \"bloomed\", but the experience of time is just us feeling as if we're moving through the 'frames' of the block universe. The prior frames and posterior frames exist just as much as the 'now' frame.\n\nHopefully this didn't waste anyone's *time*.(unless you're at work)","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568267753,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ezygnx6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d2xinw","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_d2xinw","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/d2xinw\/had_a_real_depressing_moment_when_my_thoughts\/ezygnx6\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576692314,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

If anything is evil, it's psychopathy-- the perfect phenotype for \"winning\" in our reality-- domination, callousness, self-absorption(these are the truly evil elements), and they are *obscured* and *camouflaged* by: manipulation, deception, charm.\n\nAdolf Hitler roused entire crowds to fervently believe in him. Ted Bundy kept his arm in a sling, pretending to be injured, and proceeded to kidnap, kill, and rape countless women. Ted Bundy convinced even the Judge in the courtroom to give him sympathy. This wouldn't work if Ted Bundy looked like the Night King, then he'd just be some goofy figure and everyone would have an effortless time, and say \"Nope! You're evil, case closed!\". \n\nAll of our myths and stories provide shelter, shade, and camouflage by depicting a false image of evil.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568274051,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ezysw2u","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d2t4mk","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_d2t4mk","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/d2t4mk\/societies_choose_to_make_evil_look_sexy_in_order\/ezysw2u\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576698235,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

A group that doesn't even *exist* in the same way our group does. To understand this, put yourself in the position of a natalist in a world where having children is presumably unethical. Imagine there is some ethical transgression you're committing **right** now. Something really terrible. Let's just call it X to be vague. People who engage with X are Xers. And since you engage in X and have zero understanding of the ethics of X, you **are** an Xer as of this day. You actually think X is **great**, and look forward to doing X. While X may have extremely strong **positive** associations in your mind, to some people, X is horrible, and if they are correct, you just can't account for the fact that you are simply ignorant right now. But you don't even *know* that you're an Xer! Not in a *meaningful* way, a way that catalogues why X'ing is deeply wrong to do. It's just an *activity* that you take the ethics of for granted.\n\nNow, imagine some group you never heard of, is constantly rattling on about how evil and terrible and stupid Xer's are. You realize, \"Hey, wait a second. That's **me**. **I** am an Xer!\"\n\nWhat is your first impression? What do you think about these people who are deeply angry at and condescending towards you? Given what you know about human psychology, are you likely to say here, \"Wow... what an idiot I've been, these people have every right to hate me.\" and drop your X'ing sympathies immediately? Of course not. Humans simply don't change their minds this way. We dislike people who dislike us. We dislike ideas contrary to ours. We're tribal and have strong beliefs that don't get changed, and this has strong evolutionary explanation.\n\nSo let's ask ourselves, who are we helping by constantly using 'natalist' as a pejorative? If we're angry, that's obviously understandable to everyone. We should express our anger. But express it at the horror of the world. Everyone gets angry sometimes and says something aimed at people who reproduce, even that is understandable in small doses. But by falling into the pattern of being perpetually angry at *people* rather than ideas, we hurt the ethical position of antinatalism, because we just seem hostile at people who largely haven't even been given a chance to be exposed to the ideas and are just like we were prior to realizing the ethics.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568315504,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f01ju5k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d2n59b","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_d2n59b","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/d2n59b\/were_proadoption\/f01ju5k\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576746119,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I have a gut feeling that just about everything is to some degree potentially wrong. The only exception is the proposition: \"I am conscious\", which I think is the only truly self-evident starting position. Another starting proposition is \"We need a language game to make sense of the world. Without a language game you can't acknowledge the only undeniable fact of existence: That the lights are on. \"*Stuff* is happening, to whatever degree you want to define \"stuff\" and \"happening\".\"\n\nIf you want to define 'stuff' and 'happening' as \"just the illusory shifting of colors and sensations in this field of consciousness that exists only subjectively but is entirely fictional and meaningless\", that's fine. Stuff is still happening and changing in that context. If you want to define it as \"I am moving through a real physical world\", that's fine too.\n\nOnce you arrive there, you know there must be some *contrast* in principle between stuffs and happenings. You must be able to move further away or towards stuff, both in proximity through experience, and in the the **description** of such things. The same is true for happenings.\n\nThis already opens the door for mathematics, because it introduces quantity. How *much* stuff? How *long* is it happening? We have language, we have math. As long as we have this, we have ethics. Ethics describe the changes and interactions between conscious things, the same way math describes the changes and interactions between number things.\n\nWe can then describe the *quality* of this conscious experience, and conclude things are generally bad for this conscious state. We can ask why things are bad, and discover other properties of this universe, natural selection and systems which reproduce seems to set the environment for meaningful suffering-- being eaten alive, rape, being ostracized by your society, being traumatized by hallucinations due to the happenstance of mental illness, etc. We don't even need to notice this, however. We can just acknowledge the potential for such things that are better off not existing, acknowledge that any conscious thing who can appreciate them would be in a needlessly terrible state, and say creating such states is unnecessary.\n\nThis is all you need for antinatalism. And if you're arguing *for* creation of life, the burden is on you to say \"It is *necessary* to bring about beings which can(and certainly will) suffer.\" As long as you can make this argument and support it rationally in a way that tosses aside these concerns for conscious suffering, you've convinced me to drop antinatalism. \n\nThat being said, antinatalism can be counter-intuitive. What if we mathematically learned that you make *more* antinatalists, by having children? What if we could simulate clones of this reality, side by side, and in one, everyone alive now is an antinatalist. The movement sputters off and dies between points a points b, or remains constant, at say... 10% of the population. The population still explodes, and in 1,000 years the total sum of living humans or supersentient post-human things living on or near Earth, is 1 trillion.\n\nIn the other experimental group, everyone who is an antinatalist today produces a child. Antinatalism explodes due to the memetics + genetics, and stabilizes at 33% of the population henceforth. The population of earth still explodes, and in 1,000 years the total sum of living humans is 800 billion. That's 200 billion lives saved by antinatalists *becoming* natalists. This is the sort of thing we as apes who evolved on the plains of the Savannah are plainly terrible at grasping. We suffer from scope insensitivity, we can't see how our actions have repercussions towards the future. Is this experiment correct? Who knows, but we must follow where ever the data and ethics lead, not where the dogma leads. The goal isn't to \"not have children\", the goal is to **prevent beings from coming into this existence**.

Letting go:\n\n* Does not make it okay\n* Does not mean forgetting\n* Does not mean the abuser is off the hook\n* Does not mean you're friends now\n\nAll it means is, we have fully faced the gravity of what happened. Instead of hiding it, burying it, denying it, channeling it into rage that devours us for life, we acknowledge it. \"It **happened**. It was **wrong**.\" The abuse at the hands of a narcissist or psychopath is very much like being attacked by a wild animal, in the wilderness. Being attacked by a wild animal can induce trauma. Maybe we're afraid of the wilderness now. Maybe we get nightmares. Maybe we're angry that we have some scars now. The damage of the attack could have been so severe that our life was permanently forced in one of the *last* directions we could have wanted. Maybe we even blame the bear or whatever it was, and tell ourselves things like \"I hope that bear *fucking* suffers.\"\n\nBut that bear? It is just **being** a bear. True or not? Yes, they did a terrible thing, but we can move through life in a way that *isn't* eaten alive by what happened, or simply acknowledge that the bear is just a human-hurting robot in a scenario like the one where we were in. That is **all** a narcissist is when you calmly think about it, a human-hurting robot. They are extremely unlucky, like the bear. Imagine what it means for the bear to be *truly* lucky, as a conscious being. If the bear was *really* lucky, they could understand your language, and also understand the concept of \"do unto others\". But they can do neither. A narcissist, by comparison, also has a deficiency in understanding here because they have the *brain* of a narcissist. That's what it **means** to have NPD. NPD isn't a magic choice someone makes, it's an error in the brain and some kind of unfortunate life that turns them into a monster. They are unlucky, like the bear, doomed to hurt people. Does this mean we have to be friends with bears or pretend viscous mailings are okay? Of course not. It takes *nothing* away from the horrible nature of the harm done, to say \"this happened, and is unfortunate\". If anything, it *gives* you something back. It frees you from the negative associations that only serve to harm you and haunt you. *That* is what letting go is.\n\nYour abusers don't \"win\" if you stop being haunted by the trauma, they don't even care about \"winning\", they've already lost in the most meaningful possible sense because they're narcissists and will never understand how their brains cause human misery(and animal misery, as some of us unfortunately know firsthand), they're just being robots.

Imagine you're unlucky enough to be someone like [Junko Furuta](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Junko_Furuta) who was raped and tortured for over a month before being murdered, was held in captivity, with 100~ people complicit in understanding of the crime, who did nothing about it or participated in the torture. Or [Elisabeth Fritzl](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fritzl_case) who was imprisoned in a soundproof basement dundgeon for 24 years by her father, sexually abused by her father at age 11 and imprisoned at age 18, and raped her countless times for 24 years, where she was forced to bear seven children, one of which died, 3 of which were removed from the chamber and raised by Elisabeth's parents. The other 3 children were imprisoned with Elisabeth, who probably had to watch as their mother was raped by their grandfather, among other forms of abuse, again, for 24 years.\n\nJust imagine what would happen in these kinds of experiences, at the absolute rock bottom moment, if it could be brought to your attention that life is wonderful for someone, somewhere. You're mid-torture, and someone shows you a tablet containing footage of a happy family, frolicking, having some sublime and ecstatic and deeply meaningful moment, as has been largely the  case for most of their lives. First note that this perfect family seems completely fictional in a way that the torture victims who are very real, do not. But let's imagine they are real. What would change if these people were shown footage that displayed the gravity of the worst situations? It would undoubtedly cause the deeply positive experience to take a nosedive, barring the presence of psychopathy or mania or some other anti-social pathology. Anyone we could call \"mentally healthy\" would immediately be mortified. They would feel sick to their stomach, and probably even traumatized. It would be like waking up from a good dream, into a nightmare.\n\nBut let us revisit what happens when you do the reverse. What happens when you show someone in the worst experience the fact that there are some happy people having ecstatic blissful lives that only get better and better? Would this offer even a little bit of respite when you're under the torturer's instruments? I don't think so, and paradoxically, this could even make the suffering worse. But it certainly wouldn't be relieving. It wouldn't jar you from the intense agony. It wouldn't add any kind of silver lining or cause the beginnings of a smile to curl up.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, the worst misery makes a mockery of the greatest bliss in a way that the greatest bliss never excuses the worst misery.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568356818,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f03j2aq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d3f7j1","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_d3f7j1","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/d3f7j1\/my_thoughts_this_evening_id_really_appreciate\/f03j2aq\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576780357,"score":4,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

It makes the anti-suicide person seem irrational, and they are. What explains this irresistible need to stop people from dying? In the broadest sense, death makes us uncomfortable. DNA gives us the incentive to want to pretend death doesn't even exist, and we do this successfully for most of our lives. As a result, we fail to appreciate what matters most, because we're too self-absorbed, regretting the past, worrying about the future-- we miss out on what matters in the present. I'm not sure if other animals besides humans understand death, but humans clearly seem to. Yet at the same time, they sweep this knowledge under the rug.\n\nKnowledge of death creates existential anxiety, because the same mechanism which drives us(ego, driven by DNA), does not want to die. It wants to live, to consume, to mate, and just \"do things\", because that's what apes are wired to do, since \"doing things\" is better for the DNA than sitting around in a paralysis doing nothing(quite unsexy, for this reason).\n\nThen there is the cultural and social level.

The ways in which the money maximizing machine converges with exploiting the individual here are fundamental, because the very first step to exploitation is forcing everyone who is so miserable they beg for death, a denial of this very basic right.\n\nThe incentives here are plain: Pharmaceuticals like antidepressants simply aren't profitable if people are allowed to die. The drugs are intended to prevent death, so they maximize profit in two ways, causing a feedback loop for profit. They prevent the death of the consumer, and then this allows the consumer to consume more of the product, which prevents their death, which allows for yet more consumption. **Crucially, they allow you to wake up, get out of bed in the morning, and work conditions which you would otherwise consider to be unbearable, without the presence of many of these drugs.**(and many times, even with their presence-- you can only sprinkle so much glitter on a turd) This class of drugs have a kind of \"meta-profit\" for all other industries, because as a CEO of a major corporation, you inadvertently benefit from your depressed ground floor being on drugs whether you're in the pharmaceuticals business or not.\n\nJust imagine this with any other destructive industry based on killing the consumer for profits: Imagine if eating Big Macs and milkshakes at MacDonald's actually *lowered* your chances of dying from a heart attack or diabetes. Imagine if you had to \"give the Big Macs a chance\" for a few months, before they started working. Imagine if McDonalds told everyone it was imperative to not die, no matter what, because life is precious or people who want to die in a mentally ill system are somehow psychologically impaired. \n\nThis is our situation with Big Pharma.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568499633,"distinguished":null,"edited":1568500094,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f09esj0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d474kb","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_d474kb","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/d474kb\/nooo_dont_kill_yourself_youre_too_valuable_to_the\/f09esj0\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576882019,"score":9,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Unlike someone like Sam Harris who believes that \"Science will answer moral questions\", I think this is the wrong approach. I think science first has to answer *why* human beings hold the ethical positions they hold. This is the key forward to understanding ethics. I predict that if you look at a nihilist or anti-realist, you will find higher anti-social personality features, a lack of empathy, egocentrism, and so on. This is perfectly testable *right now*, with our current tools. It would be very hard to do, of course, but it's possible. Once we understand that personality *determines* your ethical positions, we can move forward in ethics.\n\nScience can potentially answer a lot of interesting questions here. What makes one a monist and what makes one a dualist, neurologically and psychologically? How does the presence of depersonalization, derealization, and dissociation correlate with ethical positions?\n\nBut anyway, as far as I see, truth is objective, and there are ethical truths, so yes, if I'm right that bringing beings into existence is really unethical, then it would be as true to say as 2+2=4 is true to say.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568524841,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f0bbfu0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d4ftk0","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_d4ftk0","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/d4ftk0\/honest_question_to_antinatalists\/f0bbfu0\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576915074,"score":5,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I think any effort to perform a 'revolution' of some kind, would by definition be co-opted and manipulated by the most powerful bad actors, since I think evil inherently beats good in this universe(natural selection+entropy, the bad guy wins, it's easier to break something than to fix it). When you consider the scope of power being distilled, you not only stand before a behemoth today, but a behemoth so strong that every good move you attempt to make, it will be spun to do more evil than your good move.\n\nThis is what an intelligence agency, a media superpower, etc is capable of. Even someone like a movie or music star with an audience to the scale of 7 or 8 figures, simply stands no chance. \n\nNotice how this deeply negative, deeply disappointing, and deeply pessimistic message is exactly *contrary* to everything you've been taught since childhoold, through books, hollywood movies, stories, myths, etc.\n\nI have another theory that these stories ultimately benefit the partly conscious, partly unconscious evil which dominates reality.

The struggle against evil may be hard, but in the end, it is good that **always** wins.\n\nBut this is the exact opposite of what occurs in our reality.

There is no room for good to win in a universe governed by natural selection and entropy. It's mathematically impossible. For good to win, it would need to exhibit the same evil \"win at all costs\" attitude that evil exhibits, and train this mode of being by *being* evil. Good must follow rules. It's hard to be good. It means not doing the easy, wrong thing. It means not lying like a manipulative psychopath when you can get away with it. Evil has no rules. The only rule for evil, is win.

I think these words really do have meaning, just like hot and cold have meaning. Yes, they are not a binary, there is no \"hot **or** cold\", there's hotter, and there is colder. *This* seemingly arbitrary nature shouldn't be confused with the objective truths of temperature variance. The sun is **objectively** hotter than the surface of the planet neptune. The actions of John Wayne Gacy are *objectively* more evil than a buddhist monk who teaches metta meditation. Once you grant that *this* is objectively true(it requires a real philosophical stubbornness to *not* grant this, since it's so obviously true, just like the objective property of temperature), then you can grant that these differences must exist *everywhere*. \n\nAnd this is perfectly intuitive. Just imagine a person who took 1 trillion people onto a planet, kept them alive indefinitely, and tortured them perfectly using technology that hasn't even been invented yet. Perhaps this is so abstract and detached that one struggles to understand how horrible this scenario would be, so if that's the case, just imagine a human being who created a hell of infinite suffering for a lot of people that would make the worst sadists in Earth's history look like saints.\n\nThis person would be objectively the most evil thing we've ever seen. He's dealing with real people, just like you, and lots of children, adults, all kinds of people-- and perfectly torturing them all. It would not be 'arbitrary' to call this person the most evil thing in the known universe. To call that arbitrary, you'd have to call a project on an equal scale, that does the exact opposite, like say, imagine a benevolent alien species descends on Earth tomorrow, a species that somehow tricked evolution through some quirk to not descend into competition and war, and instead exploited a love for science and ethics as some sort of ultimate adaptation. In this alien species, for thousands of years, they mated *purely* on the basis of who had more genuine desire to respect sentient creatures, create technology for benevolent purposes, and promote goodness towards every living thing that can suffer. First notice how completely fictional this seems when compared to our warmongering psychopathic species. But still, just imagine this happened. They would be more advanced than us, so this species told us they would cure us of all the nasty human traits that evolved in us for millions of years. All of Earth's interspecies problems would be solved. You'd see people just vomiting on the streets after waking up to [what we do to animals](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3315). That sort of thing. This species would be one of the *best* things that could possibly happen to Earth. **Objectively**, as a description of what it means to be conscious, and to describe what sorts of values conscious things objectively and logically value.\n\nNow compare these aliens, to the imaginary torturer. To say good and evil are arbitrary is to say there is *no* ethical difference between the actions of those enacting these scenarios. The aliens aren't *really* 'better' than the sadist torturer. This is really pointlessly dishonest, I think, and a symptom of being extremely stubborn in admitting that descriptions of bad and good simply must be objective like descriptions of *anything* else in the universe. These are not mysterious concepts, but people who refuse to put their face in the fire or forget what this is like, tend to be pretty done-deaf in regards to this topic. But always, once the face approaches fire, the objective nature of how horrible suffering is begins to intrude as the ego is threatened with death.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568582883,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f0fg8t5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d4oymx","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_f0fdqb8","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/d4oymx\/i_have_a_theory_about_people_on_this_sub\/f0fg8t5\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1576987118,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Stoicism seems to just say \"be like a rock and face this shit world\".\n\nThe Buddhists on the other hand were obsessed with the problem of suffering also and seemed to discover a technique that really works for everyone if done correctly, religious or not. It recognizes that all of this is just story-telling bullshit. This whole \"me me me\", this whole \"self\" thing, this whole \"I'm hungry, I'm horny, I'm bored, I'm scared\", this is all just a fabrication of a mind with an ego, and that being *absorbed* by these thoughts is how we suffer. They train attention to separate the experience, from the thinker, and in doing so, they discover there is no thinker-- just experience. \n\nIf you've reached your limit before mental breakdown, giving mindfulness meditation a serious try(like, 2 months every day at least) is probably worth it. All it is, is chipping away that at self-absorbed egomaniacal self. It's hard to kill that thing, but it can be seen as a vector of your suffering, and the suffering of those around you, and injuring it really does seem to lower the subjective experience of suffering(by lowering the subject itself). You do it by:\n\n* Sitting down\n* Taking some deep breaths until you're fully relaxed and notice a real difference from then-and-now in terms of relaxation. Take your time to settle in, and start to breathe normally.\n* Watch the sensation of your entire respiratory system, from beginning to end. This is the foundation of the exercise.\n* Notice whatever you notice. Is it hard to pay attention? Getting distracted? Go back to watching the breath. When you first get settled, you may start to notice something like, \"Wow, my jaw is really clenched.\" or a thought like \"I'm annoyed that I need to constantly shift to get comfortable here\"\n\nAll of that is *just* the noise of the mind. Don't react to it, but just notice how it captivates you and hypnotizes you, it feels like that **is** you. But that isn't you. How could it be? You're just *watching* it. All the exercise is is just non-judgemental attention towards the breath. You don't need to force anything(In fact, if you're trying really hard to force something, that is just *another* thing for you to notice)\n\nEdit: To be clear, I have no special sympathy towards Buddhism itself, at my most rational efforts I realize this is just another system for \"winning\" reality as apes tend to(just like politics, other religions, cultures, etc). It just so happens they discovered a little non-zero sum trick that lets you break out of the cycle of thinking and see the world more clearly. Maybe through seeing the world clearly, one would even discover everything Buddhists have said is bullshit. Who knows. The fact is though, this is so different from what every other religion has done, which has mostly been a dogmatic model. Buddhism gives you this like... \"Thinking power\" because it, intentionally or unintentionally, advocates a technique that ultimately will detach you from all the little bullshit monkey biases operating in our minds. You can't experience the state of \"no self\" and just be a horny, tribal, opinionated, self-absorbed moron, like all of us tend to be just by being human beings. Buddhism \"won\" the \"race\" here by coming up and advocating a technique that *kills* that state of mind.

It's sort of like living in a strange, absurdist world where a byproduct of being a selfish asshole and liar caused disembodied hands wielding kitchen knives to materialize randomly and stab people, and some subset of the population in this hypothetical world were coming into clinics and hospitals(Or just sitting at home, bleeding, bandaging wounds, refusing treatment), with stab wounds, and we called this occurrence \"stab-prone disorder\".\n\nWhen people would speak to doctors, they'd say things like, \"No no no, you don't get it, it's crazy out there, you see, knives literally come out of the air and **stab** you...\" a doctor would condescendingly tell you that it's actually you, *you* have this disorder(with superficial kindness, of course). At first, bandage companies and purveyors of coagulant medication would come up with a stab-susceptibility theory. Some people *simply* have a deficiency in stab-resistance, and they have the cure for not getting stabbed so much.\n\nLater on, it would turn out this theory is complete bullshit. More and more people would discover that it's simply the fact that life is hell, in general, not that people are stab-prone. Upon further investigation, one could realize that it is not that the bandage and stab-resistance industries are stupid and don't understand, but they actually profit from ignorance on this subject. It turns out that this level of deception and manipulation and exploitation is rampant across humanity, and it also turns out that the hands materializing knives is just a feature, not a bug, resulting from an ancient gladiator war between civilizations and species and groups.\n\nThat's how absurd \"depression\" is as it is seen as a medical condition today. Notice how different it would be if our world actually tracked reality. Notice how much sympathy we'd have for depressed people if we acknowledged that this entire project is perverse. You'd actually *feel* the kindness all around you, and the camaraderie whenever you entered a hospital. You'd feel it from the pharmaceutical industry. These people would *know* they're heroes, and you'd know it to. Human social sense is really good, we've been evolving that for millions of years now from our social ancestors. \n\nYet, this isn't the case. Every signal tells us the world is a depraved psychopathic hellscape of exploitation, if we examine things very closely and break out of all the propaganda we've been force fed from birth.

If we just drop all of our assumptions about politics, about history, about reality, and **only** observe the facts, we know that we live in a universe that involves these self-replicating machines. This has been the case for several billion years, and machines with brains have existed for millions of years. Somewhere in the last several hundred thousand, we began to gain strong enough self-awareness that we could identify patterns like \"we are going to die\" or \"this thing doesn't like it when I hurt it\". The game simply became more complicated, but the game did not change. That game, as it has always been, has been a game with no referee. True of false?

It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone.\n\n-- Robin Williams\n\nI think anger, resentment, sadness, these are all normal and rational emotions once you find yourself in the situation where you discover how superficial and phony most human relations tend to be. We exploit each other for attention, conversational bandwidth, emotional fulfillment, sex, material gain, etc. This is the 'dark truth' they will not teach you in school. This is what only a harsh life teaches. Those not living a harsh life, will be absorbed in the mutual delusion. Of course my friends love me! But do they? What would happen, if you became homeless? If you contracted a terrible, incurable disease that made you wither away, and stole your energy? Would they visit you as much as before? Or would they magically, tragically, just have less time for you?\n\nOld age is extremely similar to such a mysterious illness, where you wither away and change. And how do we treat our elderly? We forget them, stuff them into homes, stuff them into rooms, and 'enjoy' our lives. How we treat the elderly says a lot about ourselves, and reveals some very uncomfortable truths about how self-absorbed and deceptive we really are.\n\nOnce you get past the feeling of betrayal of losing your last friends, you may be fortunate enough to discover Robin Williams' wisdom-- it really isn't so bad to be friendless. Most human beings are bad company. This isn't a egotistical position, it's not that *I'm* uniquely great and no one wants to be around me and it \"sucks for them\" or \"they're missing out\", --nope, none of that. I'm just as bad. I'm just as selfish. And it disgusts me, because I'm honest about how deeply flawed the incentives for exploiting social situations are in all of us. And I won't subject people to any kind of close relationship with me, and I expect the same. It's simply better than being caught up in a fairy tell where you set yourself up to be disappointed because you believe your best friend will actually give you their kidney, but when it comes time to it, \"uhhh err... well you see, things are so complicated...\" the excuses will just roll in, 9 times out of 10. And when reality hits people in the face, they just can't believe it. They can't believe they lived a lie *that* long. Which is what it is-- it's just a very comforting lie, one of many we tell ourselves to cope with a deeply dark reality. It may be the most depressing thing you've read all month, but I'd rather be depressed and honest than happy and deluded.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568618131,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f0hc967","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d4x1kw","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_d4x1kw","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/d4x1kw\/anger_and_resentment\/f0hc967\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1577019697,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

The first thing is that natural selection and evolution govern *everything*, again **everything**.\n\nThey not only govern the biological state of the world today, the fact that humans and not whales rule our planet, but the very basis of 'natural selection' governs which ideas thrive and which ideas die. That which goes forward, basically doesn't necessarily go forward because it's \"good\" or \"true\", it goes forward because it arbitrarily(this is a word that means determined by whims or chance rather than reason or sense) \"wins\" according to an almost circular logic. Why did it win? It won because it was the best. Best in what way? Was it the most noble? Ethical? True, at least? No, it was the most powerful, convincing, useful(with regards to winning), and so on. You're taught when you're young, watching cartoons, watching movies, that \"the good guys beat the bad guys\" in just about everything you see, but this is not how the world works-- this is a fantasy representation of nature.\n\nThis is how reality at the human and animal level functions. We are the product of machines that as far as we know, occurred by sheer chance, and these machines just keep making more copies. Not because making more copies is good, not because of *anything*, just because of an intrinsic property of *replication*. And by replicating, these machines changed a little bit. When they changed, they were either better, inconsequential, or worse in the \"game\" of competing against other machines and making more machines. These features and the happenstance of physics, is what determined which machines went forward. This is still true today.

Granted, it's worse with STP, but it's sort of misleading because there are other people who are effectively harmless but get profiled and judged harshly. You don't need STP to have some overactive pattern detection, it's simply *inside* us as humans. A big cofusion they tell everyone is that these \"disorders\" are binary, you either have them, or you don't. But in reality, this makes no sense. After understanding how the brain works, and how psychology works, there is no \"on\/off\" switch\/network of this kind. It has to be a gradient, or a spectrum.\n\n**Everyone** is a little bit Schizotypal, schizophrenic, etc. Some to an extremely mild degree that isn't noticeable. Everyone sees patterns, and often these patterns that aren't there, cuz we **evolved** this kind of accidental 'error' to survive. We saw the tall grass of the Savannah rustle millions of years ago, and if we simply associated no pattern but only looked at details and said \"Oh look, the grass is rustling, I won't form a conclusion, I'll just investigate\"(Of course, no one spoke this way, I'm just describing the *spirit* of the behavior), this person died if they discovered a tiger in the grass. But if this person assumed it was a tiger, and was constantly paranoid about tigers, even when it was just the wind, this was an **adaptive** behavior. It actually promoted survival, because you didn't die when it **really** was a tiger. Even if you invented some extremely fantastical crazy pattern like \"It's the evil wind god!\", it *still* protected you the times where it was really a predator, even if the wind god wasn't real. And behaviors that were promoted for survival, got to mate, and pass on, and stood the test of time. This is why **everyone** alive today is paranoid to one degree or another.\n\nWe're not terribly different now as we were then. We see someone, we see a pattern. We call it \"suspicious\". Is it really suspicious? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. We form bad conclusions about people, because they're safe conclusions, or evolutionarily *strategic* conclusions, not because they're necessarily correct.\n\nHopefully this tangent helps some STP's see themselves not as someone carrying some \"disorder\" but simply having a \"strategy\" in their brain that sometimes misfires in today's world(and sometimes doesn't!).

In biology, we see these parasitic insects that hypnotize shit, inject eggs into things, have specific venoms to keep shit alive so the young that bursts out gets fresh meat to dine on, we see it in the malicious bird species that destroy eggs of other species and lay their own, tricking the nesting bird to raise theirs(the baby even kills its \"sibligns\"), we see it in the simple domination of predators and herbivores, we see it in the domination hierarchy of our own society(even in \"cooperative\" systems like corporations, governments, or just your group of your own friends). A lot of these things are very hard to see, because human social systems involve very heavy layers of manipulation and deception. Some of us don't want to believe this dark truth, but it's a little easier to look at others who we aren't attached to and see just how effortlessly people lie to and exploit each other. Everything is really just a massive exploitation, deception, and domination game.\n\nWhen we just forget *everything* we think we know, and step outside and look at the world before us, we'll see a world that seems to have been built by cooperation at first, and this is true, to a superficial degree given what exists under the surface of all of this. But if we really consider the current state of things, and the state of how things have always been in human hierarchy, it will become more and more clear that exploitation and power has been the name of the game for thousands of years.

Other people see things like capybaras raising each other's children.\n\nTo not grant that nature is on the whole, brutal and anxiety filled and an utter bloodbath, would be extremely naive or dishonest. Just about every biologist grants this fact, but doesn't extrapolate it to a final conclusion that life is indeed hell, for, ironically, evolutionary reasons(optimism and ignorance are survival mechanisms in a hellworld).\n\n&gt;I don't, and I feel bad for your friends if they do.\n\nWell, like I said, many people are deeply delusional here. You're either predator or prey, whether you know it or like it. I won't piss in your cornflakes any further than that. \n\n&gt;You need more evidence to graduate from \"some people and animals do this\" to \"this is the nature of everything\".\n\nThere's no single piece of evidence for this, just a long and sober analysis of life. If you have sunk-costs into this life project, you'll be unable to see it, in a way that is asymmetrical to someone who does not have sunk costs, because if life is hell, optimistic people are delusional and depressives are simply realists. And I'm claiming that life is hell, so we're kind of at an impasse here.\n\n&gt;Cooperation was the name for millions of years. It's still the name in most of the undercurrent of society, beneath the grafted-on hyper-marketization. Your friends don't charge you to come over for dinner, presumably.\n\nI've already granted that it was, but this is superficial. Domination has been the name of the game, and domination exists covertly in cooperation. The real winner is the dominator, not the cooperator. The genes of a cow kept alive in [cow hell](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3315) may be winning since they are being proliferated, but the cow is losing. If genes could talk and play social games of bullshit and lies, they could appear to be cooperating with farmers:\n\nCow genes: \"Hey farmer! How's it going buddy!\"\n\n\nFarmer: \"Hey genes, long time! Say, we need to cooperate to keep this business going, ya feel? How's about we make sure you help us, by just doing your thing, and we, we'll make sure to increase cow generations, deal?\"\n\n\nCow genes: \"You bet, Mr. Farmer!\"\n\nNow, this is how our human-human cooperation works, and a naive look at this would make things appear cooperative. We'd see the farm being 'productive', we'd see the profits, all the clockwork-- it's 'working', viola-- thanks to cooperation. But... this wouldn't be cooperation. This is the farmer being an apex psychopath and enslaving a species for his gain. The conversation or the \"meme\" of cooperation here, is purely superficial. If you understand this analogy, then you understand all of human cooperation, and all of reciprocal altruism-- it's always co-opted by a dominant party. There is no such thing as perfect pie sharing. Someone always gets a bigger piece, and the story is spun as 'cooperation'.\n\n&gt;Evolution doesn't select for ruthlessness, it simply selects for competitive advantage of any available stripe. \n\nYou're thinking about it the wrong way. You're saying it's wrong to think that evolution favors the overt sociopath thug who just beats others with a bat in cold blood, and eventually risks getting ganged up on. No one thinks that is what evolution favors in complex social systems, clearly. What evolution does favor, is a very sophisticated version of that bloodthirsty, cold, calculated killer thug, who is highly intelligent, who knows not to use a bat because they'll get beat up, who perfectly exploits human social systems, who smiles in such a way that it just melts your heart and causes you to love them, who knows just the right thing to say to get you to do what he wants, and when the time comes, he takes for himself, very calculating, deliberate, and with zero mercy. This is what evolution favors, and any honest look at our world of politicians and CEO's will corroborate this.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568766929,"distinguished":null,"edited":1568767199,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f0nd5no","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d4oymx","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_f0nbiiq","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/d4oymx\/i_have_a_theory_about_people_on_this_sub\/f0nd5no\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1577126262,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Ought sounds very suspect in the context of values, wouldn't you agree?\n\nThat part you quoted will trigger(in the non-dramatic, descriptive sense) any anti-realist, nihilist, or someone deeply convinced that there is a problem between is and ought. I didn't say it to be provocative, but I'm a moral realist so I'll be speaking in moral realist language.\n\n&gt;I'm just a skeptic \/ agnostic so I don't really agree with statements of knowledge and fact such as that. I get the hole burden of proof thing [and maybe I still have a latent fear of His wrath or hell or whatever- that doesn't bother me, I cant control the irrationality of what I fear- Like for instance I had a nightmare a couple of nights ago about a Azrael type figure. Obviously I knew it was just a dream. That didnt stop me from staying awake until morning light, like a dear frozen in headlights, paralyzed by fear [just as an aside, I wonder if there is any etymological link between \"the morning star\" and such dreams? Ive heard that the term lucifer is connected to the hebrew phrase from genesis \"the evil inclinations in the hearts of men\" [edit: which is so close to the idea of the Jungian shadow.]] But I just view the deity as just an analogy for the big bang, kinda thing. Same shit as Brahman or Vishnu, or like the Demiurge. I read it like a story that it is. You don't have to believe a story to find it entertaining or insightful. Probably went of topic soz.\n\nIt's good to go off topic in my view-- our brain has all these patterns that emerge and we tend to suppress them out of concern for others ability to keep track of conversation, but we also rob ourselves of converging on these patterns when we do this. On skepticism, yeah, we agree it's just another one those poverty of language problems. We can say Christianity is false or we can couch every single truth claim including \"a collective consciousness contained in the microfloral substrate of Kimchi conspires to control all human minds\" with our agnosticism. I just refer to what appears to be false, as false, for simplicity, because I find the agnostic game tedious or best left to things which we seem more plausible. The story that God is real and had a son and he got crucified and rose from the dead, and all associated text, is probably just human fantasy, even though there could very well be, and probably is, some wisdom in the entire project. That's not what I refer to when I say \"false\".\n\nTo riff off of what you wrote about Jungian shadow and point out an example of something I think the Christians *are* right about, would be original sin. I think both just describe the same thing, the product of evolution that makes winner monkeys-- what I very broadly call psychopathy and diagnose the entire human race with. We are all lying, domineering, empathy-less manipulative monsters, as far as I see. Christians saw this and called it original sin and said it was caused by falling from grace, and I have no idea what Jung's story is. But the point is our DNA has encoded into it strategies which were used in a million-year murder, rape, cannibalism, child sadism, and exploitation game. And that's **inside** all of us, at this very moment, and continues to shape our reality today in this masquerade of civilization.\n\n&gt;I see what you mean. Of course there's nothing wrong with sharing your views with someone whose open to hearing them and wants a different perspective. I personally don't like the idea of injecting pessimism in to places where people don't want to hear it. \n\nWhen one exposes themselves to social scenarios, they expose themselves to conflicting ideas. The way forward in my view is not to encourage ideological bubbles where people don't encounter ideas they're closed to, to me that's an intellectually dystopian hell. A hellworld where you take daily walks down busy streets with a giant printout of [this artwork](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/y0W0e3A.jpg) is superior to a world where this is censored to dark corners of the internet. A worry I predict here is, \"People will get the wrong idea! You won't even spread your message!\" I kind of don't look at it with that goal in mind. I think that's the wrong approach. For me, it's just about *reflecting* an honest version of reality. Don't lie to people. Don't keep things under wraps. Spread the message of the reality of hell. The conscious message will get jumbled, yes, but the subconscious message won't. The subconscious will know what it sees, and it will be uncanny, because the subconscious has already been in hell and this will only confirm suspicions, there's no beating around the bush from birth here. In most cases, it will only be a blip in their awareness and will be forgotten or rationalized. But what this does is, it shapes all future responses with the subconscious tone of: \"Oh right, I'm in hell\". Behavior has to respond to reality accurately. I think it's bad if people act in this world as if it's a good world, every action should have *that artwork* in mind, either consciously or subconsciously. That's probably going to make no sense to someone who isn't me or similar to me, but that's what comes to mind to try to explain the rationale as simply as possible.\n\n&gt;Shit though dude. Im sure as hell not gonna stop you. I just personally wouldn't do that work because I don't think I could take feeling anymore shunned than I already do. \n\nYeah, heh, that's understandable. I personally couldn't care less about being shunned, I'd rather be the only person out of 7 or 8 billion doing the right thing and be shunned, than being among the 7 or 8 billion doing the shunning, if you made me pick right now. This starts to really make sense in a morally-realistic context.\n\n&gt;My motivation for saying that perhaps its better people don't think about pessimism is motivated by compassion, by a impulse to spare people the brutality of lucidity so to speak. Shit now I feel like the Grand Inquisitor from TBK. I think I can see what you mean from a ethico-epistemological point of view, a kind of socratic point that if only people had knowledge they would suffer less. I tend to think the full expression of that is to realise that there are things that we don't need to know- or dont need to pretend we have knowledge of. \n\nI have no delusions about my motivations, they're not based on compassion, and I don't consider myself to be particularly compassionate. They're based on the same exact fundamental motivations of every other egomaniacal ape on the planet, just errors in the DNA that manifest as selfishness or what ultimately reduces to selfishness. I want to use the word compassion in most of my posts, but I explicitly avoid the word so I don't confuse people about what I'm doing. I can kinda see what put a bad taste in your mouth now, if you think I'm trying to signal compassion to everyone or think that *I* think I'm being virtuous here, or something like that. It's far from that. I agree there are things we don't need to know, but I don't think the hellish nature of reality is one of those things. I think we *need* to know that, and consider it kind of an emergency(this will also explain my behavior). Re: \"What do you value\" -- Truth and its exposure, honesty, resistance of the typical egotism of the ape brain, primarily. The best is when I can mesh the true and honest exposure *of* the egotism of the ape brain. That's what really rocks my world. Reading your values, I'm in another solar system from you value-wise, it seems.\n\n&gt;Anyway. Yeah, go ahead. I'll probably come for you if I ever hear someone screaming Schopenhauer aphorisms in the middle of the night that keep me from my slumber though.\n\nThanks for the approval to go forward, and what a provocative thing to say.

Im inclined to think its an honorific term as Chomsky says. \n\nHave you ever seen a \"2+2=4\" in your life? Sure, that equation may seem sorta true, it seems as if two and two is **real**y four, but it's only a phrase, another phrase can be: \"It's wrong to strategically apply a blowtorch to a small child's hands and feet, to simultaneously maximize their survival and pain for no other reason than your own personal pleasure.\"\n\nBoth are phrases, and as phrases, they are totally ethereal, we can't touch them. If only we were onto something here that didn't take us into our own personal solipsistic sandboxes where we can't even admit that 2+2=4.\n\n&gt;Well its the jew's idea. Did you know they have no personification of satan? its just human shittiness. \n\nYeah, and we can probably trace it back farther than the Jews. I don't think the interesting thing is personifying Satan-- evil should be personified. The interesting thing to me is *how* evil is personified-- and it's personified as a cartoonish, ugly, nasty, mean looking thing(barring very rare blips of a charming Lucifer in a few art pieces). This should be very interesting, because it's nothing at all what evil looks like. Who benefits from painting evil so absurdly everywhere we look, like movies, art, books, from the oldest stories, to the newest? Good always beats this fictional evil, and the end is almost always net-happy. You can argue this is some kind of encouragement of some kind of ideal, but I'm extremely cynical, and see this as an evolutionary phenomenon which obfuscates evil, as you may or may not have heard me repeat dozens of times now. Even the obfuscation could be seen in some kind of non-zero sum terms, where the common people benefit by not having to bear the burden of evil's near omnipotence and near omnipresence, and evil benefits from camouflage-- but the ultimate beneficiary here is again, evil.\n\n&gt;We are pretty close here. I think the original sin is fear of the unknown i.e. the snake symbolically- that which gives us knowledge. Evolutionary fear of the unknown is what motivated us to pick out good and bad, beneficial and determinantal things in the environment- basically fear produces knowledge. Thus no matter how much we know, we only realise how much we don't know and more fear will drive us to keep expanding our knowledge. Its an infintie regress of fear and progressivisim [scientific inquiry- it also takes the form of the idea of social reform, the idea that we could continually move closer and closer to perfection or something when in reality liberal democracy just gets closer and closer to techno fascism and soon we'll have ecofascism. I think there is a way out of the original sin though. Its just to accept fear- I'm always prattling on about acceptance on reddit which feels like a nice jungian shadow irony. Like accepting we dont need to know everything. Get ready to laugh but I saw a comment on a youtube doco about the amish where someone said- we only need to know how to live for 1 life time. Its struck a chord with me. I go even further and say we only need to know how to live for the day- or even just the moment- or in the passage itself [ which reminds me of the idea of stream entry in buddhism]. I also think The Fall is into [si]civilisation, but thats completely co extensive with the development of the label faculty driven by fear of the unknown. \n\nI dunno, it's a pity we don't something like mind meld here because I'm sure that sort of Symbolism\/style of interpretation has some merit, it just doesn't resonate with me very strongly nor do I think it hits the bullseye in regards to what we really mean and what we want to mean, when we talk about \"sin\". Sin is the thing that produces blowtorch sadism scenarios, and all related forms of behavior, down to our desire to lie to each other(or ourselves) for personal gain, all the way to blowtorch sadism itself. We sin because sinning means winning. Specifically, getting away with sin is just the perfection of the jackpot as far as the rules of this game are concerned-- and best of all, the rules *reward* winning. So if the rule is exploit the rules, and you'll get not just better rewards, but better at exploiting the rules **by** exploiting the rules, that's kind of an exponentially explosive problem if the goal is ethics, yeah? That game has been in motion, in unbroken chains of exploiters, for hundreds of thousands of years at least in something that resembles apes like ourselves. We are currently sitting in a scoreboard containing nearly 8billion players, based on how well we covertly sin. Even if we remove fear of the unknown, let's just pretend we're all fearless risk takers hypothetically, you still have the game theoretical problem I described where cheaters are rewarded.\n\n&gt;\"All\" seems hyperbolic but I see why you'd say that. I don't think were monsters, just animals trying to be comfortable and secure. Animals with a hyper acute ability to draw inferences [I call it the taxonomical faculty- like, snakes were bad in the past, lets stay away from them and call them \"bad\". I suppose we would have noticed edible floral recurring seasonally and thought \"good, more secure, less effort.\" Hence \"the fall\" into sedentary societies. Or second fall I guess. The first one could be out of the trees. \n\nIt's not hyperbolic if you acknowledge this occurs on a gradient. It doesn't have to be either or, we can both be animals as you describe and monsters as I describe. We're probably just describing the exact same thing, through different lenses, and if we could just put on each other's glasses, we'd be mortified or amazed depending on whose glasses we're looking through.\n\n&gt;&gt;the point is our DNA has encoded into it strategies which were used in a million-year murder, rape, cannibalism, child sadism, and exploitation game.\n\n&gt;*Hetfeild starts yarling \"Sad But True\"\n\nI see you're coping quite well in regards to hearing some extremely nightmarish news, the appropriate response to which, if soberly acknowledged, is very likely immediate suicide. Perhaps coping a little *too* well. \n\n&gt;It still seems like your subjective value though. *shrug. I means its a platitude but I don't think there is anything inherently better about, what I would term, a repressed society- like we live in- and a openly pessimistic one. I mean look at the pessimism of the fin de siecle. You could argue that lead to WW1 and that to WW2- to yank imperialism and the nihilo-hedonism of modern consumerism infecting the global. \n\nYeah, the whole \"subjective\" thing seems to be a really defining disagreement for people. There's a sharp line separating two groups, one of which insists that since we're all subjects, and anything that can make sense of reality must be a subject, all values must be **subjective** by definition. This makes *so* much sense. It's such clean logic that people just don't question it and they get extremely comfortable with this line of thinking, and then build upon this foundation more representations of reality. At this point it often becomes a terminal case of spaghetti code that can't be fixed. But for people who don't buy this line of thinking, it's possible to examine reality differently. It's possible to even discover that there are **objective values** in the same way that there are objectively true statements about numbers. Perhaps some of these people reject all truth fundamentally, and this solipsistic game has no rebuttal other than \"Okay, we'll be engaging in reality over *there*, seeya\" or \"Perhaps this fire applied to your face will demonstrate one element of reality to a satisfactory degree? Totally optional, at your experimental leisure\". Unfortunately, the idea of objective values will be so preposterous to the aforementioned category of people, there's just no combination of words to resolve this problem. It has to be resolved through science, so we can discover which sorts of people believe what, which brain states, which life experiences, which personality types, quirks, disorders, deficiencies, aptitudes, and so on, cause which representations of reality. Once we map that out, people debating these things can resume the conversation. Until then, we'll all just be speaking different languages.\n\n&gt;Oh, Now I get why you gave that preface about anti-realists and nihilists. I would't say im an anti realist but an acosmic [specifically the Shakespearean idea that the worlds a stage and the men and women actors]. I reckon a society is defined by the stories it tells itself. [Like the Jew for instance. The only way they can treat the Palestinians like that is because they believe the story that they're the chosen people and that Canaan is there home land [despite the fact that they're not from their originally- even in their own story.] ] \n\nHmm, yes, I'm very sympathetic to this \"story\" based view. Here leftist philosophy in its efforts to \"deconstruct\" reality has done some heavy lifting. Even the concept \"Palestinian\" and \"Jew\" are merely stories themselves. They're still real, but only in a superficial sense. Aliens observing us certainly wouldn't say \"Palestinians and Jews\", they're much more likely to call them both things like \"hairless ape sect belonging to genetic and cultural grouping 3409, situated in spacetime stretch 10349409c\", and so on. But it's not just stories that define reality, it's also reality, rules like natural selection, the second law of thermodynamics, etc.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568799738,"distinguished":null,"edited":1568799927,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f0o7fl0","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_d5du58","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_f0nx7uo","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/d5du58\/thomas_ligotti_on_the_taboo_of_pessimism_in\/f0o7fl0\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1577141268,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

At least the former has the end in mind of equality and not inequality.\n\nWell, things like dictatorships of the proletariat or even various forms of anarchy may be *preferable* to liberal democracy, but even if these could exist in practice, they wouldn't actually be what they claim to be, just like liberal democracy isn't what it claims to be. The fact is, any system of government that doesn't represent the rules of natural selection, is never going to be that system, since the only *actual* rules are the rules of natural selection, at all times, no exceptions. Unless God rips open spacetime, parts the clouds and peeks out from them saying, \"Sup guys, I'm watching you. Better behave\" or aliens with powerful technology show up and essentially say the same, this will be the case. Come to think of it, *even* in the aliens case, it would simply be a matter of who could best exploit the aliens all seeing eyes and technological wrath most optimally. But yeah, idealist political systems are either impossible or not meaningful, and totalitarianism\/authoritarianism of some form is ever-present in human society, and constantly growing stronger, enveloping the world, and it cannot be stopped. The same goes for life. The pyramid is eternal and indestructible, yet it can be camouflaged(which, I just now realize, will likely happen with time. Nostradamus-esque prediction: The pyramids of Egypt will be destroyed in the next hundred years. What'll be a good narrative there? Down with hierarchy, yay equality?)\n\n&gt; But I think theres a difference between being honest and broadcasting the truth.\n\nYeah, well, it depends because there are distinct kinds of truth broadcasting. There're inconsequential truths, harmful truths, and so on. I've already told you what amounts to the idea that I think it's wrong to want to eat steak in the matrix-- you have to be selfish to do so. You're defending steak eaters, here, both conscious and unconscious. You're saying, \"nonono, look, you can't just *talk* about the Matrix all day to people who are plugged in, that's so... uncouth!\" While you get the luxury of reflecting on reality, the luxury of recognizing this is hell, the luxury of deciding whether or not one should kill themselves in hell, and so on. I don't envy steak eaters, but you seem to, so our values are simply widely divergent here. Cognitive sciences(and perhaps psychopharmacology) will explain that difference, ultimately.\n\n&gt;&gt;I think it's bad if people act in this world as if it's a good world\n\n&gt;Why though? They actually believe it is.\n\nWe covered this already, no? Moral realism. It isn't meaningful to me for one's beliefs to not track reality. Here, let me spell out the consequences of your value system and logic: \n\nImagine you're the father of an 8 year old boy. You're not pessimist you, you don't live in an evil world-- instead, you're in a hypothetical universe which is *generally* good. Sure, bad things happen in a very vanilla, 10 o'clock news sort of way every now and then, even *really* bad things, but in general life is good, stress free, and so on. It's a magic universe we're making scientific breakthroughs in, constant progress, etc. Now, since this universe makes ours seem like a paradise despite the reality of occasional tragedy, we get some pretty sweet drugs. You get your hands on such a drug, the street name for which is Bliss, and that's what it does. Everything becomes bliss. Sheer bliss. Did you just stub your toe on the door? Bliss. Just euphoric, orgasmic, stupor. It's hard to stub your toenail of course, since you're on the couch, fairly overwhelmed, for the 8 hour duration of this drug which you're in the middle of experiencing in this hypothetical. But you're also very unlucky, unfortunately. You see, your son's math tutor is one of the few sadist pedophiles in this otherwise benevolent world. And you see, this person knows about bliss, and for kicks, decides to rape and torture your son right in front of you as you sit there on your couch, for the next 2 hours. What is this experience like, for you? Well, obviously, it's **bliss**. Subjectively you're just having a blast. To even call your experience orgasmic would be insufficient, it's just pure pleasure, pure epiphany, you look on at your son's tears and begging and screaming until no energy is left and his dissociating eyes stare blankly at the wall, and you're just *beaming* with joyous ecstasy as you interpret all of this.\n\nShould you care that this is happening? According to the outlook you've expressed, you shouldn't, because your subjective experience is all the justification you need. You don't seem to care if your bliss actually converges with reality in a meaningful way, this is just more steak eating in the Matrix. For you, only subjectivity matters. That's how you see this world--as a purely subjective world. Now, to understand my position, you have to understand that I don't see the world as a subjective world. I see it as an objective world containing subject-objects. I see every subjective experience, as simultaneously, an **objective** experience. And that subjective experience can match closer or farther to objectivity. When you're tripping on bliss while your son is raped, you're failing miserably to match objectivity in a way that you wouldn't want to if you *only* knew your failure. Failing here is a bad thing, to me(Value: Truth). To you, it seems like it's no problem. But presumably, if you care at all about this hypothetical son you have, you ought to care that your subjective experience does not latch on to reality in the slightest. But if I could converse with you while you're on bliss, there's just no way to make sense of that. And I don't think the conclusion there for me would be, \"Oh well... I mean when I ask the guy, he *claims* he's thrilled that his son is endlessly raped so... who am I to say anything? Better to practice some temperance and prudence on this one.\" I say exactly the opposite, I say you're tragically high, slam that antidote, and watch as you fall to your knees and vomit after having reality boot you in the face. And if you have any sense, you'll thank me. Notice how fucking confused(or just narcissistic) you have to be, to say, \"You fucking asshole! ...I was having a great time over there!\" There exists a point to miss here, and it rests on the presence or absence of certain spaghetti code in the brain.\n\n&gt;Im just passing time bro [?]. I feel like i've divested from the world and am just an observer at this point. \n\nSure, you can tell yourself you're just passing time, but you're still just an ape like everyone else on reddit, mutually masturbating with each other, ejaculating our egos, trying to convince each other, playing various social dominance games, and more. All of this behavior is just an expression of DNA, which is pressing the muzzle of the handgun into your temple whether you like it or not. You don't get to \"just observe\", DNA doesn't share your values.\n\n&gt;Idk i think the community at large would agree with me that more than a chat would be necessary if you were really keeping us all awake... Im just joking i reckon. I probably would just chat with you as long as you stopped howling. \n\nWell, that would be interesting if consensus mattered at all when it comes to what is true, which it doesn't. You can have consensus among 7billion people all high on Bliss(tm), but... who cares about that? I don't think I've ever seen a joke that was just a joke in my entire life. Every time you joke, you express some form of reality. Every joke is a broad sublimation of some kind.\n\n&gt;Just out of interest, what do you think of the Silenus' wisdom? Would you see suicide as... a violation of the duty you feel maybe?\n\nNot sure what you're asking with the last part. I agree with Silenus' wisdom, but it's unclear if suicide leads to annihilation, and it's unclear what the best suicide circumstances are. The end is not \"suicide is optimal\", that's just the beginning. Being psychologically ready to die is not the last step before death, that's just the pre-requisite before the logistics game of when to die, how to die, what to die with, etc. If you mean that there could exist scenarios where you need to torture yourself to stay alive and do something important, then yeah, that's possible but I don't see anything I do as a duty in the ultimate sense, since moral responsibility is a religious fantasy.

The good is *always* outweighed and funneled into evil, and almost never the other way around. It's a fundamental law that good is *more* helpful to evil, than evil is to good. That's why evil is evil-- it *feeds* off of good. It skins good alive, and wears the skin of good as a mask, as an outfit. Good can't do this, because it is bound by rules. It takes effort to be good. Evil is just an expression of power and manipulation and egocentrism, nothing more. Good is an expression of restraint to *not* do the wrong thing, to not be an egomaniac, to not exploit just to get an edge. Evil always has an edge because it will always exploit when it can, it will always do harm when it can, it even enjoys doing harm, and the most important property of evil: **appear as if you are good**, or [camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv).

It's the sort of thing the tyrant king *wants* his peasants to believe in, so they can stop revolting to finally die in a great conflagration rather than die as slaves and have their children die as slaves and have their children's children die as slaves. If I were a tyrant King, I would be *thrilled* if all the peasants and soldiers I torture via forced labor and forced combat were Stoic.

In both such cases, Stoicism would in fact be a tragic philosophical outlook to hold.\n\nWith Stoicism, under hell-like conditions, it robs the agent of certain moves which could potentially be morally urgent, like suicide. In short, it simply demands you to value survival. It demands you stay optimistic, even in hell.\n\nAnd that should worry people. Because the core question for every Stoic should be: \"Are we in hell *right now*?\" By hell I mean, a truly worst case scenario, where there are no benevolent moves to make, there is no reason to live another day, every moment, every thought, every behavior performed serves evil forces even if it appears to momentarily serve good.

Maybe ask your mom and let her know that you want to prepare your own food and see if she could save some time shopping and cooking things you won't eat anyway? Maybe she'd be willing to help you out here, just ask her if there is any way she can help. If not, you still just have to try to grab this one by the reins so you can at least feel healthier by customizing your diet to your needs. Your mom clearly won't do this, so you have to start some time.\n\nIn regards to insecurity, yeah, that's a burden that everyone faces to some degree. I think the antidote to insecurity here is the same for everyone. Simply run this thought experiment in your head: There are several criteria people use here in their superficial standards, but imagine you're evaluating yourself based on a single category like weight for simplicity, and imagine you tell yourself something lots of people tell themselves: \"If only I lost 20lbs, I'd feel like that would be good enough for &lt;x potential person&gt;.\" If this is true, this also means that this hypothetical person *wouldn't* be interested if you were just your current weight. But then... why are we losing weight for this person who is so superficial that the entire potential relationship rests on something as stupid as 20lbs? What does that say about that person? Do we... even *want* to lose weight for someone who would reject us for something so trifling? Of course not. The person we're looking for is the person whose attraction wouldn't rest on something as stupid as +\/- 20lbs, right? It would have to be other, more important characteristics, right? From here, you can one by one, plug every single thing you're uncomfortable with about your appearance into this *same* thought experiment. And if you're honest, you'll probably have a list of things that don't really matter to anyone who *matters*. Yes, they matter to shitty human beings, but who cares? Why are we looking for shitty human beings? Now, I won't sugar coat things for you-- this disqualifies a **humongous** number of the human population. But that's okay. That's good. That's better than chasing something that we shouldn't be chasing, right? Also this doesn't mean that you should just do whatever and let yourself go completely, it just means don't fall into the trap of neurosis about a standard of appearance that is pathological in our society. If you want to lose weight, do it for yourself, you shouldn't do it because you're trying to attract someone who would otherwise reject you if you hadn't lost the weight-- you don't **want** that person to begin with.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568876227,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f0r7sk8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d69n8q","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_d69n8q","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/d69n8q\/mom_passed_down_a_medical_condition_to_me\/f0r7sk8\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1577193199,"score":11,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

The courts seem to constantly(more often than not) give lenient sentences to high status(wealthy, famous, socialite, etc) criminals.\n\nIt's almost as if each nation is incentivized to create a legal system that only superficially doles out punishment for bad behavior, with it's real motive to be more like obstacle course for distilling and selecting the psychopaths who can perfectly exploit the legal system. Since psychopathy must correlate with economic status and social status, only the *best* psychopaths, showing the most restraint and more sportingly expressing their domination over reality while playing by the rules only where necessary to avoid punishment, it would make sense to not punish those who have already climbed economic and other status-based hierarchies in society. This would be like a military harshly punishing it's most elite soldiers-- it just *wouldn't* lead to a strong military. And the stakes here are extremely high, since each society is in a permanent state of economic and cold war against all other societies, simply as entities existing in a closed system where the name of the game is competition(natural selection).\n\nTake the case of [Junko Furuta](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Junko_Furuta). Furuta was raped and tortured by gangsters, with around a hundred people complicit in the 2-3 month torture, by either actively engaging, or being fully aware and doing nothing. It included rape, beating, various genital mutilation, and eventually ended up with her being beaten to death and encased in a barrel with cement. Again, this process lasted 2-3 months, with countless witnesses who could have blown the whistle, but didn't. The main perpetrators received anywhere from 17 years to 5-7 years for this crime. Even in Japan's lax-on-murder legal system, this is considered an extremely light penalty for perhaps one of the worst ongoing sadistic prolonged torture+rape into eventual murders on record, maybe only being trumped by the case of [Elisabeth Fritzl](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fritzl_case).\n\nOne of the only ways to make sense of this attitude is to see the judicial system as not a system of justice, but a system serving as an obstacle course, since each nation is essentially incentivized to create a psychopathic exploitation army to sink costs into it's nation, develop an infrastructure there, run politics, run business, and then destroy the nation or society's enemies with the phenotype of psychopathy, which has now been carefully selected and pressured by a legal system that was not too harsh on it, because if it was, all the psychopaths would be jail, and their powers that could be employed for military, intelligence, government, CEO positions, and so on, would be robbed. Foolish for any truly competitive society.\n\nNote: It's required to defining the term 'pychopath' for the sake of this post and explain what I mean and what I don't mean. I'm not referring to the cartoonish depiction of this condition in Hollywood films, nor am I referring to the rather failed and impulsive serial killers of 70's, 80's, and 90's infamy in the United States. These are not meaningful psychopaths. What I'm referring to with the word psychopathy is the archetype of the powerful figure in business or some other intimidating enterprise, exhibiting the phenotype: Dominating\/Callous\/Self-absorbed\/Manipulative\/Deceptive\/Charming to a perfected degree. This is not the sort of person who lands in prison, to do that, they'd need to *not* be a perfected form of that phenotype. This is not the sort of person who you immediately look at and say \"Psychopath\", that would defeat the whole purpose of the archetype of \"Indomitable power, megalomania, deception, sadism-- camouflaged\". This is just a person that on outside, looks like a powerful and charismatic leader, but on the inside, is rather vicious, Machiavellian, sadistic, egotistical, completely unswayed by ethics, driven only by an unstoppable will to dominate everyone and everything, and so on. This is what I refer to by 'psychopath'.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1568879365,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f0rbs97","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d5993i","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_d5993i","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/d5993i\/felicity_huffman_sentencing_justice_and_fairness\/f0rbs97\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1577195104,"score":4,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Here's what that means:\n\nImagine we could run a perfect simulation of a cataclysm occurs where everyone but a man and a woman is wiped off of the planet. These survivors have total amnesia of what occurred, but they have all of their other capacities in tact, language, and so on. The only purpose of this hypothetical is to simplify the argument for objective, verifiable ethics by proposing only two existing subjects.\n\nFor someone to say there is no testable way to determine how these two people could fail miserably in moral terms, is to deny that a morally implicated endeavor like:\n\n* \"Pick up some of that heavy debris and just take turns bashing each other's knee caps\"\n\nHas any verifiability in principle or in practice, in being a worthwhile strategy for producing moral outcomes.\n\nThat statement, to someone who denies this, **either** has absolutely no difference in moral terms from a statement like:\n\n* \"Treat each other with consideration in regards to each other's wellbeing and capacity to suffer\"\n\n**or**\n\nIt is completely **impossible** and **inconceivable** to verify *any* difference, using *any* parameters, in expressing some fact about the way human beings move towards good or bad. Alternatively, another way people tend to dishonestly approach this, is questioning what good and bad is, as if setting someone on fire for no good reason is completely indistinguishable ethically from generally showing them respect as a sentient being who can suffer.\n\nYou can always find something here to pick on, but ultimately, you have to ask yourself: \"Is my concern equally analogous to the objective truth of a science of human health?\" Because just about every serious argument posed against objective and verifiable ethics, also can be thrown at the objective and verifiable science of human health.

Some people say objective, others say, impossible. Let's first acknowledge that, and acknowledge, that confusion *must* be present. We don't know, no matter which side we fall on, *which* side is confused(Both could be confused, both could be confused in different ways, both could be right in a certain context and suffer from tiny semantic confusions, etc.)\n\nOne way for the side arguing against objective morality to *test* if their reasoning is right, is to plug in **every argument** in favor of objective morality, into what we already acknowledge as the objective scientific claims regarding human health. We don't have perfect health science, right? But we **know** it's objective. We know that your health will **objectively** get worse, if we simply set fire to 90% of our skin. This *should* be uncontroversial. If your **only** uncontroversial statement regarding health was the acknowledgement that: \"Setting fire to 90% of our skin will **objectively** worsen health\", this is sufficient to know that health **must** be an objective domain. Yes?\n\nNotice what happens if we calibrate reality to *truly* stress test this idea. So, moral objectivist-- you claim that setting fire to our skin objectively worsens health? What if this draws the attention of an orbiting alien spacecraft who sees a stupid human about to do something that will lead to worsening health, and death, if untreated, and decides to say, \"Hey, I'll actually play with this specific human's epidermis and implant tiny nano-bots that optimize homeostatis and repair all burns on contact, **increasing** net health whenever flesh is burned.\"\n\nThat wouldn't pose a problem for the objective truth of the relationship between fire and human skin, it would just be a special caveat which adds **more** objectivity to the question of health. Right?\n\nSo we know that it's complicated, but we can more or less demonstrate that fire + skin = bad for health. The **rules** of what is bad for health, are neither \"justified\" nor \"unjustified\", **they justify**. How? How do they justify? Well, they justify you **not burning your flesh, if your goal is improving health.** There's no \"justified\" rule, the rule **itself**, is what **justifies**. Re-read the quote and apply it to ethics:\n\n&gt;The permissibility rules you accept are for you neither justified nor unjustified: they justify.\n\nNow, look again at how you're looking at this problem:\n\n&gt;As far as I can tell, if you agree with the author, then there is no thought experiment you can use to test whether or not breaking kneecaps is morally worse than being compassionate\n\nThe idea that there is no thought experiment(or even **real**, verifiable, scientific experiment) we can use to test whether or not breaking knee caps is worse for human thriving than behaving pro-socially makes exactly as much sense as the idea that there is no thought experiment(or scientific experiment) we can use to test whether or not inhaling asbestos is worse for lung health than inhaling polutant free, sea-level atmosphere, that is, it makes no sense at all, if you simply acknowledge the confusion regarding justification.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1569037387,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f0xm875","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d5by38","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_f0xd6y8","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/d5by38\/our_morality_a_defense_of_moral_objectivism_issue\/f0xm875\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1577303423,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

These are all very... \"Me me me\" psychological strategies, and they can differ in complexity and approaches to social situations, and what not. One piece of advice I think is useful is to not let yourself get boxed in. Don't look for **a** disorder, think of it more like \"a little bit this, a splash of that, oh *this* seems most significant, but those other two still seem strangely *familiar*...\"\n\nThis idea that people are just \"one thing\" makes absolutely no sense. The whole complexity of the brain, of psychology, and even personality just can't be that rigid, or else we'd just be like... these cartoon characters, without much nuance.\n\nNow, my fairly amateur opinion after reading your post: You don't sound meaningfully narcissistic. There are however, a **lot** of first person pronouns you're using, but this doesn't necessarily mean narcissism. The way you question and show concern for your self-model is very, uhh... difficult to match with narcissism. Narcissists are very insecure deep down inside but they just don't self-reflect like you are doing in your post. The classic \"If you're worried that you're a narcissist, you're probably not a narcissist.\" applies here. You seem to acknowledge that you crave or go to extremes for attention, so like the other person I think of histrionic, but also some potential BPD signs too. You may also find researching the concept of \"learned helplessness\" very illuminating. \n\nThat's really all I have in regards to that, but I also just want to let you know that even if you may sometimes entertain the thought, there aren't any *truly* good reasons to hate yourself or to worry so much about what others think of you or even need others' validation-- they've got their own issues in most cases, right? And if none of us created these circumstances that made us who we are, how can we blame ourselves or blame others or worry about others thoughts about us, or crave attention from someone who really has no special \"worth\" which we somehow lack when this is all arbitrary? Wouldn't it be healthier to just take a deep breath and acknowledge that this is just a bit of a crazy world in general, and recognize that each person has their own strange quirks, many of which are hidden from our view, and if we sit down and think about things calmly, the whole emotional roller coaster we suffer from day in, day out-- the constant ruminating thoughts, nonstop... Thinking thinking thinking, about others, about ourselves, and so on...\n\n... wouldn't it be helpful if we first acknowledged this really just eats us alive? On a daily basis? Psychologically, mental-health wise, socially? But it's actually possible to break out of that by just looking at those thoughts from a distance. That's my advice here really if you wish to try it, just examine the thought, and not even reacting to it but just kinda going, \"Huh... that's interesting that this thought comes to mind. This insecurity, or this resentment, or this jealousy, or this sadness from whatever event or loneliness or rejection or whatever.\" Just let yourself look at it from a distance, take a deep breath or three, close your eyes, and just examine it. The feeling, the thought, the words, everything about it, observe what you find and be open and non-judgemental. Maybe pretend like you're a scientist robot if it helps, and you're taking this violent or sad or manic thought and putting it under a microscope, and just calmly looking at it. \"What is ...*this* ... thing? Does it make sense? Why is it here? What does it cause?\" Always calmly asking, and prodding, and examining. If you do this enough, you will discover that the thought no longer holds you hostage, and you won't suffer nearly as much as when you're just in the middle of the thought-storm. \n\nBy just *looking* at it, it stops having that stranglehold over you where you're like some mental kidnapping victim to these constant, incessant thoughts. Anyway, that's all I've got, hope it helps, wish you a drama-free and struggle-free path forward.

There are genuine ways to debate that suicide should be permissible for people who are fairly unlucky and are convinced it's what they want, and it's even possible to argue that suicide could be the single most urgent choice for all people, based on certain parameters of our universe and planet.\n\n I think as a starter, we have to address the fact that this is a deeply emotional topic, with extreme sunk costs, and extreme vested interests(each nation wants their citizens to suffer and be Stoics and keep suffering while serving as peasants and soldiers, because reality is a competition game).\n\nWe want this reality to be livable deeply. No one wants to grapple with the extremely repulsive idea that death could be superior to life. We have cultural incentives against this, geopolitical incentives against this, psychological, genetic, biological, the list goes on. This is a **massive** bundle of biases. That should be taken **very** seriously.\n\n&gt;Happiness is peace.\n\nHappiness may be peace, and ignorance may be bliss, but what we should be ultimately concerned with, as Sam Harris himself appears to be strongly committed to above all else, is what is **true**. So what *is* true about this world, exactly?\n\nWell, the fact that our world is largely a [meat grinder](https:\/\/youtu.be\/95c5GTp__AU) for countless hundreds of millions of years. Just imagine the scope and scale of suffering.\n\nThen there's the fact that many human lives are a [hellish circus of pain](https:\/\/youtu.be\/m_6Y5H9ngZc?t=86), where people are [trapped in beds in extreme physical and psychological misery](https:\/\/youtu.be\/S8Axe8lyhL0). Those of us who don't appreciate these conditions, tend to draw lines for people who really are in a better position to speak about human suffering, and what describes a life worth living. The problem is, the people who have lives *most* worth living, tend to preach to people whose lives are *least* worth living. This is a very serious problem.\n\nAnother issue is the fact that there are hints, facts about our world that suggest that our species is quite a bit *darker* than we like to think. The fact very well may be that we are a psychopathic(evil) and psychotic(delusional, strongly prone to optimism bias, wishful thinking, false beliefs, etc) species. We enslave those weaker than thus, both [animals](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3315) and humans, the majority of which are forced to work shitty labor jobs, with a childhood involved neglect, trauma, ostracism, bullying, and a generally poor quality of life. This is the 'pulse' of reality, but again, the problem is people with lives deemed worth living tend to tell these unfortunate people that death is indeed bad, and that life is indeed worth it. This is a **serious** problem.\n\nThis only scratches the surface, of course. This is a very long and complicated conversation, but first we have a long hard job of figuring out the exact nature of reality before we can ever confidently say \"Life is worth it\" or \"Death is best\" in any broad terms. I would encourage you to not advocate against suicide before truly getting into the nitty-gritty of these questions, because the road to hell is often paved by good intentions, and we suffer with deeply inadequate \"intention\/consequence evaluation tools\". I will agree with Harris's(and likely your) prescription for mindfulness, because we need cognitive fitness, focus and clarity to address such a serious topic.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1569046113,"distinguished":null,"edited":1569046810,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f0xtimk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d75s5z","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_d75s5z","permalink":"\/r\/suicidology\/comments\/d75s5z\/how_stop_suffering_the_right_way\/f0xtimk\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1577306957,"score":12,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"suicidology","subreddit_id":"t5_2shhl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/suicidology","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

We can and do have justifications for considering peanuts as healthy.\n\n&gt;In contrast, according to the author, if Sam adopts the rule \"inflicting extreme pain is permissible\" then the fact that most people don't want to experience pain has no bearing on whether or not Sam is in error.\n\nAs I'm reading this, I'm constantly trying to put myself in the shoes of the person who rejects the idea of a testable ethics, and what we mean when we say 'ethics', and what could potentially think objective ethics means, and every single time I do this(I've been following the \"ethics is\/isn't science\" conversation for many years now) I get this sense that there's something to do here with a misunderstanding of subjectivity. The problem with many of these philosophical\/scientific overlaps, like free will for instance, political philosophies, big philosophical questions, and so on, is the fact that our brains simply differ in subtle ways that lead to radical changes in perception. We see the world differently, not just because of different experience, but quite literally different firmware. They way we perceive the world can differ in very polarizing ways. Our entire phenomenology can be internalized, or externalized. We can have a total self-absorption, or we can have no\/little sense of self. Again, these things are subtle, they don't get strongly signaled in conversation. This fact is crucial to appreciate, because without this understanding, we can't actually move forward in these disagreements, which is why I seem to be going off on a tangent to address this. This is exact problem I see here.\n\nThere's a fundamental, mutually incompatible disagreement, involving the ontology of subjectivity&lt;-&gt;objectivity. This is what I suspect is the culprit here. People who reject objective ethics, tend to be very subject-centered in their phenomenology. They tend to struggle to intuit that our subjective experience(like the description that pointless misery is bad), is an **objective** truth claim. They see it as some kind of whimsical preference, trapped in subjectivity, forever outside of objective truth, and this is the root of the confusion. Here's the big revelation, if you just want to take one sentence away from all of this to explore: **Everything you could call subjective, is also objective.** This includes every preference, every thought, from the conscious to the subconscious, it all exists in descriptive, algorithmic conceptual space, not only in relationship to the physical world, but as an ontological whole in **existence**. There is **no** barrier here, it's all objective. There's no dichotomy. There's no \"my experiences are inside and only inside, and then the physical stuff is outside.\" Every **inside** is simultaneously **outside**. \n\nTo further elaborate on what causes this perceptual problem, people who hold this view of hard subject\/object dichotomy, tend to have some very unifying characteristics. This should strike us as very scientifically interesting. They tend to be high in the trait \"self-absorbed\" in purely descriptive terms. They tend to be drug naive, specially in reference to psychedelics. They tend to be closed to or not engaging in practices like meditation, which expose the fact that there is no subject\/object dichotomy. These ontological ideas *are* science, right? All we need to do is get people to experience both phenomenologies, reflect on both, and then come to a conclusion. It's as if half the world were blind, and the other half weren't, and one group would tell another, \"No no no, you don't see(literally), you just need to have this thing called visual input first.\" and the other said \"What are you talking about? You're probably hallucinating. The visual field is basically just darkness.\" All we need to do, if we ever find ourselves in this scenario, is to get the people with vision to become blind, and then have the blind gain vision, and then we can resume the conversation. The problem is, people currently are concluding things based on having only experienced **one** of these two phenomenologies(to make the analogy perfect, all visual field people were *once* blind), and that is the group who are **only** experiencing subject\/object dichotomy. \n\nMy solution to this is for this group who accepts a hard subject\/object dichotomy to seek the experience \"Ego-death\", and then report back. It's not a permanent experience, but it's an experience that radically transforms ontological understanding.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1569104407,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f0zxqa9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d5by38","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_f0zm457","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/d5by38\/our_morality_a_defense_of_moral_objectivism_issue\/f0zxqa9\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1577343429,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

It's one thing to say \"I accept the idea that life is suffering\", but it's another to truly and deeply understand. The range between these two states is vast. And as animals who are prone to be more and more allergic, the further one goes beyond simply acknowledging something that amounts to \"Life is more or less bad\", many of us are doomed to be walking through reality without ever appreciating just *how* bad it is. It's not that it's bad, many people already know that.\n\nMy mission is more about **how** bad.\n\n[Baboon eating gazelle like a piece of fruit](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=15)\n\n[Sadist pedophile describes prolonged rape and torture of stepson](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=985)\n\n[Hitchens tells the story of Elisabeth Fritzl](https:\/\/youtu.be\/1fU725kmUk8)\n\n[A gradation leaning into Harris's \"Worst possible misery\", but for cows](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3315)\n\n[Lion cub is murdered by capricious and domineering animalistic behavior](https:\/\/youtu.be\/1x9zbO1-0Uc?t=215)\n\n[Boy tortured by health misfortune forced alive because of a culture which is written *by* winners, embraces suffering and life as inherently virtuous](https:\/\/youtu.be\/m_6Y5H9ngZc?t=86)\n\n[Young elephant eaten alive by predators](https:\/\/youtu.be\/95c5GTp__AU)\n\nAnd so on...\n\nI wish I had a video expressing the perfection of psychopathic evil that rules our world, but I have no such video, because this force is by nature permanently obscured.\n\nAlmost no one holds this reality up for examination daily. We are allergic. Most of us have near-zero understanding of the gravity, and those who have glimmers, ignore this fact about the quality of our reality because it's not conducive to living another day. Why must we live another day? Because genes which give rise to culture, all of which is determined by game theory which more or less says, \"Psychopathy wins and holds dominion over this game\". Natural selection is a game where evil wins, not good. Good is kept around for the purpose of evil wearing it's skin like a mask. Good is not adaptive, in the precise way that the cow in cow hell has no adaptive trait. It's alive. It will bear children. Those children will bear children. But nothing \"adaptive\" is going on. How? The fact of the matter is, a psychopathic species has kept the herbivore alive for its own gain. This is the precise relationship that evil has to goodness. Goodness is kept alive. Buddhism is kept alive. Any genuine benevolent religious idea, is kept alive. All because evil, which is powerfully [camouflaged](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv), dominates reality and presses onto it in a way which goodness can never overcome.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics crystallizes that which natural selection distills. It's easier to break something than to fix it. It's easier to write a bad law than repeal it, harder to write a good law with no loopholes than to have it impeded. Easier to engineer and spread a plague than to cure it. Easier to take a good life than an evil life. Entropy constantly empowers that which is empowered by virtue of being the perfect distillation of evil, like the Lion, like the predator, like the apex psychopath who is, has always, and will always sit on the throne of all sentient systems in this block of spacetime moving towards greater entropy.\n\nBuddhism is not totally accurate because it is genetically engineered into a tarnished deformity very much like the cow, who was once benevolent, but now is a tarnished deformity with udders so engorged that it cannot stand. Buddhism exists on the entropy gradient, therefore it exists to camouflage and serve evil to some degree. This is a property of all things existing in a psychopathic entropic gradient, which modulates the things distilled by natural selection-- perfected forms of evil, all while holding good up like a carrot. Life is not simply suffering. Life is an evil dystopian hell with no winning moves, a kind of \"worst case scenario\". The specific properties that guarantee this are: 1) evolution by natural selection(evil wins, evil gets stronger, preying on good), 2) entropy-- Evil thrives once it achieves power because the powerless must work against entropy, where evil only plows forward exhibiting its nature effortlessly. Good must go *against* nature to be good. Evil does not need to do anything special to go *with* nature.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1569106833,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f103m23","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d75s5z","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_f0zffaf","permalink":"\/r\/suicidology\/comments\/d75s5z\/how_stop_suffering_the_right_way\/f103m23\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1577346248,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"suicidology","subreddit_id":"t5_2shhl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/suicidology","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I should have pointed that out sooner, since you keep mentioning that I diverge with the author-- I do not endorse everything this author writes, I came here to respond to an analogy regarding what is testable and what isn't, and to discuss this.\n\n&gt; However, \"mint is the tastiest flavor of ice cream\" is subjective: it can be true when I say it and false when you say it, since it depends on the preferences of the speaker.\n\nYou're describing the objectivity of aesthetics here, not ethics. I do argue for an objective framework of aesthetics as well, but I won't do that here, I'm really just interested in morality. Let's try to reword your statement to include a seemingly subjective claim in moral terms(or feel free to submit something different):\n\n&gt; However, \"I don't want to get tortured with a blowtorch\" is subjective: it can be true when I say it and false when a sadist says it, since it depends on the preferences of the speaker.\n\nSo, the objective ethics that I'm describing, have **zero** prescriptive property. People have smuggled a kind of prescriptive nature to ethics, due to confusions regarding cultural norms, where ethics *must* be obeyed. This is a bad starting point. Instead, forget what you think you know about ethics, and look at ethics differently. Ethics is no different ontologically, than health. Health seems like a thing we all want, right? Just like ethics. But health's job isn't to tell you to **do** healthy things, right? Again, read that sentence another time. **The job of the science of health, is not to prescribe, fundamentally**. The job is to **describe**. Daily consumption of excess calories, comprised of **nothing** other than pork lard and high fructose corn syrup, is an unhealthy practice. This is an objectively true statement, in an objective field: Health.(Fun note: Notice how utterly unproblematic it would be for the objective nature of the field of health, if we discovered a group of humans in a remote island who had a perfect bill of health while subsisting on a diet of lard and HFC-- this is very important to understand when trying to understand what objective ethics really *means*)\n\nEthics is **identical** to this, ontologically. Just consider: \"Daily torture of children for no good reason, is an unethical practice.\" This too, is an objectively true statement, in the objective field: Ethics.\n\nArguments you tend to see in response to this:\n\n* \"But you can't *test* that claim.\"\n\nFirst of all, you can in principle, since ethics isn't that mysterious. As long as it's testable in principle, it's scientific domain. Ethics has to do with sentient well being, not things which completely lack any relationship to conscious or sentient experience, this is an uncontroversial fact. We know ethics have objective parameters, because we can easily think of what is meaningfully unethical: A hell of pointless torture. No one wants a hell of pointless torture. Restructure the hell however you want, but insofar as you are a sentient being, we can calibrate a hell for you, and that's bad. Bad ethics must have meaning in the same ontological sense that bad health has meaning, since they both endeavor to describe things about sentience. The exact same arguments that apply to ethics, *also* apply to health. Just think of any possible argument against the meaningfulness of bad and good ethics, and this exact same reasoning, will also apply to bad and good health. Yet we know health is objective, so it's not inconceivable that our intuitions are leading us astray with regards to ethics. If bad and good health is objective and meaningful, and the exact same ontology which applies to health, also applies to ethics, then therefore, bad and good(better and worse) ethics must be objectively descriptive. If we lived in a universe where we somehow could never test health(just imagine some absurdist world where this is true) this wouldn't mean health isn't objective, it would just mean health is not testable at the given time, and we should *strive* to test it, and we should absolutely **not** engage with health as if it were subjective(a matter of opinion), since this is clearly wrong.\n\n* \"What if someone disagrees with the idea that pointless torture of sentience leads to misery?\"\n\nWhat if someone disagrees that vaccines are beneficial? What do we do? What if someone disagrees with chemotherapy and insists on crystal healing? These are not problems for the field of health, and they wouldn't be a problem for the field of ethics. \n\n* \"But you can't ever tell someone to not torture people, so how could ethics be objective?\"\n\nYou can't ever tell someone(in some hard science sense) not to drink bleach for nutrition. There are no Health Military police ready to bash your door down if you're sniffing glue to prevent  you from doing unhealthy things. The only job of the objective field of health, is to tell you, \"Sniffing glue is bad for you.\" This is a fact. The only job of an objective field of ethics, is to tell you, \"Raping and viciously beating children is wrong.\" That is a fact.\n\nEdit: To touch again on what I think the core confusion is, since none of what I wrote above will ever make sense to you if my diagnosis of the core confusion, one post prior, is operative. A friend saw my post and asked me:\n\n&gt;Is your (leanings toward) rejection of the subject\/object dichotomy relevant in your conception of objective morality?\n\nI wrote, in response:\n\n&gt;Okay, so I think a hard subject\/object dichotomy(people deeply stuck in the distinction between self and reality), will suffer and be confused ontologically. That's true for understanding the nature of ethics, and also aesthetics.\nBecause everything will simply seem a matter of preference.\n\n I tried to touch on this earlier with my analogy to groups of people, some of whom had working sense of vision and others who were visually blind. The subject won't be able to grasp the idea that all subjective things are part of an objective, descriptive reality, and therefore a descriptive objective framework. Subject states will *appear* strictly as a matter of preference. The *reason* this happens, is rooted in phenomenology, and in so far as our phenomenology differs here, we can never converge on what the ontological nature of ethics is, and reality in general.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1569112580,"distinguished":null,"edited":1569113906,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f10hdr2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d5by38","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_f10cv8x","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/d5by38\/our_morality_a_defense_of_moral_objectivism_issue\/f10hdr2\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1577352835,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Buddha did not know the things we know today. I've not been to a retreat, but I have a fair amount of meditation experience. Unsure why you say \"1 hour\", I don't see how the time matters, since I've sat and observed for 2+ hours before, but the quality of the practice is what matters as much as the quantity of time spent practicing. I have had psychedelic experiences which dramatically jarred the self-model, and as a result, I fully appreciate how we are held hostage by thoughts, and ego, and I have no illusions about currently having broken from this ego, I'm just at the location where I remind myself throughout the day to not underestimate it.\n\nBut yeah, I think we need to forget Buddhism's doctrines and examine only the facts. What harm can come, if we simply plug a new evaluation into reality to examine? If it's untrue, we can return to the old conception.\n\nThe problem with meditation is that it is a tool of clarity, but it is ultimately a tool of dissociation which *can* cause harm and confusion, and it can cause relief from suffering too. The neurological and psychological phenomenon of meditation is nothing more than dissociation + attention. This is the scientific character of no self and being in the moment.\n\nThe problem with this state, is it is possible to sit idle during atrocity in such a state. It is possible to meditate into a state where rape and sadism towards children *no longer matter*. Let this sink in, because this is very crucial. Ultimately, the phenomenology and the firmware of the meditator will determine insights. If we could force Ted Bundy to meditate, he would still be a psychopath, in so far as he had psychopathic firmware. This means that many meditators are potentially led astray, something to take very seriously. This is why I advocate, at least temporarily, beginning again. Dropping all doctrinal understanding of reality, and only examining its nature. Is this universe a good place? Can this universe promote good? Who wins the \"game\" of this place? Who is the ultimate beneficiary of a public engaging in philosophies and religions like Stoicism, or Buddhism?

Imagine a philosophy of health, and what that would look like. Call it meta-health. If philosophy wants to engage in theoretical health, I'm all for that. Great. But imagine how tyrannical it would be if we couldn't have a *field* of health, where we'd struggle to function in a world that couldn't acknowledge that certain things were *truly* unhealthy to humans. This is our world today, but with ethics. We cannot acknowledge child rape is not conducive to human flourishing, as it stands right now, because philosophy has done more to obfuscate truth than reveal it. Can you think of a tremendous, groundbreaking work that has come out of the field of philosophy that has radically transformed human life in the last 100 years? I mean in a truly universal sense, not some intellectual work which only a few fortunate readers can enjoy or understand. I mean a simple, concise idea that actually served some kind of utility.

Your body tells you, forces you, to feel bad when you are lonely. But you can think about this loneliness, too, in a way that strives to be clear-minded. Examine it.\n\nIt's impossible to do this correctly if you're associating to negative or positive things, so you sort of have to force yourself to pretend you're not you. You're not for or against anything, only look at the facts. What is this loneliness? What does it mean? Which people does our loneliness long for? Can these people exist? Is what society and fiction and culture tells us about these people, true? **Do these people exist?** What is required to not be lonely? Is this something truly good people would value and require? Are truly good people real? Are they common? Are we truly good ourselves? etc, etc\n\nWe often feel things, and the feeling is crushing for us. We take that feeling for granted. We never sit and calmly examine the feeling and try to see if that feeling is something we should be feeling in the first place, but I think this is crucial to do.\n\n&gt; A man can be himself only so long as he is alone; and if he does not love solitude, he will not love freedom; for it is only when he is alone that he is really free.\n\n\u2015Arthur Schopenhauer \n\n&gt; Although I am a typical loner in my daily life, my awareness of belonging to the invisible community of those who strive for truth, beauty, and justice has prevented me from feelings of isolation.\n\n\u2015Albert Einstein \n\n&gt; I used to think that the worst thing in life was to end up alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you feel alone.\n\n\u2015Robin Williams\n\nYou're not *really* broken. You're not *really* unwanted. These are just distractions and confusions from a confusing world that very often tells you the various reasons why you should feel bad, when you really shouldn't. The same applies for the body and brain. Just make a game out of figuring things out, and get comfortable trying to understand, and if you do this, loneliness will mostly vanish. Far more safe and effective than any drug could ever be. Just calmly reflect and examine and get comfortable doing that, and that weight on your shoulders will just blow away in the wind.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1569189909,"distinguished":null,"edited":1569190227,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"f15g52g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_d7r45d","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_d7r45d","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/d7r45d\/i_am_so_fucking_lonely_i_can_feel_it_in_my_bone\/f15g52g\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1577438779,"score":46,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}
