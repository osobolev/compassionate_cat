The documentary ['Dominion'](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LQRAfJyEsko) is another fine example of apes dominating lesser beings. We share 91% fo our DNA with the baboons, who are obviously complete psychopaths through no fault of their own. DNA creates psychopathy. DNA creates the incentives for treating other things that can suffer in a way that only serves your needs. Because DNA says, \"ME ME ME ME\" = Good. \n\nThis is where every educated optimist cites reality that all apes express altruism to various degrees. It's *cooperation* and specifically, *selfless sacrifice* that got us to where we are.\n\nI take a more cynical interpretation of altruism. Altruism is a meme that gets co-opted by psychopathy in non-zero sum means. The victim of altruism, which is the altruist, gets some kind of reward for his action. There's the local beneficiary, and then there's the *ultimate* beneficiary - the apex psychopath. The apex psychopath is thrilled about this altruism business. Why? For starters, they can freely maneuver a world where they can pretend to be a good guy through acts of sacrifice or charity. This signals \"I am the good guy.\" Psychopathy needs a complex way to signal this in a powerful way, otherwise it's simply sociopathy(Overt, sadistic thuggery). You can't be evil to the core(brutally selfish\/callous\/manipulative\/dominating) and express your nature in a world without the assumption of good, and even tremendous good(self-sacrificial good). \n\nAltruism is an accident that says: \"The most dominant apes on the planet can abuse this to dominate the world. The other apes get a bone thrown at them to suck marrow from to avoid starvation.\" \n\nThe apex psychopaths say, to altruism: \"Humanity can have their goodness, and their civility, and their ethics, and their charity - because **we** get to abuse this system and win, since we're not playing by those rules.

The same system that wants you to have children, wants you to resent and be tribal and fight and provoke and resent and bully and consider yourself superior, because *if* you're superior, you **get** to reproduce. It's the **same** network of stupid drives. The systems responsible for all reproduction, are both bottom up(DNA\/Drives to reproduce), and top down(The State wants you to have children because it boosts their economy if you create children with special medical expenses, to be martyred so the average citizen who is enslaved by the system may feel they have less to complain about). It's not different than blaming a pedophile for being sexually attracted to children when they were molested as a child, or blaming someone like Ted Bundy for becoming a remorseless psychopath when his entire formative years were the precise environment that enables psychopathic genes.\n\nIf Antinatalists are *right* about Antinatalism, and there was a pill you could give to someone who rejects or misunderstands this 'rightness', which produced an epiphany of clear thought on the topic, people would be mortified they had children after taking the pill.

Watch yourself think as you've been doing, and just notice what you notice. Try to avoid getting lost in that kind of behavior(the condition where you're too absorbed in what you're doing to *notice* something like a paranoid or manipulative thought.)\n\nIt may help to understand the evolutionary basis for paranoia to demystify it. Paranoia is just a strategy for survival. It doesn't have to be a good strategy in every sense to work. Animals can be seen as paranoid or high anxiety, and for good reason. Even if there's no predator, acting like predators are everywhere will increase survival. So it's not *necessarily* a disorder or something to worry about if you simply observe the paranoid thought and then ask yourself \"Do I *need* to worry about this?\"\n\nThe evolutionary strategy of manipulation is a bit more obvious. If you can manipulate other people, you have an advantage. Almost anything animals do can be a kind of manipulation. Camouflage is a manipulation of the perception of predators, it increases survival of your genetic material. Mating rituals are a manipulation of of potential mates, which increases survival of your genetic material. To be a bad manipulator, is to decrease survival of your genetic material. This is true for the moth which doesn't have good camouflage - it gets eaten. This is true for the bird who performs a very unimpressive mating dance - it gets rejected. This is true for the human being whose manipulative behavior is detected by other human beings - it gets labeled manipulative and avoided by peers\/mates.\n\nSuccessful manipulation and paranoia = goes forward. Bad versions = die off. Multiply this by hundreds of millions of years of selection and you have what you see today across all species. \n\nOne last thing, if you're smoking marijuana or doing other drugs that induce psychosis(A fancy way of saying they make you believe things which aren't true, although they can seem and feel very true) it would help to reduce doing these drugs on a daily basis if you don't want to experience the negative side effect of paranoia.

Imagine if a friend you've known for a day treated you this way. Again, you say goodbye immediately.

This is the magic spell you have to basically shake off from yourself, so you can see reality for what it is. Your father has a very serious mental illness, and you are an abuse victim. Gradually wake yourself up to this idea by examining your life and the behaviors around you. Don't react, stay as quiet as possible, don't argue, etc. It does no good.

The relationship between suicide and the religious idea of hell is actually far more connected than you may think.\n\nThousands of years ago, kings and rulers needed religious rules, the \"ultimate rules\" to make their society behave in ways that was convenient for them. If everyone just killed people, that was bad. If everyone just said \"Hey, this society is bullshit. Why are you a King, while I'm a slave?\", that was bad for the king. If everyone just interpreted reality for themselves and came up with their own crazy story, that was bad for the king.\n\nAnd of course, if someone killed themselves 1,000 years ago when your tribes and kingdoms were not the size of United States, Russia, China, India - that was **really** bad for the king, although I'm pretty sure suicide was exclusively for the educated person back then, and educated people were very rare.\n\nReligion tried to solve a lot of these problems. If you broke the rules, you were a sinner, and sinners went to hell. Everything is based on what benefits the king. Homosexuality? Sin. We need heterosexuality maximized for population growth, and for men to be military viable without issues. The crime for homosexuality is death + hell. Murder in the King's kingdom? Only the king and his men get to decide who dies. Sin. Death+Hell. You have a new idea of God\/religion because every monkey brain is uniquely psychotic? Blasphemy. Sin. Death+Hell. Don't want to work? Lazy? Depressed? Sin. Punishment will be Hell, enjoy being lazy. :) Suicide(In the rare case?) Sin. The punishment is hell.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Psychiatry? Psychiatry attempts to solve almost all of these problems in a modern way. Are you lazy\/sluggish\/are a bad worker because you can't focus on mindnumbing, repetitive work? Amphetamines like Adderall. Are you depressed? Suicidal because you're just a peasant who got a bad hand in life, while sons and daughters of \"kings\" inherit the Earth? Antidepressants. Are you having those crazy thoughts, which cause problems with the order which the \"kings\" of 2019 want to ensure? Are you prone to violence or murder or paranoia? Antipsychotics. Stop getting those crazy ideas and be a productive citizen. ;)\n\nIt gets more complicated than this, but if you grant that we live in a dystopia, Psychiatry is perverse institution. And you can more or less glean this truth by just examining drugs like Antidepressants and the \"chemical imbalance\" theory that was pushed for profits and to medicate a large subset of people who knew something was wrong, and a smaller subset of people who knew something was wrong with the human social order itself. If there is a dark truth to the nature of human societies, religion would not be able to cover this truth up forever. You would eventually need a mass drugging of the people to keep things \"orderly\"(Funny, because that word literally means an agent working for an insane asylum), you would need mass medication to keep your citizens 1) productive 2) upbeat 3) prevent them from being too questioning\/using outside of the box thinking. Which is precisely what we see today.\n\nThe threat of hell was the original anti-death\/anti-sin approach. Antidepressants and antipsychotics are the modern anti-death\/anti-sin approach, of course, always prescribed by the kings for thousands of years now.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559549730,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"epvtc02","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bw0ybh","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_bw0ybh","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bw0ybh\/so_i_read_a_comment_in_the_pscyh_ward_for_kids\/epvtc02\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1568799897,"score":5,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

If it is a dystopia, however, your highly reasonable and well intentioned approach becomes unreasonable.\n\nThe thought experiment I have for you is something I'll call something like \"It's Only North Korea\", henceforth known as IONK. In IONK, there is no Russia, China, US, etc. It's only North Korea. The entire world, culturally, politically, exists as one giant extension of North Korea. Naturally, it is a dystopia. Everyone is indoctrinated with propaganda. Most people are worker drones. In such a place, you cannot even *know* you're in a dystopia, because there's no \"Hmm... are we the baddies?\" or \"Hmm... perhaps we aren't the greatest nation in the universe?\" There's simply no point of contrast.

Schizophrenics still exist here, after all. But to mention schizophrenics here is to sort of miss the point. It's a dystopian hell. Yes, schizophrenics should be treated but... there are kind of bigger problems afoot.\n\nYou could turn the dials of a place like IONK to calibrate it in such a way so it resembles our world, without a lot of struggle.

People imagine that in a place like IONK, you'd be sent to a work camp or executed for thinking about such things. But it's wholly possible that the government, military and intelligence agency of IONK is so powerful, they can afford to tell people they're free to say anything, which is a lot like western citizens in 2019 function. Placate your over-stressed worker drones with recreational substances, deeply unhealthy food, endless entertainment options, and again, you have something that resembles modern life.

And to do that, it means that people have to continue to suffer in the meat grinder of human hierarchy. You tacitly accept that children get raped, beaten, abused, bullied, adults lead miserable lives of drudgery and low meaning, and low satisfaction, etc. Animals of course need to aid us in this virtuous goal, so they too need to be subjected to animal hell both in [captivity](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=4477), and in the [wild](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=19). The author would scoff at these things, but he appears to not connect 2 and 2 and grant that by opting to continue this human project, he tacitly Ok's unfathomable misery -- something he probably doesn't enjoy thinking about, or think about in a truly honest way that is connected to the gravity of suffering on Earth. This is a common trend in optimistic psychosis.\n\nThe author says we either fix the vessel(utilitarianism\/nu?) or build a new one(transhumanism). In either of these endeavors, there's simply no guarantee that we don't suffer immensely. The author has some kind of grass roots fantasy interpretation of the world, where if common people simply do good, life on Earth gets better and better and better. What he doesn't appear to appreciate, is we live in world which is subject to some very dominating actors, which don't care about such an endeavor. Natural selection favors them heavily, and indeed, they are reaping these rewards **now**. They create the dystopia you and I live in today. Natural selection does not favor the strategies outlined by this author, because natural selection favors the most dominant, socially powerful(charming, manipulative), callous, egomaniacal human beings. There's no advantage to being the good guy, because the sort of person who ascends to the throne, by definition, cannot be a good guy, since a psychopath who can look **just** as good, while being not bound to the good guys' rules in the privacy of their mind, and a penchant for destroying enemies subtly, is at a clear advantage. The good guy here, in natural terms, is like an eagle without wings. Just a body, legs, beak. Could even have the most gorgeous feathers. But this is irrelevant, because wings are the game changer. And the psychopath, is the eagle with the perfected wingspan. This is why the psychopath rules reality today, and their children, or children who perfect psychopathy further, rule reality tomorrow. Everyone else on the continuum gets to be their cattle, playing altruistic games and talking about improving wellbeing to 51%, which is utterly delusional when you're in a dystopia, since any wellbeing, no matter how real, is illusory.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559676994,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eq029i6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bn9a0r","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_epzyazo","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/bn9a0r\/the_vessel_is_flawed_the_shamefully_poor_state_of\/eq029i6\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1568875249,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I don't think one can be so sure here, and I think anyone who advocates this strategy simply has not weighed the gravity of 1) past suffering 2) present suffering 3) potential suffering. You are essentially gambling when you say \"The show must go on\". You gamble with every second that passes, and tacitly accept immense suffering because some kind of experience is worth experiencing? I don't buy this justification.\n\n&gt;It's certainly possible that the attempt would be a failure (either same or worse suffering), but what if it's not a failure? If you sabotage the attempt, you'd prevent us from experiencing much higher levels of pleasure and virtually no pain.\n\nNo one here is arguing for sabotaging anything. I'm arguing that beyond fixing the vessel, and transcending it, there is a third option available: Stop. Making. Life. Stop the replication game. Stop the meat grinder. Just **stop**. There is **no** apparent reason to continue such immense suffering, and we *know* what drives us to do it! That's the best part! We *understand* that it's just a mindless drive that says \"Me me me me me me, eat, entertain, fuck. Repeat.\"\n\nOnly an egomaniac says \"You know, maybe we should throw some gasoline on this fire because then one day, we could discover a fire extinguisher.

Just really dissect, really **point a laser** at this sentence you made:\n\n&gt;...what if it's not a failure? If you sabotage the attempt, **you'd prevent us from experiencing much higher levels of pleasure and virtually no pain**.\n\nYou are *pretty* tunneled on this idea that preventing some *potential* good experience is a bigger tragedy than all the unimaginable suffering that has occurred, is occurring right now, and will occur. A child has been raped, in total terror and confusion during our short dialogue here. I don't care about the fact that someone just had a blissful epiphany in light of this. That epiphany is not worth the child's terror and pain and a lifetime of trauma. You appear to think it is. Have you considered not only [watching](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OVmhZsjDT58) some [suffering](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=983), but considering the gravity of what you give a pass to just to gamble on some potential positive experience which makes all the depravity worth it?

Maybe a noise, maybe a thought itself, and you feel as if your autopilot just turned off and now you're actually *watching* yourself think at least for a moment before the next thought comes -- you're aware for a little bit here?\n\nThat is a glimmer of mindfulness. The opposite of that, is to be so lost, you aren't even aware that you're thinking. This is useful beyond ruminating about babies, by the way. The goal really is to try to notice yourself think in a way where you're not on autopilot and moved by thought. You're just ragdolled(Think of a dog with a vice-like grip on a stuffed animal that dangles from their jaws - you are the stuffed animal, the dog is the thought.) from that thought, to the next thought. \n\nWhen you see thoughts this way, you can see that they are actually capable of holding you **hostage**.

Thoughts. Feelings. Sensations. Perhaps you're not as relaxed as you thought you were? These things will become clear the moment you try to pay attention to it.

Both positions lack proof here as well, but you're making a affirmative claim on something that isn't substantiated - the burden of proof is on those who say god exists. Likewise, the burden of proof is on those who say free will exists, which has only merely ever been asserted or proclaimed to have been handed down by god.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you use your will for good or bad in arguing for the existence of freedom - the fact that you can use it for good would not grant the idea of freedom any credibility. You can use deterministic will for good as well - something most people who believe in free will would be bothered by. It just wouldn't sit well with them. I think this discomfort exposes the psychology behind why people believe in free will. I've spent a third of my life now on this hobby horse of the illusion of free will, and I have to say I really think the solution is grounded in psychology. Those who believe, need to feel pride. They need to resent others for their decisions. They *need* to punish. It's a very egocentric belief. If you tell people there's no free will, the ego is under attack. It's obvious that the person can no longer meaningfully feel pride - they were simply lucky, nothing more. \n\nI think this is a false worry, as well. Just because there is no free will, doesn't mean there isn't goodness. Goodness is just as good as before - you just can't get a fancy gold sticker on your forehead and think you're better than others just because you did something good, something many people take issue with in the privacy of their own minds.\n\nOn the topic of quantum theory and a pixelated universe, I don't rely on these concepts nor did I mention them to say there is no free will. Quantum mechanics is irrelevant to free will because determinism functions on a non-quantum layer. It doesn't matter if probability or randomness from quantum mechanics leads to determinism, the important thing is, human beings are deterministic, and the universe they live in, is deterministic. There's simply no non deterministic thing in the universe at a level that impacts human behavior, therefore there is no free will.\n\nNo serious physicist today argues that quantum mechanics give us free will - that idea is quite a desperate and embarrassing move. The fact is, you simply didn't make yourself. You didn't choose your geography. You didn't choose your genes. You didn't choose your development, your parents, your peer groups, what ideas you were exposed to. All of these things, made you who you are. The fact that you have a little voice in your head doesn't give you freedom, that voice is a product of everything I just described.

What I'm forced to accept is that a large subset of people, mostly young, who have not had sufficient time to examine the world and understand what the root cause of problems is, will be doomed to confusion. That *really* bothers me. \n\nI fell for it myself before. A note I had written down a few years ago which I heard somewhere, because I thought it *nailed* it:\n\n\"Capitalism is a kind of cultural sociopathy. For a business to be successful in capitalist terms it incentivized do the best possible job of exploiting everyone it does interaction with. The end game of capitalism is that everything is crappier and crappier and people are more and more exploited, because the system is largely unchecked for exploitation at the trade-off for economic progress\/gain.\"\n\nA lot of this is true. I can write on about how it's hard to find good tasting fruits and vegetables anymore, because people grow flavorless, waterlogged decoration pieces for profit. And it's true that exploitation is rampant. But I don't think we should be so hasty to throw the cuffs on capitalism here, I think something far more sinister is to blame. \n\nI've also been rock bottom poor for my entire life, in first world terms. I've almost never gone hungry, but I've always resented the rich, and have pretty much always been at the \"I need to recycle saran wrap after having been unable to afford it for most of my life\" economic status. I was convinced it was capitalism that made people rich, and created this inequality. But this was a very easy mistake to make. Capitalism isn't actually what makes people rich. A **certain kind** of person, gets rich, **through** capitalism. This is a subtle, and very difficult to glean distinction.\n\nThe first mystery is, immense suffering exists whether capitalism is present or not. Here's some fundamental [horrifying suffering](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=19).\n\nWhat does a baboon eating a baby gazelle as if it's a piece of fruit have to do with capitalism or humanity? Well, for starters, baboons share **91 Percent** of their DNA with humans, and Chimpanzees, another highly aggressive and domineering ape, shares over 99%. It turns out that not only Humans and other apes have DNA, all of life, has this thing called DNA. The DNA is a code that contains traits. Traits which benefit survival, go forward. Traits which hurt survival, go away. We evolved a set of traits that perfects the concept of domination, called psychopathy. Psychopathy is probably **not** what you think it is. Think of a psychopath. Close your eyes, visualize it, or one. If you thought of someone who looked evil, or even could be seen doing evil, or maybe someone in prison attire, you've failed this little test. But don't worry, this is an extremely common problem. Psychopathy is the phenotype(The expression of genes in behavior, influence over environment, etc) which contains the traits: Domination, Callousness\/Lack of empathy, Charm, and Manipulation\/Deception. It's those last ones, manipulation, deception and charm, which serve to **mask** the really nasty ones. The *perfection* of these traits results in meaningful psychopathy. What does perfection mean? It means it cannot be detected. What does the *perfection* of stick insect camouflage mean? It means a predator cannot know the stick insect is there. The stick insect mates, and passes their superior genes to their children. A psychopath functions the same way, and the set of traits which are perfected here, are simply the best system for ascending human hierarchy. So when you think of someone like Ted Bundy, or the Christian Bale character, or some other \"cartoonish\" representation of psychopathy, know that a higher form exists, you simply can't see it, because if you did, it wouldn't be a higher form. But much like the idea of \"Dark Matter\" in physics, we can predict the existence of something while being unable to see it. If you're the king of psychopaths, you're the **king** of humanity, all through the power of DNA. The hardest part for people to admit is, we're all psychopaths to some degree. Everyone thinks they're better than everyone else, that they're genuinely nice, that they're not a bad person - but this is a trick of the ego. We evolved to lie to ourselves, this is precisely one of the mechanisms which gives strong psychopathy it's power - you are at an evolutionary advantage if you can believe your **own** lies, because then your lies are **truly** foolproof - you cannot show signs of deception that way. We don't really have strong empathy, because the ancestors we had were some tough, mean apes. Altruism is a little trick apes and some other animals invent to add another layer of \"game-ness\" to the natural selection game, but no one plays this game better than psychopaths. Many apes were murdered, died childless, or were simply dominated because a clever psychopathic ape abused the idea of altruism. No one benefits more from altruism than a psychopath, because again, perfected psychopathy is the fast lane to the throne of of your society, and all of Earth.\n\nContinued below...","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559794932,"distinguished":null,"edited":1559796024,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eq58ba4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bx8xs4","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_bx8xs4","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/bx8xs4\/you_dont_despise_your_job_you_despise_capitalism\/eq58ba4\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1568969004,"score":4,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

This experiment works for any unconscious system. Simply imagine an alien race who was completely different from humanity. They were genuinely kind, genuinely benevolent, and very intelligent. Just think of an absolutely angelic species. An approximation of their behavior would be to constantly do the right thing and promote wellbeing for all life. The test of a member of this species would purely be judged by how much good they could do, and anyone who failed would never be ridiculed, but highly encouraged and you would see success stories constantly as the entire species worked to lift itself up, and anything they came across.\n\nNow imagine how such a species would function under capitalism - simply an economic model that says acquire profit. How would it differ, from the way human beings function under capitalism? I don't want to tell you the answer, I want you to really take a few minutes and think about what this difference would look like, and why the difference would exist.\n\nYou can run this test with anything, by the way. Here's another similar kind of test: Imagine if on Earth, humans retained a population of 8 billion, but with a crucial difference - all the technology we know to exist, doesn't. The only technology that exists, are hammers and nails. We don't even have knives or saws or screwdrivers. It's just hammers and nails. Our houses really suck, because we need to break the planks to build them somehow. We cook food on sticks, we boil water in stoneware carved out by our hammers, etc.\n\nBut everything else remains. Humans are the same creature they are now. What would all our violence look like? Well, to say we'd have a lot of hammer murder, would be an understatement, right? Psychopaths would nail people to trees. Blunt force trauma would be the number 1 cause of murder in such a world. But now imagine the prevalence of the belief that hammers are responsible for all of this. Look at all the hammer murder! If you just ban hammers, all of this murder goes away! It's so obvious.\n\nBut we know hammers aren't actually causing the murder, right? Hammers are a tool. How would the benevolent alien species I described earlier, use hammers differently from humanity?

It's true that every idea exists on it's own, conceptually. Mathematics is the simplest such system. 2+2=4 regardless if there is a brain or consciousness in existence to appreciate such a fact. The conceptual, economic system we call \"Capitalism\", exists the same way, defining certain variables, most importantly, money, and describes the totality of what can be called \"Capitalism\".\n\nIt's true that to practice capitalism, you probably need social relations, so I don't particularly dispute that.\n\nOn your accusation that I'm engaging in 'Commodity fetishism', first, from Wikipedia:\n\n&gt;In Karl Marx's critique of political economy, commodity fetishism is the perception of the social relationships involved in production not as relationships among people, but as economic relationships among the money and commodities exchanged in market trade. As such, commodity fetishism transforms the subjective, abstract aspects of economic value into objective, real things that people believe have intrinsic value.[1]\n\nWe can dismiss this because I do view the relationships involved in production as relationships among people. Secondly, there is no part of my argument that puts commodities on the pedestal that Marx worried about when he coined this term. You've shot into darkness with this accusation, because this isn't a problem for the argument I was putting forward, which I don't see addressed by you really. I shall restate my argument for you in fewer words than before:\n\nThe argument is that DNA naturally produces strategies which forgo ethics, because playing by the rules(Rules emerge in social scenarios) will always be an inferior adaptation to breaking the rules overtly when there are no consequences in order to gain dominance and power(which always result in the best pickings for passing genes on), and most importantly, *appearing* to play by the rules, but really flexibly and strategically breaking rules, to gain dominance and power(Which again, give you the best odds for the best babies.) This process has been slowly churning for hundreds of millions of years.\n\nThis process produces psychopathy, and better and better forms of psychopathy, which manifests from a set of genes which create the most *perfected forms*(crucial concept to understand) of the phenotypes: Domination, Callousness\/Lack of empathy, Self-Absorption, Charm, Manipulation, Deception. There is no superior strategy to dominating other apes, than this strategy. It is like cheating in a video game. You just win. It's like a school of great white sharks in a massive salt lake full of an endless supply of salmon. The salmon simply lose. They won't be eradicated, of course. That would be problem for the sharks. But they certain won't out-shark the sharks. You can probably give the salmon a million years, and they still won't out-shark the sharks.\n\nThese are the odds for ever winning a game against the people who dominate the world today. No economic system change is ever going to fix this disparity. This is why by the way, every single attempt at non-capitalist society, was a failure. The ideologue here is forced to look at things in terms of ideology. \"It was colonialism\/imperialism\/capitalism.\" Terrible things, with terrible consequences, no doubt, but they're only terrible because of **who** was doing it. All of these things could exist in contexts that are **no where** near as bad as what human beings did. Again, the ideology here invites such a toxic, obscurantist narrative because it's forced to scapegoat a poltergeist - something that is neutral in principle. Is murder bad? Well... that depends. Who is doing it? What is the context? Really anyone with any philosophical sophistication can think of exceptions almost any action human beings deem awful. And that's because, context, specifically, the motives of the actors and parties involved, and the consequences of the actions, really do sum up a broad chunk of the ethical payload here.\n\nNotice what happens when you simply put on the philosophical glasses I ask you to, and we analyze all attempts at Marxism and Communism in history. Well, they failed sure, but it's obvious now why: DNA ruins everything. The most dominant, manipulative, charming psychopaths become leaders, and exploit everything for their gain and quest to dominate even more. It's just that simple. No system will solve the secret problem within DNA, which almost no one appears to appreciate, because everyone is so busy scapegoating something - a race, a gender, a religion, a political extreme, a social phenomenon, some\/all technology, etc. It's just *not* that simple.

There are only so many things someone would be on truly firm ground to take for granted, and these things are along the lines of consciousness, concepts like mathematics, and so on. The idea that the reality narrative some clothed apes converge on is true, is very far from grounded. That being said, I'm assuming you're asking facetiously to deride me, but I'll answer your question at face value:\n\nGiven how crucial artificial intelligence and machine learning will be to those who will ultimately win the homo sapiens era domination game, the utility of armchair intellectuals who sit around and vomit onto the internet whatever memes their minds produce is significant, because by simply existing, these sorts of people are programming artificial intelligence and machines which learn from their behavior. They are especially important because they act as a kind of schizophrenic meme soup, to be skimmed for useful morsels. Paranoid schizophrenia isn't exactly a scientific methodology - it's like marijuana induced psychosis, constant apparently interesting ideas which may or may not be true. Mostly the latter, but psychosis and paranoia are interesting in that they are similar to how a broken clock is correct twice per day. Psychosis and paranoia are correct much less than this, but when they're correct, **boy** are they correct. The accidental nature here is almost entirely irrelevant here. To demonstrate this, simply imagine the craziest scenario you could think of. The craziest plot twist to reality. Let's just agree upon something at random... the first thing that enters my mind is an insect like superintelligence parasitized human consciousness thousands of years ago, and has been covertly ruling our species to perfection through sophisticated mind control while being completely undetected. Surely, this is completely insane.\n\nBut let's just assume this is along the lines of what J. B. S. Haldane meant when he said, \"Reality is not only stranger than we suppose but stranger than we *can* suppose.\"\n\nThis is it. This is reality. This is the big plot twist(for the sake of argument). And not only does no one know, no one can know. Even if one person discovers this through sheer, schizophrenic paranoid hallucination - no one will believe them. Yet imagine what the conscious experience is like for someone who truly believes this. The thought really didn't emerge from any kind of rational or intellectually rigorous process. It was a random, insane thought. It also happened to be **true**. Because it's true, a lot of things suddenly make sense. The strange struggle of life suddenly makes total sense(And unlike it making sense in other contexts, in this context it makes sense **and** is true). Other truths unknown to us now, are suddenly clear. There's nothing in principle preventing this vision of reality from slowly turning from a product of paranoid delusion, and reverse engineering itself into a highly rational, highly lucid, and totally logical representation of the world - indeed, the most logical, lucid, and rational representation of the world, by definition.\n\nAll armchair philosophers, as you would probably put it, are simply generating information by these kinds of 'schizophrenic-like' means, collectively, and it's simply a matter of fact that this data is precious. This is information being stored, and used. Used to create profiles of every single human being on earth. Used to train algorithms. Used for profit, to target ads. And most important, used to train Artificial Intelligence. This is of course all on top of the utility that all citizens have, which is, tax paying, consuming, ad targets, and so on. But this is not unique to quasi-intellectuals, so I've answered your question only in the specific context of what sets these people apart from citizens who are less defined by how much information\/information quality they produce.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559814225,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eq5u4ps","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bx6tf2","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eq5qhho","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/bx6tf2\/high_likelihood_of_human_civilization_coming_to\/eq5u4ps\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1568979270,"score":0,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

E.g., suppose that aliens have watch over the Earth and they beam people away for euthanasia as they get older, something universal and predictable just like natural old age death. And suppose the aliens had planted humans on Earth just for this purpose. Is that better than Earth being an empty world? To me, it seems like it is better. I would rather live on such a world than have no life at all. \n\nI don't think you've weighed the suffering on the planet against whatever wellbeing makes you nostalgic about life on Earth here in a serious or rigorous way. If you examine life, you'll see on a whole, immense suffering. Endless drudgery. A history of barbarism. A child will be raped by the time I finish writing my post, and a child or more, was raped during the time you wrote yours. Life just isn't that great for most people, even the most privileged people on Earth have to deal with a great deal of unhappy scenarios which they are forced to ignore and throw into the abyss of their minds. But this is really the best case scenario. The average scenario is simple misery. The vast majority of workers are miserable. Life is struggle, filled with abuse, domination, bullying, war, disease, boredom, anxiety, depression, unhealed childhood trauma, in a world which is almost engineered to create suffering, as a byproduct of DNA rolling the dice and constantly replicating and creating superior domination systems which are incentivized to not play by any rules or adapt to only superficially appear to play by rules, because such tricks are advantageous\/adaptive.\n\nAll of this alone, makes it unethical to continue the game of life. But if you add aliens into the mix, and say Earth is just a massive farm for some extraterrestrial slaughterhouse and no one knows it, that is a true hellish scenario no matter how it's framed. Nothingness was superior even without the aliens, but with the aliens, you've created a truly sinister, hellish world. A world where [Elisabeth Fritzl](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OVmhZsjDT58) was raped and imprisoned and forced to bear children in confusion, pain, and squalor for over 20 years, because aliens have a penchant for human flesh. A world where [Institutional Animal Hell](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=4391) and the [Meat Grinder of Nature](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=19), and the [rape of children by the worst monsters](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=985) exist because of some unconsciously generated food chain hierarchy?\n\nAnd this is all acceptable, why? Because you enjoy sex? You enjoy food? You enjoy watching comedies and dramas on Netflix and HBO? You enjoy your friends? Family? Drugs? Reading? Hard work, progress? Epiphany?\n\nOr because aliens enjoy the taste of intelligent apes?\n\nI'm fairly certain the victims of this hellscape would prefer non-existence than to experience what they did, and it's only through pure ignorance and poverty of experience that someone thinks otherwise. We have lot of bias [working against us](https:\/\/foundational-research.org\/against-wishful-thinking\/) to obscure and downplay the dark elements of our reality -- indeed, it is maladaptive to see reality as it is, because a creature that is blindly optimistic has by definition an increased chance of survival(Even if it's delusional).","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559815561,"distinguished":null,"edited":1559817155,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eq5vs41","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bwt1qi","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_bwt1qi","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/bwt1qi\/defeating_the_what_about_humans_argument_for\/eq5vs41\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1568980051,"score":5,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I highly suspect it serves a social engineering purpose, otherwise it would not be so prevalent. The fact that the modern apocalyptic meme of the 21st century is scaffolded with science, in a world where the most dominant, elite social engineers of western civilization are powerful enough to orchestrate such a meme through a 50+ year plan, doesn't really solve the question for me, and I suspect is at best, a prime opportunity. \n\nThere is always something to fear in sight, if you pay close attention. Even in the recent years. In the year 2000 it was Y2K - this was an engineered meme, and much economic movement occurred as a result of it, we have every reason to believe. There is a reason this absolutely flooded our realities. In 2012, it was the Mayan Calendar Apocalypse. Now, it's far more concrete, but if you simply think deeply about the utility of these apocalyptic memes and how they are **useful** to the Kings and Queens, the modern apocalyptic narrative will have deeper meaning than any science can substantiate or falsify - because the Kings and Queens dictate what science gets done and what science doesn't.\n\nWhen you can create fear in people, you can determine how they will behave in economic terms. When the coasts are going to flood, you can make massive profits by using models from expected behavior - and fear is a very reliable driver, which is why the few people on the planet Earth that own and control Media, tend to invest heavily in fear.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559827160,"distinguished":null,"edited":1559827351,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eq6djd4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bx8pnu","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eq4bt89","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bx8pnu\/idk_if_this_is_the_right_sub_but_anyone_else\/eq6djd4\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1568988458,"score":-4,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Money and prices and the market and so on are products of class struggle, and they are class struggle themselves.

But to me it's fairly clear the answers are not straightforward as with much of reality. I think the first thing is to see the usefulness of categorizing humanity into those who have the power and wealth to engage in long term engineering of society, and those who do not, and to ask what sort of evolutionary traits allowed for the ascension to this power and wealth. \n\n'Conspiracy' is a loaded term at this point. It is impossible to speculate about conspiracy and not immediately lose all credibility, which is an interesting phenomenon in itself, worth deeply examining. Who benefits from such a meme? At face value, society gets to avoid paranoia, certainly a win, but I think there's likely a non-zero sum element here, because things which are good to society don't simply manifest very easily unless there's a tremendous benefit to the most important, powerful, and influential people alive. This is all despite the reality of rampant conspiracy throughout history.\n\nI think the single most useful intellectual device we have today is the concept of North Korea. Simply create a macrocosm out of North Korea, where only it exists or perhaps has the influence of the entire developed West combined, and plug in various phenomenon that occur in our seemingly non-Dystopian society. How does the taboo of paranoia and conspiracy fare, in North Korea? Well, a large subset of well intentioned, faithful North Koreans certainly don't get to fall prey to paranoid delusions. But the idea that North Korea is a dystopian hell, and not the greatest country on Earth, who all other nations send tributes to out of admiration, is a paranoid delusion **within** North Korea.\n\nWho benefits the *most* from a taboo on conspiracy and paranoia in North Korea?","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559838176,"distinguished":null,"edited":1559839382,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eq6zsx9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bx6tf2","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eq6qjxe","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/bx6tf2\/high_likelihood_of_human_civilization_coming_to\/eq6zsx9\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1568998969,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Each of these things is substantially more\/less likely than the others.\n\nThat said, there's a kind of perspectival bias, among many other sub-baises, which we can be sure that we're all suffering from, because It's almost certain that we are poised to reject the most sinister truths about our reality that are currently unknown for various psychological and evolutionary reasons. The degree of this sinister truth is also unknown, but it's no coinflip. Unfortunately, if we live in a de facto dystopia, this most sinister truth is unfalsifiable using any rigorous method, but we can still get something useful out of examining only the facts of our reality. There is an endless web of fun facts to be discovered related to humanity, all of which, independently, can be met with \"So what?\", and collectively, can be met with \"That sounds like a paranoid conspiracy to me.\" The subject is simply a dead end, so instead, the only thing I can really say is consider what a perfected psychopathy looks like, and where such people would be positioned, and what sort of selection game occurs in the most influential positions in the world, and what these sorts of people *enjoy* doing. We live in a world where [animals are brutally exploited and tortured](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3552), but also a world where people are brutally exploited and tortured, and given rest insofar as it allows for the illusion of a non-dystopian world - a powerful boon to a psychopathic elite. This exploitation and torture is very difficult to see with the naked eye, because we're simply not *present* to this suffering. So we're forced to piece together a puzzle.\n\nThe CEO of AT&amp;T, when asked about his father's huge cattle business, and if \"he was interested in that business, or did [he want] to get out of that business?\" proudly says that he was a Animal Husbandry major, alongside another prominent [captain of industry](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/T._Boone_Pickens). \n\nThis information in a context that has a text-book definition(Ted Bundy), or media driven caricature(Christian Bale's movie character), of psychopathy simply misses the plot. Psychopathy involves(but not exclusively) the following traits: 1) social savvy\/charm 2) domination 3) callousness 4) manipulation\/deception 5) cunning. When these traits are inferior, you get someone like Ted Bundy. You get someone who gets arrested. This is the natural equivalent of a stick insect who is killed by a predator because it's camouflage was insufficient. When these traits are perfected however, such as the greatest great white shark, or the apex lions of the totality of lion hierarchy, these people become practically invisible as far as their true nature, and simultaneously all powerful. There's really no bigger adaptation in evolutionary terms. You've simply won the game, and you pass this win onto your children, and only a superior psychopath will dethrone you. Here is where the propaganda of myth and story serve to confuse us. We're all taught as children that there are heroes, and villains. But the closer we examine reality, we can discover that it is the villains who win after all. The strongest people win. And the strongest people are psychopaths, because not playing by the rules while simultaneously appearing to play by them, bending them, pretending to follow them, breaking them when it's convenient, etc, is the strongest game theoretical move for the most dominant human being. These \"strong\" people, get to win, historically. They then re-write history, and proclaim who the heroes are, to be taught as propaganda to school children, along with mythology or cartoons about good vs. evil, and the forces of good winning in some happy ending. But this is a naive fantasy - this is not how our world works, or how nature works.

What I see is complex determinism that results from gradations of conscious&lt;-&gt;unconscious actions with both intended and unintended causes\/effects\/byproducts as an expression of an evolutionary behavior\/strategy game, manifesting itself as illusory chaos(if we're simply looking at the soup of thought, behavior, action, etc.). Humans are the most difficult thing to predict, and they're not that difficult at all. Nature is far more predictable, and not a significant problem if you're one of the most influential people on Earth(The sort of person who neither of us can even put a name to, because that's a likely quality of being such a person). Asian cultures were probably most clever here, as they seem to have invented the notion of the puppet Emperor, who serves as a distraction and potential scapegoat. Is this strategy used in modern politics? We can't be sure.\n\nI'm certainly not suggesting the most dominant and influential people on the planet have a God-like ability to manipulate reality. Not yet, at least, since there is nothing in principle within the laws of Physics that prevents something very much like this, given the proper [technological sophistication](https:\/\/thumbs.gfycat.com\/CommonDistortedCormorant-mobile.mp4) + time, and the fact that those who attempt to engineer and dominate reality have always had a technological and social upper hand in the world.\n\nRe: Veganism + Psychopathy: I see what you're attempting to do here, so I'll bite the bullet and say there is really nothing about veganism that is incompatible with psychopathy or any anti-social personality disorder. There are some prominent vegan youtubers who often exhibit such behavior. There are certainly gradations of psychopathy, and there are certainly vegans who are quite far away from apex psychopaths(but the fact is, the link between psychopathic baboons, and psychopathic chimpanzees, and psychopathic humans, is not only our psychopathic DNA(91% identical to baboons, 99%+ identical to Chimpanzees, which manifests itself on an apparently broad spectrum, but I want to talk about this more later), but the fact that apes like these, and ourselves, have been playing an incomprehensibly long selection game. Those highly sensitive to psychopathic abuse, fell victim to it. They did not survive. There simply does not exist and Anti-psychopathic adaptive strategy that is **not** anti-social in some way - the best and most benign of which would be the avoidant strategy, but this is still anti-social.\n\n The pre-civilization story was not one of the noble savage, it was one of cruel struggle against monsters, and the incentives to become a monster in order to not get enveloped by the other monsters. Indeed, this is still the [modern story](https:\/\/chinaview.wordpress.com\/2007\/03\/29\/list-of-china-modern-torture-methods-photo\/) of our era, if we look at the Cultural Revolution of China and it's aftershock. As they were forced to realize that the western approach of maximized psychopathy was not going to win the long game, China had a choice to make: Perish to the conqueror psychopaths of the west, or perfect psychopathy in their country by selecting out the least psychopathic members of it's species, and killing any ideology that was poorly adapted to psychopathy. They didn't simply approach this problem as: \"Okay, unfortunately, we're the good guys, they're the bad guys, but we're in a moral quandary. As much as it hurts, we must peacefully euthanize our kindest members in order to survive\" in some kind of consequentialist or utilitarian move for the greater good. They said no such thing. They began to torture and persecute every memetic matrix and genetic carrier of said memes that involved goodness, compassion, kindness, meaningful spirituality, peace, and they did so with sadism that rivaled the Spanish Inquisition. This sort of behavior **comes naturally** to those apes who ascend to the top, because the entire machine is built to **survive**, and that includes the concept \"Defeat your enemies to survive\". By creating a culture of torture, they created a culture of psychopathy. And that is why China stands to this day, and was able to finally put an end to the constant assault it endured from the Opium wars and various other assaults, with only Hong Kong as the would-be casualty.\n\n Perhaps there were ancient cultures, or not so ancient cultures, who reject these psychopathic ideas. Perhaps some of these cultures still exist, as token decorations in a world dominated by the the most ruthless, but crucially, most deceptive apes nature produced. That's not to say outliers don't exist, but this outlier strategy is simply either begging to get dominated by the superior strategy(As hundreds of millions at minimum have been dominated and removed from the genetic and memetic game), or allowed to exist as irrelevant and non-threatening entities, which help sustain an obscured version of reality. This is probably something like the [Inuit](https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/goatsandsoda\/2019\/03\/13\/685533353\/a-playful-way-to-teach-kids-to-control-their-anger) or other peripheral peoples, but if I were to guess, I would say there's more than enough psychopathy to spare genetically, if you simply create the right circumstances to turn the genes on. I could be wrong here.\n\nReturning to DNA, the spectrum here is really important to understand. If I'm saying everyone is a psychopath because that's what evolution favored(and altruism is merely a game co-opted by the most deceptive psychopaths), aren't I simply defining psychopathy away? This is a common critical line of thinking I come across, and the answer is not necessarily. Here I make the analogy to intelligence. Intelligence exists on a continuum, and we have a feeling that we're truly grounded when we say someone\/something is high or low intelligence. We can point to rock and confidently say, \"That has no intelligence.\" We can point to a termite and say \"Perhaps there's... some intelligence there?\" And then we move a few spaces and point to rats, elephants, and us. But surely we're not all intelligent, are we? We wouldn't be defining away intelligence if we called humanity \"Intelligent apes\" in such a context, first of all. You can be correct in such a statement. Secondly, even if you arrange all human beings alive today, plotting them on a perfected continuum of intelligence, or perhaps a perfected intelligence matrix if you wanted a more fine tuned mapping, you still would only have a narrow view of what intelligence is. Because again we suffer from a kind of perspectival ignorance here, we cannot imagine what a thing that is a trillion times more intelligent than a human being is, how it functions, what the experience of being such a thing is like, etc. Yet we know rock bottom intelligence - rocks, as it happens. Here we have a firm footing. It's the other direction of the continuum where we get lost.\n\nWith Psychopathy, we simply have no firm footing in either direction - just hints. What would a superhuman psychopathy be like? Would it simply be added intelligence? Have we maximized sadism and a lack of empathy, or does it get worse? It probably gets worse, is my guess, but it's hard to really know. Does a human with with absolutely **not** empathy exist? Probably in some context, at least. Just hints. No firm footing here. And the other side of the spectrum? This is **truly** nebulous. Since we descend from a brutal, amoral selection game that only manifests ethics in purely superficial terms(this isn't to suggest that ethics don't matter by the way) which get exploited by the fittest survival+domination machines who fight against other survival+domination machines, we **truly** struggle to imagine what a perfected benevolence appears like. A true moral sophistication. A true commitment to valuing the experience of other conscious things. A true commitment to kindness. A true commitment to reducing suffering in a way that makes a mockery out of any comic book character or fictional\/mythological hero that the **entirety** of humanity has mustered. Here is where I suspect our imaginations truly fail us. We are the simultaneous victims and perpetrators of the unconscious crimes resulting from the tragic dynamic between DNA and natural selection.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559852705,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eq7szgi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bx6tf2","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eq7ijvm","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/bx6tf2\/high_likelihood_of_human_civilization_coming_to\/eq7szgi\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1569013441,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I would take a more radical approach than this author, and say that art is ultimately a conceptual system, confined to some body of information. This conceptual system may well be as infinite as the totality of all information and all combinations of arrangement of said information, but much of this information involves real descriptions. Take surrealism, for example. As it's name suggests, surrealism tries to depict an art that is real enough to resemble reality, yet absurd enough to clearly not resemble reality. Can we call minimalist paintings surrealist? Well, there is probably *some* room for overlap, but generally no. Art is a series of axioms in this way, existing in a conceptual framework in precisely the same way that mathematics exists in a conceptual framework.\n\nNow, I can already feel the discomfort and scoffing of some of the readers of that sentence, but this is far more flexible than it appears. If someone's painting was clearly photorealistic, there's still room there to apply surrealist axioms, and these axioms would truly make sense. Perhaps there's even room for photorealistic art to be surrealist *and* minimalist - but still, we're dealing with real properties and quantities here. You'll struggle to call a super complex and rich painting with high variability, a \"minimalist\" painting. But perhaps simply critiquing the art this way is a form of art? To what degree? The axioms of art allow for superposition -- the simultaneity of the absolute absurd and absolute non-absurd, these are no problem for the axioms of art. There's even an axiom for complete gibberish in describing art, **as** art.\n\nI feel like I've laid out my case, so now I'll touch on what I found to be unproblematic for art:\n\n&gt;There are many theories that work against the idea of art being knowledge. Descartes\u2019s emphasis on knowledge as \u201cclear and distinct\u201d ideas, and John Dewey\u2019s assertion that art is \u201cdistinctively aesthetic\u201d with its own \u201cintegrity\u201d that lifts it above knowledge, are just two examples. \n\nSo far we've come pretty close to clear and distinct ideas. I use the word axioms but you could also say, \"Rules with exceptions\" or \"Complex rules\". There are two ways to see the description, one as fluid and flexible, and the other as entirely rigid in it's totality. Both are true. I ultimately don't think there's anything different about the total,  conceptual description of art, and the total, conceptual description of mathematics. So I agree with Descartes, but don't think this is a problem for art that is truly vast and seemingly fluid - if you want to be truly finicky here, you could say the fluidity is the illusion which unfathomable complexity creates. As for Dewey, all one needs is more caveats and axioms, and anything becomes distinctively aesthetic(or lacking in aesthetic) *without* losing distinctiveness. This is what complex rules achieve, like I attempted to describe with Surrealism. Even a lack of distinction, is fully compatible as a distinctive property of art.\n\nThe hardest claim here to swallow is the \"Superpositional\" nature of the theory of art I put forward. If some art is simultaneously aesthetic and non-aesthetic, then it must not be distinctive. This is only true in the broadest sense, it still retains a distinctive quality if you simply take a finer-grained approach to conceptualizing qualities of aesthetics. These systems function on their own just fine, even without the \"broadest sense\" interpretation.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559854763,"distinguished":null,"edited":1559857951,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eq7x47o","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bxhf2c","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_bxhf2c","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/bxhf2c\/knowledge_can_take_many_forms_one_of_them_is_art\/eq7x47o\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1569015442,"score":7,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Beyond the most obvious answer to me, which is that any philosopher worth their salt recognizes humanity's penchant for bias and rejection of new, controversial, or ideologically\/representatively threatening ideas -- we could expect that some ideas could be too dangerous to express clearly. Dangerous to the philosopher, and even dangerous to the student of philosophy.

If everyone tries to solve their problems through figuring out what the right thing to do is, the good guys (who are right) will have an easier time proving themselves to be right than the bad guys (who are wrong). Finding and using asymmetric weapons is the only non-coincidence way to make sustained moral progress.\n\nWhat is meant by Reason here? Can we use a broad, contextual definition, or are there better words to talk about what I'm about to describe? I'm using the following definition:\n\n\"*Reason is the capacity for consciously making sense of things, establishing and verifying facts, applying logic, and changing or justifying practices, institutions, and beliefs based on new or existing information.*\"\n\nPsychopathy is a system that comes about through natural selection, containing the phenotypes Domination, Callousness\/Lack of empathy, Charm\/Social savvy, Deception\/Manipulation among others. It is a strategy to attain power by not playing by the rules of society. It is flexible, in that it can appear to play by the rules in order to not play by the rules. It can break the rules when it's convenient, or it can pretend to play by the rules, or it can divert attention, when accused of rule breaking to attack the accuser. It's reasonable from the point of view of psychopathy to *not* play by the rules. It's unreasonable from the point of view of someone who actually holds some sort of ethics or morality that values the meaningfully positive experience of others, and wishes to minimize the suffering of others, and follows rules that involve such behavior as a result.\n\nPsychopathy is a meta weapon when it comes to the weapon of Reason here, and can be used to argue that Reason is asymmetric but in the *other* direction. It favors the rule breaker, because there's a real advantage in things like causing damage versus repairing it. The one bound by rules could be endlessly reasonable, but the advantages achieved by the psychopath always give them the upperhand, because rule breaking, in a game where it is *advantageous* to skillfully break rules, is just... well... advantageous. If all else is equal, you can't win, and there's a constant feedback loop when it comes to advantage - once you have advantages, more advantages arise from your advantages.\n\nThe problem in parsing all of this is that psychopathy doesn't appear reasonable to the non psychopathic, and vice versa, but in the operational context I don't think this is a problem, and it's not even useful to say a psychopath is unreasonable here in the same sense that it's not useful to tell a militia who kidnapped you and plans to torture you is being unreasonable -- You've simply lost the game at this point.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559911678,"distinguished":null,"edited":1559911881,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eq9m7cm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bxr0f7","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_bxr0f7","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/bxr0f7\/asymmetric_weapons_gone_bad\/eq9m7cm\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1569044189,"score":5,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

To your current self, positive experiences are **worth** creating. This is a perfectly intuitive position, almost everyone has made this assumption. It sounds **obvious**. Right?\n\nBut Benatar says, there's actually something *better* than creating good experiences. That better thing is **nonexistence**. Here's another way to frame the problem:\n\nWhen you think of the **ultimate** goodness, what comes to mind? Something incomprehensibly good, I'm sure. But let's instead take a step back and first define what attribute would be required of something that we could call **ultimate** goodness. The **perfection** of goodness.\n\nWhatever this thing is, it would by definition, need to be perfectly **immune** to suffering. The place where the \"suffering\" variable is undefined, or where there is room for it to squeeze in, or where there is room for torture, or where there is even room for a descent into hell, none of these things can be **ultimate** goodness. There's room for goodness, sure, but not ultimate goodness. Ultimate goodness can be defined as the perfection of immunity to badness, it is a negative condition. Nothing can be more good than that as long as you appreciate that the implication is a \"checkmate\" against the worst suffering. And that *perfected* negative condition(absence of suffering) is non-existence.\n\nNotice how interesting this becomes when we contrast it with ultimate suffering. Can ultimate suffering be the *perfection* of an immunity to wellbeing? Kind of, but not if we're being extremely careful, because then this sort of sounds nonsensical - we can think of countless scenarios that create an immunity to wellbeing but *aren't* the ultimate suffering. Because a lack of goodness isn't necessarily bad. Badness is a positive condition - it says *something* is happening by definition. We would be correct to say: \"It's **good** that a child isn't getting raped in the house next door to us.\"(Goodness is a negative condition here) But it doesn't have the same weight to say, \"It's **terrible** that someone isn't having a spiritual epiphany in the house next door to us.\"(Badness is a **positive** condition). It's simply just... \"Yeah, it's a shame, I *guess*. I'm not going to lose sleep over it.\" Right?\n\nI said this was a value problem, but only in the loose sense.

A lightbulb went off for me when I was listening to Jon Haidt pitch his \"Big 5 personality traits correlate with liberal\/conservative views\" research, and I just thought, \"What personality trait(s), or psychological attribute(s), could possibly result in a rejection of free will, or an acknowledgement that it doesn't exist? And then it was clear.\n\nThere are a few similar reasons. Ego. Existentional fear(This is *essentially* ego, it's heavily related to fear of the sensation of your own mortality or the morality of some cherished model of representation you deeply and fundamentally associate with). Narcissism.\n\nWhat does someone have to **lose** when they are presented the idea that they don't actually make themselves, and are therefore not free? Their pride, for starters. Pride no longer makes sense in that **same** self-absorbed \"I **earned** my superiority to you\" way than it did before. People often take this to an absurd nihilistic conclusion - if they can no longer be extremely proud and in the same breath, deride someone else for 'choosing' to be lesser than them, then nothing matters anymore, we can no longer lock up axe murderers, and so on. This is a completely nonsensical reduction.\n\nBut a lot is at stake, psychologically. Revenge goes out the window. You can no longer **blame**. A lot of retributive and sadistic impulses become clearer character flaws, because now you're not \"punishing the bad guy\", you're just another asshole. We are ego-driven animals, and for good reason - this is what allowed us to survive. The ego sees the illusion of free will as an ideological threat - a force that threatens to *kill* said ego, the ego that has kept our ancestors alive. This is a **big** deal.\n\nSo that's the hypothesis. I'm not a scientist, so that's my disclaimer, but this shouldn't be terribly hard. Quantify for some combination of egomania\/self-absorption\/or simply narcissism(edit this to the satisfaction of scientific standards), quantify detachment from the self(Again, you may have to parse the language here into something more scientific if necessary), and then poll for belief in free will, and I think you'll have some interesting correlations.

What are you trying to say here? I'm open to being convinced. If you see some evidence of free will, please, I invite you for the third time, to put it forward. You appear very curiously invested in attacking the proposition that free will is an illusion. \n\n&gt;This is a laughably poor strawman. Pretty much the ONLY people who define free will in that manner are the least intellectually honest of its opponents.\n\nWell no, this is Libertarian Free Will. And there are... let's count...  a conservative estimate would be 21 million subscribers to the idea that we are *truly* free.\n\n&gt;Most who hold to the position that some form of free will exists readily accept that there are notable constraints on the exercise of will. In point of fact, there's an entire set of theories - compatibilism - that's based on exactly that understanding - that causation appears to be sound but is nonetheless compatible with the existence of free will.\n\n&gt;Anyone who asserts that a particular thing is a matter of fact has a burden of proof - it doesn't matter in the slightest if that nominal fact is presented in the form of a positive (X exists) or a negative (X does not exist). The instant that one asserts that any particular thing is the case, one is making a declaration about the nominally certain state of reality, and thus must be able to provide evidence to support the assertion. If they do not have such evidence or if the evidence fails to fully support the assertion, then the claim that the assertion is factually true fails, and again, entirely regardless of whether the assertion is framed as a positive (X exists) or a negative (X does not exist).\n\nI see you are a diehard agnostic. It's nice of you to leave your foot in the door for solipsism, I respect that ever so slightly.\n\nWhat I don't respect though, is the obsessive compulsive linguistic implications your particular philosophy demands. We must now couch every sentence about a fictional property with \"The Avengers aren't real, *or so we suspect.*\" \"The Earth isn't Flat, *as far as we know.*\"\n\nThis is a problem. So... while reasonable people would probably admit, as I would, that everything is open to revision, it is not useful to approach reality with the kind of pathological agnosticism with which you appear to. Hopefully this gets the point across. \n\nSo, to briefly humor your language game: \"Free will is an illusion, as far as I and many people can see, after closely examining the problem.\"\n\n&gt;my inclination is to believe that free will exists, simply because the experience of that which appears to be free will is essentially universal\n\nClearly not, many people reject this idea. But even if this were the case, we wouldn't want to commit argumentum ad populum when making a claim about Free Will.\n\n&gt;and the most parsimonious explanation is that the experience exists because the thing that seems to be experienced exists.\n\nWell, no. The only thing that 'the thing that seems to be experienced exists' can conclude, is that 'the thing that seems to be experienced exists'. Do you also believe that lower animals have free will? There is an experience of 'what it is' to be any given animal - the neuroanatomy is often very similar. Yet clearly you can manipulate animal behavior in such predictable ways that it's obvious that animals don't have free will. Human beings are just a more complex animal - so what makes this idea of freedom coherent in us? \"We can experience consciousness, and consciousness can't be an illusion, therefore, we can freely make choices, and free will can't be an illusion.\" The premise of this argument is necessarily true, but the conclusion does not follow.\n\n&gt; And beyond that, I actually believe that a time will come when humanity will look back on hard determinism with the same mixture of incredulity and pity with which we look back on things like diseases being caused by evil spirits and the sun being a flaming chariot being piloted through the firmament - as a painfully silly position held by dull primitives who couldn't or at least didn't manage to figure out the ultimately rather prosaic mechanisms by which the process actually works.\n\nThat's a great little anecdote, but that's not an argument for free will. \n\n&gt;But those are just suppositions - unlike you, I don't pretend to know one way or another.\n\nHopefully my clarifications on epistemology earlier in this response will make you no longer misrepresent what I actually believe, or how I believe it.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559952550,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eqbp0mc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bxx9ln","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eqbjzen","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/bxx9ln\/philosophy_shrugged_ignoring_ayn_rand_wont_make\/eqbp0mc\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1569136827,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Psychiatrists are the people who determine what is \"normal\" and what is \"insane\"(How sinister is that?). Psychology only cares about studying things like behavior, personality, intelligence, errors in thinking, etc. It certainly has it's problems as a young science, but it's nowhere near the monstrosity that psychiatry is.\n\nIntelligence is a tricky subject. I want to preface what I'm about to say with a quick idea. When I was in my early 20's, I realized that the most powerful people must by definition be deceptive and secretly engineer their citizens, after having been an insatiably inquisitive child and having examined things like the soap opera of politics as I grew up, and then read about the various escapades of military and intelligence agencies from major superpowers. The incentives are too large to not shape your society to the whims of what the kings require. This must have been happening since the dawn of civilization, in a kind of king-peasant dynamic which still must exist today.\n\nSo I wondered then: \"Why don't the kings just create a huge population of imbecile peasants? Peasants that are too stupid to understand what's going on?\" And for some reason the answer wasn't immediately obvious, but as the ruler(s), your society is sort of like your animal farm. You want your society to produce things, like milk, eggs, and so on. In this case, you want menial labor, but you also want to have Einstein. If you get Einstein before the enemy superpowers, well, then you just get nuclear weapons first and win.\n\nThis is how a ruler must think. So it's actually your **enemy** who interested in is stupefying your society **completely**, to limit your technological progress which limits your economy, intel, and military. You want a good balance of grunts and scientists if you're going to win the game. You certainly don't want a society **full** of smart people though, because then it won't be a matter of only a few people figuring out that your society is a dystopian hierarchy and that the rulers are running the show to a psychopathic degree and misleading everyone.

We are not particularly virtuous animals - and I would argue we are not particularly sophisticated in understanding what virtue really is, even after the few thousand years we've been attempting to. Perhaps a true tolerance and understanding of vices, is paradoxically a virtue? This would be something like the sensation of being an enlightened Eastern mystic or the sort of Christian who truly zeros in on only the benevolent aspects of what those teachings have to offer.\n\nBut I suspect that a truly ethical approach has to be holistic. It can't simply look at a glutton or coward and say, \"Behold, there goes a glutton\/coward. See how they gorge\/cower? Tis what gluttons\/cowards do.\"\n\nAristotle had zero grasp of genetics and a science of the mind -- he was a complete ignoramus where even middle-schoolers today would expose his ignorance here. He didn't *truly* know that people were simply products of upbringing, genes, peer-groups, parents, spacial-temporality and various other happenstances.\n\nTo moralize people this way or to simply judge someone on the basis of any given vice or virtue, is *kind* of vice in itself - or at best a kind of ethical and scientific myopia. Therefore, to be fundamentally accepting of people, **especially** your friends, in a way that takes into account the brittle nature of the way people become who they become, must be a virtue. Constantly being in a position where you can say \"This person isn't virtuous enough, I value this friend less.\" can itself be a vice that is more egregious than it may appear. Now, to avoid a looming groan-inducing reductio, I am not suggesting that we befriend axe-murderers or any other absurd conclusion. I'm just describing an approach to friendship that is less at the mercy of one's own egomania, and more in touch with the way people become the way they become.\n\n&gt;If time spent with my lazy friend tends to make me less motivated when it comes to my own life, I arguably am worse off. This can make such friends bad to us, even if unintentionally. \n\nThis sort of exposes the selfish, moralizing drive I'm talking about. While the argument is technically true, it's also true that if time spent with your lazy friend improves both of your lives in meaningful ways, perhaps your motivation isn't the pinnacle of what decides a good friendship? I think the real crux of friendship is compatibility, not some antiquated idea of what makes a person good or bad. Now, it's possible for two people to appear compatible but one clearly exploits the other -- this is not what I mean. I'm attempting to meaningfully describe friendship as the author probably is. When two people highly value each other, and this often manifests as valuing totally distinct features, and creatively adjust to their own flaws and the flaws of one another in a way that is not only well-meaning but consistently results in consequences that are acknowledged to be good for both parties-- that's what makes **good** friendship.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1560000637,"distinguished":null,"edited":1560000959,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_3":1},"id":"eqe8bn2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_by6oka","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_by6oka","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/by6oka\/good_friendships_require_a_certain_amount_of\/eqe8bn2\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1569189690,"score":181,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":1}

I realize this is unlikely in *our* world, but at the very least it's possible in principle. \n\nWe simply can't know what the consequences of birth are in the long term. If say, we find ourselves in this Roman colloseum we call Earth and decide to, rather than seriously approach the subject of improving the abhorrent conditions, take the AN\/Efilist\/VHEMT approach, this *could* have unintended, terrible consequences. Consequences for life here on Earth, where our drastic efforts in reducing suffering, paradoxically result in *increased* suffering... well then, AN\/Efilism\/VHEMT was clearly the wrong strategy in such a scenario.\n\nIf there exist hells elsewhere in the galaxy, where creatures like ourselves to some degree(high sentience\/intelligence\/etc)are doomed, and our species is not only capable of helping, but is on a deterministic crash course with being their saviors(saviors, in this context could be anything from pointing the Death Star at their planet, or destroying the torture devices, or anything in between), then it would be selfish of our species to end existence without first fixing ourselves and fixing the horror show that may be happening in the galaxy, and universe, if possible. This is the same reason why VHEMT can be criticized as selfish. Just think of the dogs we've bred to have tiny legs and flattened snouts - these animals would become helpless prey and struggle even more than they did under our \"care\". So these philosophies can sometimes imply that we allow all the animals which we've either tormented all this time, or sat helplessly by as nature tormented them, to languish on a prison planet after we say, \"Seeya, Suckers!\" Clearly not the very best move.\n\nNow, all of this is of course extremely hypothetical and idealistic. My natural frame of mind is to approach these things in a highly pessimistic and cynical way, but I have no trouble admitting that if these conditions *were* true, we are certainly capable of making some very narrow-minded errors when it comes to applying AN\/Efilism\/VHEMT, etc, and that won't be the first time where apes with clothes were narrow-minded.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1560002616,"distinguished":null,"edited":1560002976,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eqedw8p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_by14gb","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_by14gb","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/by14gb\/whats_your_best_pronatalist_argument\/eqedw8p\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1569192655,"score":5,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I don't have any personal affinity for guns, I don't think they are cool, I think they are a tremendous burden to even own with respect to how many potential problems they create for the sake of *potentially* avoiding a truly massive problem one day. I'm certainly not in any clear sense \"Pro gun\"(Or \"Anti-gun\", for that matter). That being said, I think the ultimate utility of the 2nd amendment is a fundamental change in how small scale evil and thuggery was put in check. Before firearms, it was very difficult for a true monster who was obscured in the shadows of namelessness, and only known by few, who terrorized those around them in a way that was so cunning and cold that it expertly bypassed law, to ever be challenged.\n\nAfter guns, this person was put into check. They could no longer simply be cunning villains or thugs, because their victim could be carrying, or eventually acquire, a magical device which equalizes things and says, \"I am not your victim. I am ready to sacrifice myself to stop someone as utterly detestable as you.\" The victim was simply a victim prior to guns, and evil could just run rampant. When you arm people, evil gets scared. Evil doesn't care about shooting up schools - rage, resentment, ostracism, hatred, rejection, envy, disgust, vengeance, these are the motives behind school shootings. Any real mass shooting event or overt act of violence is almost never evil. That's a confusion of what evil is. Evil, if it's even useful to call it by that word, is something more sinister, subtle, and covert. Evil shows itself with a non-threatening smile. It is a near perfect weapon system - until the gun was introduced. This posed a serious problem for evil.\n\nThe double edged sword of the second amendment is much more obvious, but the actual utility part, the actual **good** part of the second amendment I think is hardly recognized by anyone. The idea that untrained strangers could revolt against a trained military is delusional, and it's more delusional than ever in 2019. Not even the next biggest superpower can stand a chance against the biggest superpower in military terms, let alone some random militia of AR wielding hobbyists. And they certainly wouldn't turn any tides in any kind of war.

Any ideology which could conceivably romanticize \"the nation\" or specific cultural groups, or deeply believes perhaps that people(and therefore nations) are unconstrained(free) to rise or fall in a historical context through hard work or cunning or some other factor in success, or believes history is meritocratic, will be forced to either 1) reject their own beliefs 2) reject Diamond's work. Libertarians for instance cannot tolerate Diamond because aside from any nationalistic tendencies which may or may not exist, they uniformly believe that the groups(countries, states, alliances, tribes, empires, etc) who \"won\" and \"lost\" in historical terms, **really** deserved to win or lose. The groups who won history, **made** their own luck, and the countries who lost historically, reaped their poorly sown fields and earned their failure. Libertarians are not \"Alt-Right\" necessarily either, so the crucial variable is, **how do these ideas threaten the ideological beliefs of certain people and their conclusions?** \n\n&gt;Jared Diamond\u2019s thesis, in Guns, Germs, and Steel, is that regional differences in civilizational achievement are entirely caused by biogeographical factors, while regional differences in ability have had no effect. It isn\u2019t that he believes that there are no such regional differences: he argues that the populations with the fewest achievements are the most intelligent !\n\nJust look at the first two sentences of the review you linked, dripping with exasperated ideology. First of all, Diamond does **not** claim that regional differences in ability have had no effect, -- this is a complete mischaracterization. What he **does** claim, is that racist explanations for the playing out of history are false(You'd think the heavily anti-racist left would side with his work as a result, but no, such is the beauty of ideology). Second of all, no where does Diamond say he thinks the populations with the fewest achievements are the **most** intelligent -- this is absurd, again, and the author's nationalistic, meritocratic political ideology is utterly blinding them to make embarrassingly poor critiques. This wouldn't exactly be the first time such a thing has happened.\n\nThis is only a \"right-ish\" take on things. There are other motives on the \"left\" sphere, but this is why it's not useful to strictly look at political labels, and it's better to instead look at belief systems and motives, and how certain ideas threaten someone's ideology.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1560192480,"distinguished":null,"edited":1560193537,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eqotqey","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bwnjpy","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eqnamtp","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/bwnjpy\/scotts_nonfiction_recommendations\/eqotqey\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1569380857,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

The burden of engaging this way is that you ultimately are doomed to appear self-serving, even in the odd chance you aren't *meaningfully* self-serving(there are almost certainly self-serving elements to everything we think, do, say, of course). This is maybe the first thing worth pointing out - we are poised to judge things on a basis that is at the mercy of our emotions, before we hear any arguments. It doesn't even matter what those arguments are, a judgement has already been made. We can rationalize post-hoc how we were truly open, and tell ourselves things like \"Okay okay, let's hear it. This *better* be good...\" in the same breath that exhales shock, disgust, anger, bewilderment. So I'm pretty cynical to think what's really happening is total openness, but maybe it's possible. It's also unfortunate that my position is based on philosophical rather than straight forward and pragmatic styles of thinking(which are philosophical, but they also tend to be fairly normative) like \"If you know X is bad, and Y has some relationship to X, then you should avoid engaging in both Y and X.\", because this usually just adds more ammunition to confusion than anything else. The last thing to say before I begin, is to admit that I'm open to having my mind changed at all times. Either of us could be deeply confused, and I don't take that for granted for even a second. I don't believe my reasons are excellent necessarily, but also don't believe the reasons for strict veganism are excellent either, just like I don't believe the reasons for strict Antinatalism are excellent(even clearly unwise if we frame the problem in certain ways). I'm going to lay out my position, and I'll note the replies, but I'm not going to spend a ton of time defending or arguing or correcting what I read unless something truly catches my eye because this is a problem I've been re-evaluating and thinking about for several years, examining vegan youtubers, listening to what vegans have to say(largely agreeing with a lot of vegan ethics, by the way), and even engaging in various diet approaches from being vegetarian to completely vegan myself for a long period. It feels like I've familiarized myself with the arguments. That being said...\n\n\nI think the simplest way of explaining this is to argue that I can't see ethics as being contingent on acts themselves. If you fundamentally disagree here, then we have already hit a philosophical wall made of diamond. As far as I can see, ethical behaviors are contingent on 1) moral realism and 2) consequences of actions(how bad or how good the results of actions are) and to some degree, a) intentions\/descriptions of actors and the environmental states in which they act, which create immoral\/moral gradations and supplement the full picture of consequences.\n\nVeganism is a highly pragmatic strategy that says, \"I will strictly avoid eating everything that isn't plant, bacteria, or fungi to avoid harm.\" First of all, I respect this strategy. It's perfectly fine, and it **works**. That's what's great about pragmatism, if there was a catchphrase slogan for this philosophical style, it would be: \"Pragmatism: It works.\"*^^^most ^^^of ^^^the ^^^time\n\nHowever, something doesn't sit right for me with such a strategy. Surely there is a monumental difference between someone who eats nothing but cheeseburgers daily, and someone who eats nothing but linguine with clams daily. Should I care terribly that the first person is not a vegan, and then, should I care terribly that the second person is not a vegan? Neither are vegans, yet we tend to have these black and white views - \"You're **either** a vegan, or you're a part of the problem.\" Even in the worst case scenario, with factory farmed meat, which I don't tire from censuring as anyone familiar knows. This brings us to another cognitive problem with dietary ethics. A hypothetical:\n\nSuppose there existed a person who ate nothing but 5 courses of pure beef or pork on a daily basis. We would be tempted to immediately condemn such an individual as a moral monster. But what if this person intentionally championed animal ethics in such a way that had real consequences in permanently ending the majority of industrial factory farming? A common answer I expect here is \"Sure, maybe the things they did led to good outcomes, but they were still a moral monster for eating all of that meat.\" But I don't think it's that clear. From the spacial-temporal location of unforeseen consequences, you appear to be supporting an industry that promotes animal hell, but I think the consequences of eating that meat turned out to be largely irrelevant to the plot, and the consequences of the behavior and meta-behavior\/macro-behavior which resulted in industrial factory farm reform\/liquidation, to have been the moral bullseye. The intentions help us color the scenario too, but intentions seem not to matter to many vegans. There is a difference between the same person, eating meat for some benign reasoning or confusion, vs. eating meat because they personally gets an ecstatic satisfaction from animal suffering but paradoxically wants to solve the problem of factory farming \"For fun\". These are huge gradients which vegans rarely seem to care about. The final question is always, \"But are you vegan?\" I'm trying to demonstrate how much *less* the question, \"But are you vegan?\" really matters here in ethical terms.\n\nAnother example with some parallels I can think of here would be, suppose an ethics based movement began unfolding where people recognized the horror of native American displacement, domination, and genocide, which to some degree echoes even today. Every day citizens of North America spend there who are not natives, support the system which was founded on the burdens of native people. They support economies, business, they work, they fuel the memeosphere, they are complicit in the stealing of land and destruction of native peoples. \n\nSo people began leaving the country either literally or in some looser sense, to protest and say \"Never again\" to North American Society. Sure, their new society probably has some sort of transgression regarding land ownership and conquest because Earth has been a battlefield, but at least they're no longer supporting the most well known theft of landmass and total cultural genocide that is known of in the past several hundred years. How much would such behavior matter? And would the ethics really balance on the leaving vs. staying? What if someone stayed there who could conceivably move out(A moral monster, because they support the system), but had a lasting impact that chipped away at the very thing which devastated the natives of the Americas and resulted in reform which respected and promoted thriving of the natives alive today? In my eyes, this person is far more ethical than someone who simply left the country. The fact they left, almost has no value, because the consequences of their leaving didn't necessarily have the great ethical implications they thought it did. It could have, to some degree. But not **necessarily**, and as far as answering ethical questions definitely, you need a \"necessarily\".\n\nI'll end with a final point because I've already probably written too much and I know that to some degree no amount of writing is going to change minds after already admitting that I support veganism and animal ethics. The final point is the cognitive bias that occurs with precisely such scenarios. The bias sounds like this: \"You *support* veganism and animal ethics, yet would eat something that isn't a plant, bacteria, or fungi?!?! You're worse than a carnivore!\" I don't know how common this is but there's a trend of absolutism which blinds us to acknowledging ethical gradients and ethical exceptions. It's much easier to say \"All X is wrong\", which I respect as a pragmatic approach, but can't find the logic in subscribing to it. Again, the unfortunate reality here is you need an approach to philosophy for this not to appear monstrous in the same way that someone who says \"Sometimes, even raping a child could be correct in principle.\" appears monstrous without a philosophical context. I accept that burden, and instead prefer to simply tell the truth and honestly put forward my position rather than try to be avoidant.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1560214204,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eqq7ltx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bylr3n","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_bylr3n","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bylr3n\/curious_how_many_of_you_guys_are_vegan\/eqq7ltx\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1569404426,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Being in touch with reality, when reality was dark, was a bad thing, for millions of years.\n\nThe bias for optimism is encoded in us. And re-energized as we are indoctrinated as children with various Disney-like tales with happy endings, or super hero stories. There's a good guy, and a bad guy, and the world is mostly good guys, and the end is happy. This is the story we're told. And there is a reason we're told this story rather than \"Life is hell, the most cleverly selfish people on the planet who can hide their selfishness and cleverness in the most cunning way possible, dominate and enslave all of life.\"\n\nUnfortunately, natural selection, nature, etc, is not a [Disney movie](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=19). We block this part of reality, and the entirety of the [horrors](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=985) of reality for good reason - we covered this already. If you can ignore these things successfully, either willfully or subconsciously or by pretending they don't exist, you have what's called \"an adaptation\", which really anything that can help you survive. Anything that has an even 51% chance of success, can go forward, no matter how crazy, or how harmful it is. That's the world we live in. Notice how this has nothing to do with what's right or good?

Because we're machines that care about ourselves and the things which matter to us.\n\nI fully stand with you when it comes to avoiding black and white thinking - the world is extremely complex with many gradients and exceptions and subtle variables, we **can't** even wrap our minds around it.

Certainly hating the horrific circumstances of reality doesn't get us anywhere.

They don't want everyone to jump, just the people who *would* jump that are on average more useful than not. But it also depends on whose perspective we're looking at. China may want a lot of people to jump, for example(Or maybe not?). The US only wants specific people to jump, and its enemies don't want those same people to jump or don't care.  It's pretty complicated, but it's something like that.

If we had a revolutionary drug we'll call Aproblemolin, which immediately causes the person who is given it, to see all of their moral failures with clarity and gain the capacity to feel genuinely sorry about, it would not make sense to \"punish\" someone who wronged you by **not** giving them the drug. If you did a harmful act which you were too ignorant to understand the consequences of, you would feel in the company of monsters if you saw your accusers sadistically say, \"Look at TheKingOfBakas, he's not a normal person... he **deserves** not getting this treatment.\" as they slam the gates shut.\n\nEveryone you meet, who wrongs you somehow, is a potential beneficiary of this imaginary drug in principle. Treating them like they truly could have done other than what they did, or as if they are truly guilty even of endorsing your harm after the harm was done, or deserve punishment for their moral failure, is the same moral confusion as withholding the treatment to their failure as punishment. It's nonsensical, because it pretends as if people could have acted otherwise.\n\nThe reason you feel retributive urges is not because they are logical or rational, but because they had a survival benefit in your ancestors. It was an adaptive strategy to hit someone, if they hit you. Or kill their baby, if they killed yours. Because this dis-incentivized outright sociopathic behavior in social animals.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1560309561,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eqtdxl8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bzjp0s","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_eqtby80","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bzjp0s\/you_owe_them_nothing\/eqtdxl8\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1569565830,"score":29,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Additionally, do you have some pathological skepticism towards either the causes of a character trait like sadism, or the quality of experience of being a sadism(Enjoying pleasure from the suffering of others)? \n\n&gt;Imagine an egoist who always behaves purely altruistically. And because speech is an action, too, he even calls himself an altruist. You wouldn't consider such a man an egoist, even for a second, for you would have no reason to do so. Even if, after a night of drinking, he broke down and confessed that he was an egoist, who behaved altruistically only out of some purely selfish motive, you wouldn't believe he was really an egoist, but rather an altruist suffering from self-doubt and unearned guilt, exaggerating his own normal human impulses.\n\nWell first of all, that wouldn't be meaningful altruism(which I think is very rare, by the way). That would something more like pro-social psychopathy. This person would be behaving in ways that are favorable to others, **for his own benefit**. This isn't what people normally mean when they say 'altruism', and again, would not be meaningful. Such self-interested behavior would be easily exposed, and believable, because a condition like egoism is rhizomatic, it touches all aspects of someone's thoughts and behaviors. \n\n&gt;Ah, you have fallen into a false dichotomy.

It could simulate alternative states, and the descriptions of these states would fundamentally change the character of experience. These states could even be weighed against each other, much like in mathematics, where integers are weighed against each other to determine the largest or smallest integer. These states are non-identical, therefore, some states are truly better than other states.

Don't you think certain psychological attributes make one a kind of imbecile, ethically, in the same sense that certain cognitive states make one an imbecile in other intellectual or philosophical terms, like the ability to perform sophisticated mathematics, understand complex science, etc. What is your best guess on the *precise* psychological state that would by definition, make one an imbecile when it came to questions of morality?\n\n&gt; It is decided by whether you find any of the forms of bootstrapping convincing. Personally, although I am actually not a solipsist, I think it's reasonable to find the arguments against it unconvincing.\n\nThat's great, everyone ultimately does because there **are** no convincing arguments against solipsism. **That's the point** i'm making here. It's a philosophical **dead end**. You mention solipsism, and you \"win\" in a certain sense, right? But you also **lose**. That's the **end** of the game. Yeah? Do you get it yet? Everyone knows this, so they go \"Okay.. well... we can't argue against solipsism, so we have to do some bootstrapping here to **keep** playing the game, so we're not all solipsistic egomaniacal imbeciles each doubting the pervasive consciousness around us.\"\n\nThe same is true with moral anti-realism\/relativism. You cannot fundamentally escape 1) The bias of consciousness or 2) The bias of anthropocentrism or 3) The bias of egocentricity to be on firm moral ground, but this **isn't** a problem for the same reason that solipsism's firm ground isn't a problem. The difference is, solipsism is actually understood to be a moronic position to hold, but somehow, a not insignificant minority of people doing philosophy to any kind of degree, think this is okay to do with ethics. They think it's perfectly fine to just pretend as if sheer hell and misery for all things which can experience such a state, is \"not **truly**, **meaningfully** bad\". It's a pity we don't live in a world where moral anti-realists\/relativists don't get invited to apply fire to their face, purely as a kind of intellectual antidote. \n\nJust imagine someone writing a paper on the topic of total, omnipresent, omnipotent hell. All things which exist, inside or outside of the universe, in all states of time, space, dimension, etc. --**All** things, suffer to the **maximum** extent that the laws of physics allows for, to the maximum degree, and argue that this is not \"objectively\" bad, because if you look at it from the perspective of rocks, who, you know, can't feel pain or have a subjective experience for that matter? ...Well this **clearly** suggests we're merely biased to dislike this idea of **total** omnipresent and omnipotent hell.\n\n&gt;You're also kinda strawmanning what non-utilitarians would think.\n\nI'm also \"strawmanning\"(No, that's not what I'm actually doing, I'm disregarding them because they're confused, but feel free to use words in ways that are convenient for you, even if  they aren't true.) psychopaths and sadists who would think that torturing children is the highest virtue, because it satisfies them personally. What is your point here? Why do your pretend like the truth has to be all-inclusive? \n\nOne can happily inhale their own flatulence on the subject of such sophistry for a lifetime. The antidote to such sophistry is as follows: Apply fire to rock. Note outcome. Apply fire to own face. Note outcome. Extrapolate data on other conscious beings. Correct for forms of \"fire\" across the totality of consciousness. Arrive at tentative conclusion. And the final, and most delicious step of all: Argue with people who pretend things cannot be objectively good or bad, cannot objectively make sense, or that everyone other than themselves are illusions.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1560954860,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"erk44h8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c0oqy7","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_erjn2rr","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/c0oqy7\/we_should_reject_moral_nihilism_even_if_we_are\/erk44h8\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1570279421,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Natural selection creates such wonders as [baboons eating baby gazelles](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=19) as if they were a piece of fruit, [pedophiliac, psychopathic child rapists](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=985) who perform BDSM practices on their stepchildren and [fathers who lock their teenage daughters in a dungeon to rape her daily](https:\/\/youtu.be\/OVmhZsjDT58) for **twenty four** years. This is essentially because, the most highly rewarded trait, in the eyes of evolution by natural selection, is **domination**.\n\nBut that's just what homo sapiens does to other humans. Did you know that the Earth you live in is actually by and large an [animal hell](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3520)? Don't worry if you take the illusion of your life being satisfying or tolerable for granted, because even people who are deeply in touch with the dystopian hellscape that is planet Earth, must dissociate and forget this information on some level in order to not begin 'self-deliverance planning'. \n\n\nBut it actually gets much worse than these seemingly \"edge cases\".\n\nNatural selection in animals, and homo sapiens, creates a hierarchy. Certain phenotypes are more and less beneficial for ascending this hierarchy. The bad news is, the best phenotype for sitting on the throne of humanity, are the following traits when they are exhibited with mastery:\n\n* Domination\n* Manipulation\n* Deception\n* Charm\n* Callous\/Lacking Empathy\n* Self-absorption\n\nYou may be familiar with this description as what is often ascribed to psychopathy. I am not describing a B-grade psychopath like Ted Bundy here, or some Hollywood cartoonish representation of a sadistic, prominent criminal. To understand psychopathy and how it relates to our reality, it can be helpful to make an allegory to a hypothetical online multiplayer game. The first crucial thing to understand is, in this hypothetical game, the **more** successful you are as a player, the more you actually get to **design** the game -- both as a high ranking player, and someone who competes to avoid being de-ranked by another competing player at any cost. The most successful and competitive players essentially write the script to the game's storyline - but this is done covertly, the majority of the playerbase is under the impression that the best players simply help impartial developers here and there with small suggestions that are beneficial for everyone. The best way to succeed in this game however, is to cheat. The rewards for winning in this online game are not simply bragging rights. It's not a \"waste of time\" to play, the reward is in the form of ludicrous wealth, obscene power, and the highest prestige(and envy) to the best players. Perhaps part of this game's culture involved the idea that no one should cheat, because it ruins the game for everyone. Some subset of the games playerbase abides to these rules to various degrees, but there are incentives to cheat in small ways abound. The players are all wired to cheat, which they have to abstain from if it means being exposed, and the system is therefore wired to reward the **best** cheating. Bad cheating-- that is, unsuccessfully deceptive cheating, is punished, often severely. But to truly sit on the throne as the highest ranking player, you've essentially cheated your way to the top somehow(Because skilled player+cheater has an overt advantage against a skilled ethical player, all else equal), and\/or inherited the User Account of a former highly successful player, in many cases. \n\nThis \"cheating is bad\" culture is sometimes very beneficial to the average player. Many people **love** playing this game because of this sense of community, often apparently deeply reciprocal and rule abiding. But what they don't understand is, far above them and around them, there are covert predators who dominate the game. These players benefit from this superficial \"no cheating\" agreement, because it keeps the game running in the case of the master players. These masters are experts at covert cheating, because naturally, a highly skilled player combined with a highly skilled cheater, results in an unstoppable edge, since there's no independent \"developer\" to punish such a player - this player **is** the developer him or herself. From here, it only becomes a chess game involving manipulating the entire playerbase with cheating. You have to not be obvious, which is very tricky. It's hard work to develop a game in a way that is self-serving insofar as it maintains your top 10 ranking position out of many billions of players, while simultaneously not alerting the playerbase to your despotism. Of course, some subset of the playerbase understands the game is completely rigged. Others are suffering from wishful thinking, optimism bias, cognitive dissonance, and various other cognition failures, which is of course, extremely beneficial for the cheater developers. \n\nThere is a tension between leaving this online game, as a person who understands it is rigged, and staying, from multiple perspectives. From the perspective of the player, leaving the game **means** leaving the community. You cannot expose the sinister truth behind the game if you ever leave. However, the game appears so deeply rigged that many do just this. Other's leave the game because they don't even understand it's sinister nature directly, but had their game experience ruined by the bad incentives of it's hidden culture, and fallout from total domination and despotic manipulation.\n\nFrom the perspective of the game developer and high ranking players, it's bad for almost **any** player to leave the game. The status of being such a high ranking player means you essentially own the lower ranking players like cattle, who you leech and parasitize to maintain your position. Your tendrils touch every player, no matter their rank, and the more players, the better, even if they all hate you and wish to expose you as a villain-- they are essentially as powerless as an insect caught in a spider's web. For a low ranking player to leave this hypothetical game, is almost as absurd of a thought as a spider's prey, or a farmer's cow, suddenly gaining sentience and the ability to speak English, and uttering, \"Excuse me, could I uh... Please go now?\" That's just never how those games play out.\n\nThe story gets much worse, alas. Somewhere in the pipeline for this game's development, is an update patch where artificial players can be created to populate the game and serve the highest ranking players in their goals. The lie here is that these new game features will improve the game dramatically for everyone, or transform the game into something wonderful. But almost no one understands that the patch will almost certainly be more of the same self-serving despotism as before. Each player has a new value, each \"farmed player\" now produces a kind \"milk\" as farmed cows do, in the form of programming these future artificial players with every behavior they exhibit in the game, which is tracked and monitored by the top ranking players. The real tragedy is no one copy of this game is truly recognizable from another. Everyone's playing together, but the output on their screens is so different, that they can't even agree on the most important questions related to the game. This is partly due to powerful illusions which are fabricated both by the top players, and those seeking to dethrone them-- which would only be a new set of despots, since there's nothing uniquely evil about the high ranking players, their domination is banal and par for the course when it comes to much of the playerbase. Other illusions are generated simply because some players have a great time, because they were lucky, so they think it's a great game. Sometimes these people get very angry or defensive or ridiculing of those who criticize the game as unfair, malevolent, or sinister. They wish to pretend that the game they're playing is fair-- that yes, some people are highly successful, and yes, there are perks that come with this where you can have a say in how the game's storyline plays out to some minor degree, but the game is *certainly* not corrupt or nightmarish in some dystopian sense. In this game's culture, the very idea of a conspiracy by the top players is met with ridicule, and the enforcers of this aspect of the games culture are these players who deeply want to believe they, and everyone, plays an ultimately fair game, or perhaps a game that is unfair today, but a game where **everyone** must work to make more fair. Cynicism, pessimism, and talk of conspiracy is anathema to these individuals-- it means an attempt to expose what's behind the curtain, and this **ruins the fun**. It messes with sunk costs. Some of these players of course are having a miserable time, but convince themselves to get out of bed daily and that it's not so bad because a bone gets thrown their way every so often. A larger subset still are miserable and know it, they **really** know the grim prognosis... but are hopeful for a brighter version of the game to be released some day where genuine truth, justice, or beauty will shine on this rotten game.\n\n\n...and it almost certainly will be released. Which is not cause for celebration, but another sinister element of the game, since these versions serve to placate the low ranking players. \n\nLike a torture victim, given their first glass of water to drink in days.\n\n\nSuddenly, things are looking hopeful.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1561007850,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"erm6ewe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c2o4ft","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_c2o4ft","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/c2o4ft\/it_is_no_measure_of_health_to_be_well_adjusted_to\/erm6ewe\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1570327581,"score":-2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

These methods are probably the answer you're looking for as to \"handling\" the tragedy and malevolence of life, but nonetheless I'll offer my own perspective despite more or less being certain it isn't what you're looking for, if for no other reason than to add some color to the spectrum of responses.\n\nThe color I'll be adding is black, and the worldview is some of the deepest pessimism and cynicism you'll encounter.\n\nNatural selection and the constant mutation of DNA promote [domination robots](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=985) to compete in a kind of [meat grinder](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=19). Rules are inherent in social systems, so only the domination robots which can [bypass the rules] successfully get to win the game. This is done by the unconscious development of a phenotype which excels at winning by overtly breaking rules because they cannot be challenged, or by skillful, covert rule-breaking. Manifestation of this phenotype is what can be described as psychopathy, and is present to some degree in all apes, who are selfish, manipulative, domineering, callous, deceptive, and charming. The average ape is socialized to avoid these drives to some degree, albeit some prominent gendered differences occur during socialization, such as domineering in men and manipulation in women, but these traits are of course not exclusive to genders: All apes are psychopaths to some degree, because that is the natural outcome of DNA. Cognitive bias like self-deception and compartmentalization allows for the masking of these traits and forming a sense of self that is usually believable to be good in some sense. The same biases color our representation of the hellscape of reality as, at worst, \"Tough, but worth living.\" and at best \"A miraculous, wonderful privilege.\" The combination of these traits allows for a superficial representation of benevolence on the individual, cultural\/ideological\/state, and global level, while obfuscating the sinister nature of DNA, Natural selection and the Psychopathic hierarchy which has historically and presently sought and succeeded to dominate [humans](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mFW3NVJe-78) and [animals](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3520) alike on Earth today.(I recommend muting the sound in the first video, as it absurdifies and therefore derealizes the real horror being displayed.)\n\nFundamentally nothing has changed about humanity in our history of torturing and brutalizing each other. The winners of this race reproduced. The losers were tortured and killed. The winners not only rewrite history and [fabricate the present](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/Evni0PV.png) but write the future, unless challenged by new winners. These new winners will simply be *better* psychopaths, because the only thing which successfully defeats a highly skilled player and highly skilled cheater in a game that rewards these two traits, are better versions of said phenotypes. Lionel Messi may be an excellent soccer player, but a version of him which is just as skilled, far less ethical, far better at convincing others to forgive in-game transgressions by feigning ignorance or accident or shifting blame or simply not being noticed, will be a superior player in a game which cannot perfectly punish rule-breaking. The same concept is true for those who 1) Rule the world and 2) Dominate human beings in small-scale social encounters.\n\nThere's not much solace to be found in this view of the world since the prognosis can't get more grim, and it is certainly not for everyone(nor can it be, if the world agreed on this fact the only rational move would be mass suicide or similar). To genuinely believe it would psychologically destabilize most people in the same way that the worst psychedelic experience risks doing so. Does it help to \"handle\" tragedy? I think it does, in a way, because nothing is more empowering than understanding the truth. It sets you free. It not only explains evil as unconscious, and like a destructive tornado, it helps you come to terms with your own flaws, as merely an ape running on hundreds of millions of years of deeply selfish and perverse fine tuning. The problem with coming to terms with this and other things in the 'hard to swallow' category, is to first notice that we never use the phrase \"The sweet truth\". The truth is usually attributed a bitter character.  This is a kind of 'clue' to think about when approaching the puzzle of life on Earth. And unfortunately, I think a truly honest, sensitive commitment to discovering the precise character of this truth results in such intense bitterness that it would be rejected outright by almost everyone. This is the quintessence of having your coffee with no sugar, and some like it that way. I hope you overcome your tragedy one way or another. If anything, hopefully the magnitude of the farce of suffering on the planet can trick your mind here for an outcome that is psychologically positive somehow.

That which is adaptive, survives and wins. That which is maladaptive, dies and loses.\n\nThe second is changing ones perspective, away from the individual, and instead from a State-eye view of the world. Pretend you're an all powerful, totalitarian despot.\n\nYou're the leader of a tribe or a kingdom. What do you want your peasants to believe? What should they be allowed to do or not do? First of all, there are **other** tribes and kingdoms you're competing with. They probably want to exploit or even kill you, to take your things. Or maybe ally with you if doing the former is not beneficial to their strategy, but it wouldn't be to ally with you because they're 'nice guys who love doing the right thing', it would be because allying with you would *help* them exploit or kill *other* tribes.\n\nSo... we'll need an army, at minimum, right? We need soldiers. We need farmers. People to do labor. We need technological advancement, because that helps us defend ourselves at minimum, but also helps us conquer other things. \n\nMaybe we're getting ahead of ourselves at this point and you're thinking...\n\n\"Wait wait wait. I don't want to kill anyone! I don't even *want* an army.\"\n\nWell... then you're just dead. Because the *other* tribes and kingdoms are doing exactly that. So the tribes and kingdoms that want to play some peaceful, enlightened, benevolent game? Those tribes go bye bye. Dead to natural selection. So it's *only* people who are progressively *better* and *better* at playing the war and conquest game. Perhaps their strategy is hyper defensive, but they're still *playing* in a highly competitive manner.\n\nBack to the strategy. Let's start easy: Child free. What if people in your kingdom notice, \"Hmm.. life sure is hard. Lot of hard work. Lot of abuse. Little reward. This is *not* a good deal. If we refuse work we just tortured, so we're forced to do this for a warring kingdom. I think we should stop having kids.\" And this becomes a movement. What is your response?\n\n\"Oh okay, great. I guess we'll just *die*.\"\n\nNo, of course not. You will kill these people, and aggressively advocate natalism. Your entire strategy will be to populate your kingdom, because it means more workers, soldiers, developers of technology, etc. What if some people in your kingdom want to waste their sexual energy in ways that doesn't produce offspring? What if they want to masturbate, have anal sex, or have sex with the same gender? Well those things quickly *need* to become taboos with harsh punishments(death penalty for \"sodomy\") and disincentives(circumcision). \n\nWhat if your people go, \"Look.. this place is **insane**. I'm defecting.\" Well then, perhaps you can construe that as treason. But if you make a law that says \"You can't leave our country for another country!\" that looks *really* bad on you. So we can't expose our own dystopia this way. We'll just sweep this problem under the rug.\n\nWhat if people say, \"I know I can't leave... so I don't even want to. No where I can go will work, everywhere is hell, because everywhere people are competing in the same psychopathic way. **I want to die.**\"\n\nWell then, here we need to put our foot down. If we let people die because we live in a hellish world, then we'll lose the race! The country who has a combination of 1) citizenry who is clued in to the rigged game, while 2) has the dirtiest policies, treating their people like chattel, is the place most at risk for suicide. This place would need to create a taboo on death. Maybe they'll invent a lie that says \"You go to hell and are tortured for *infinity* if you kill yourself. This myth is also used for the aforementioned taboos, of homosexuality, sodomy, etc. It's an effective propaganda tool in times of low education.\n\nYou should be getting the point now. One final thing to clarify here is there is no \"King\" necessarily ordering these things-- this can all arise from the products of evolution by natural selection. That which is most beneficial, 'sticks'. People make up crazy ideas all the time, which don't stand the test of time, because they don't serve the Kingdom to be the most dominant Kingdom in history. So there isn't necessarily a grand conspiracy here by the \"King\", even thought that is certainly a reality to some unknown extent.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1561080771,"distinguished":null,"edited":1561081248,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"erojnmq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c2vlrd","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_c2vlrd","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/c2vlrd\/why_exactly_are_things_like_misanthropy\/erojnmq\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1570412635,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I'll be exposing my ignorance about evolutionary biology when I make any speculation like that, and speciation is probably the wrong word here, but I'm really just trying to point out the incredible forking of humanity that has been taking place for thousands of years and will grow more and more dramatic. It's without question that the elite of the elite of homo sapiens in 2019 have access to different technologies, medical advancement, etc, than an average member of the species. To me, the fact that there are such broad category differences within a species feel so... wrong to describe everything in that species as simply belonging to the same genome. It's right technically, but it misses the point, that the lower hierarchy of the genome is being enslaved in a sense. Look at angler fish reproduction:\n\nhttps:\/\/mentalfloss.com\/article\/57800\/horrors-anglerfish-mating\n\nSure, they're all involved in the task of \"making more anglerfish\", just like an ant queen and worker drone is involved in the task of \"making more ants\", but the category difference feels so immense. It almost misses the point to categorize by species here. It's tough to illustrate exactly what I mean, since again, I just don't understand the biology well enough, but maybe you can tease out a point somewhere there. Another way to frame it is the category of species becomes more and more brittle when you create a big enough difference between members of the species. A thought experiment here is just to take this to the most absurd conclusion: Imagine a species of higher animal that had two genders, male and female. The females were expressed as you normally see on Earth(Imagine any fish, mammal, bird), but then the males were simply amoeba like organisms which carried sperm, and lived on the female's reproductive organs. When eggs were ready, they mated, and out came more females and males. It almost feels silly to call this a species. It's technically correct, but the difference within the species is so vast, it misses the point to focus on the species.\n\nThe same scenario would be meaningful if you *didn't* separate the genders, but instead created some other massive disparity. You could have a species of ape who, enslaves it's own species, and then plays their own society like chess pieces in combat with other societies of chess playing apes. Males and females on the bottom are essentially chattel for the ape kings and queens. You could continue to edit and morph such a species in such a way as to make it so there's not enough DNA disparity to prevent mating from any members of the species, but the way the phenotypes or even genotypes manifest themselves would be so dramatically different, you could hardly tell they were the same species or even from the same planet in principle(if you changed their appearance dramatically without changing their DNA), if you didn't look at the DNA. It's scientifically taboo to ascribe this much meaning to scientific observations, but I suppose it's more of a philosophical observation than a scientific one. We don't look at species of Bees and say, \"The queen is a despot and has enslaved her workers.\" We just say, \"That's a species of bees.\" But it's true that certain members of a species get a raw deal in the same sense that parasitized animals get a raw deal from their interactions with parasites.

In a true hell where something like the Holocaust can occur, or a hypothetical scenario where an evil elite dominate and enslave their ideological enemies, it may be extremely justified, even an emergency to commit suicide.\n\nEvery moment one spends being a beacon for the idea, \"We are indeed in hell\" is a moment where an association is made between you and an ally of yours, which only strengthens the network of victims for persecution. Even if no persecution occurs, simple categorization occurs. Every time someone upvotes the post of someone who explains they are in hell, is another association made in a network of those who would harbor ideas that this is hell. The figurative kings and queens of hell benefit from this action, even unconsciously. You could be a kind of \"fly trap\" for future victims, if the hell you're in is the inescapable kind that can never improve. There's no way to easily answer the question because it's so difficult to know if such a hell is escapable or not, or if \"the game\" is winnable or not. Sometimes it can feel like there is no winning move to make.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1561109371,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"erpbc51","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c32wdr","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_erpazub","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/c32wdr\/surviving_suicidal_depression\/erpbc51\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1570445748,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Psychology is certainly an interesting variable that can color our experience, but I think the advantage here lies with the pessimist, not the optimist. It is arguably more powerful of an argument to tell someone \"Your optimism is coloring your philosophy in a way that leads you to be confused\" , rather than \"Your pessimism...\"\n\nBut first, a small tangent:\n\n&gt;This desire on Sam's part to undermine someone's philosophy as a psychological defect, is also breathtakingly hypocritical. Sam has spoken out countless times on his podcast about those critics who resort to ascribing psychological motives to his own views. Naturally, he absolutely hates it when his opponents wave away his criticism of Islam on the grounds that it stems from feelings of deep-seated racism. So Sam's dismissal of Benetar and nihilism here is pure double-standards.\n\nI think this is a harmful non-sequitur. There's no reason to believe he is a racist, and to suggest that racism colors his criticisms of a suicidal religious ideology, is far more absurd than suggesting someone's pessimist philosophy is colored by depression. Actually listening to him speak about Muslims distinguished as people and not adherents to a dangerous ideology, reveals this very quickly. Accusations of racism are largely the result of a smear campaign against him.\n\n\nWith regards to Antinatalism, I think the misunderstanding really hinges on the nature of reality. If reality is on the whole negative, then there's some character to optimism that necessarily causes one to be less in touch with it. Optimism seems to be skewed to distort reality(Notice we say things like 'rose-colored glasses', not 'black-tinted glasses'), even if that false reality leads to [adaptations for survival](https:\/\/www.salon.com\/2012\/06\/12\/the_evolutionary_origins_of_optimism\/), where as pessimism seems less so.(Notice we say, 'the bitter truth', there is no equivalent expression of something both deeply positive and true). With pessimism we should expect to find the opposite effect. Depression should be mostly maladaptive(slinking into a cave and languishing in misery may be a desperation move, however). There's the idea that [that depressed individuals make more realistic inferences than non-depressed individuals](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Depressive_realism). These are all interesting clues towards the nature of reality.\n\nAgain, what should we expect to be true in psychological terms **if** reality is on the whole negative, vs. on the whole positive? We don't care about someone's unique perspective on life, because we *know* there's a huge range of personal satisfaction in life. Some people will report that things are going great, others terrible. These perspectives alone tell us nothing. We need to know the practical nature of reality to understand the psychological impact of optimism and pessimism.\n\nI think the core argument is valid, that psychology can color one's outlook on life. But there's nothing preventing Sam Harris from being the sufferer of psychology here, which I don't think he takes ample space to admit or worry about. I think David was too polite here. I absolutely don't blame him for it one bit, because there is much pressure in presenting a philosophy you think is simultaneously hard to swallow and deeply morally pressing. But he probably should have pushed Sam in the same way, and said something like:\n\n\"You have a wife and two girls, and you have this immense cost sunk into your work. Could this possibly prevent you from seeing reality as it is?\"","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1561173061,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"errk5ou","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c3bfid","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_c3bfid","permalink":"\/r\/samharris\/comments\/c3bfid\/on_sam_harris_ad_hominem_attack_on_antinatalism\/errk5ou\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1570551469,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"samharris","subreddit_id":"t5_2thqg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/samharris","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

It's not a fixed nature. People are only as good as the structures that they exist in allow them to be.\n\nThat is totally at odds with the current scientific understanding of human nature. I don't think the idea that humanity has some potential can be disputed except by the most cynical interpretations, so I agree with you there, but it's absolutely true that genes determine who we are. Certain phenotypes get selected, it's just how evolution works. Guess which phenotype is the best for ascending human hierarchy? Is it the phenotype of the Dalai lama, or the phenotype of some psychopathic oil tycoon politician? We're far closer to latter than the former in our human nature. It's inside of us all. You're selfish. Egomaniacal. Aggressive. Domineering. Manipulative. You lack empathy for others, but you also have the skill of brutally lying to yourself about this lack of empathy, and other things. Why would evolution give you such a counter-intuitive ability? Because it helps you brutally lie to others, in believing your **own** lies. This is the \"magic trick\" of natural selection. This is inherent to all apes. People like Marx(Left) or Hitler(Right) deny this. They think they should change humanity, or that some part of humanity is good while another part is bad. This is delusional, self-serving ideological nonsense and completely at odds with science.\n\nYou're the descendant of apes who bashed the brains in of another ape while they slept, fucked the ape's girlfriend, and skip ahead a few hundred thousand years, and here you and I type at each other. The good and kind ape who wasn't willing to do this? Dead. Eaten. Cannibalized. \n\nNature is brutal. Evolution is brutal. DNA is brutal. Marx is confused about human nature. A commune of a million people results in hierarchical domination just as reliably as a capitalistic society of a million people does, because the system has nothing to do with the end result, DNA does. And the DNA is busted because that's what **worked** for survival. Get it? What works: Green light. What doesn't work? Bye bye time. That's the reality of evolution. And it turns out being truly and wholeheartedly nice and cooperative meant you became someone's slave or were killed. A society of pure psychopaths will always defeat a non psychopathic society in evolutionary terms, because psychopathy is the ultimate phenotypical model for \"winning the game\", because it gets to pretend it's good, while actually being bad. It gets the best of both worlds. It gets to cheat to the maximum extent without getting caught - that is an advantage. And when there's an advantage, you know the drill. Green light. And this is the world we live in. This is who you are. This is who I am. The moment you plug this notion into reality with total honesty, and examine the results, the moment you'll see that it is the truth. There's hope in our ability to become self aware and notice how utterly deranged and selfish we are, and how we constantly feel the need to dominate other human beings, but the system is just **buggy**. It's **hard** to do. And by lying to ourselves, we doom ourselves to ever recover from the brutality of nature.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1561196598,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ers2qu0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c30dw0","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_errunot","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/c30dw0\/relevant\/ers2qu0\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1570586228,"score":4,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I think discussing the video alone will demonstrate my position and address every single objection you've brought up. \n\nThe very first thing to acknowledge is, **I am not claiming that small groups of humanity cannot improve tremendously.** Hierarchy is far harder to escape, but **improvement** is all over, and it's night and day. This is obvious throughout human history, where there have been relatively peaceful cultures, and violent and cruel cultures. \n\nThat being said, don't interpret the video with rose colored glasses. Aggression for baboons must have dropped significantly, but it certainly hasn't vanished. Millions of years of incentives and drives created by natural selection **don't magically vanish** when you kill the alpha males. They **decrease**. The society is **still** hierarchical, it **still** sucks to be the lowest ranking member of even the best baboon tribe. \n\nNow for the core claim I'm making: **The Big Picture**.\n\nNotice how we're only speaking about small tribes? That is totally uncontroversial. But the game fundamentally changes when you frame things in the context of **many** tribes. When one stereotypical baboon tribe descends on those who were accidentally culled due to some disease, what happens? That's right, natural selection. Free food, fun(in the form of sadism), and mating for the aggressive, domineering tribe. This is how the game works. Accidents can sometimes reverse the course of natural selection, which is to promote the **strongest** strategy. I would never argue against this. But ultimately, the game rewards cheating and strength. If you're the **strongest** **cheater**, you are unstoppable, except for when a stronger, more skilled cheater shows up to the scene. If a freak accident dethrones you? Lucky break for everyone else, but ultimately, natural selection will continue selecting, and will eventually catch up. This is the meat grinder you live in. It's inescapable. Ideologies which dismiss the nature of this are a fantasy, and for good reason, we evolved to cope in ways that guarantee we're delusional apes. As long as we lie to ourselves and others about our nature, we are completely and utterly doomed to attempt to create solutions that are not actual solutions, as history will attest to.\n\nThe road to hell is paved by good intentions.\n\nEdit: Small typo.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1561255324,"distinguished":null,"edited":1562185571,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ertweil","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c30dw0","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ertnjmb","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/c30dw0\/relevant\/ertweil\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1570709081,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

We can test the hypothesis of \"Civilization is the problem\" with a thought experiment.\n\nSimply imagine the *best* civilization you can. If you can imagine a civilization that has no logical inconsistency, which works in practice(Think big! It helps to **not** envision human beings but an alien race), then we **know** civilization must not **instrinsically** be the problem. It **must** be something else. If not civilization, then what? What about capitalism? It sure *seems* evil, and the idea is highly fashionable today. But again, thought experiment. Can we imagine a *capitalist* civilization(Again, don't think human - think of the **best** alien race your imagination can come up with) which isn't anywhere near the psychopathic game that typifies our socioeconomy? \n\nIf we can imagine this, we **know** capitalism can't be the problem. So what is? Is it the universe itself? Is it the laws of physics? The second law of thermodynamics? Well... no, these things seem benign too in principle. But then why is humanity so reliably awful? What **makes** humanity behave in awful ways? We know it **can't** be only humanity, because if we look at some cousins of ours in the animal Kingdom, they're pretty awful too. \n\nIs it... apes? Are apes evil? Well, no... look at great white sharks. Look at [lions](https:\/\/youtu.be\/1x9zbO1-0Uc?t=234). They're clearly awful to themselves and those around them. So maybe... It's predators? [Parasites](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-ySwuQhruBo) aren't technically predators, and they cause immense misery. \n\nSo what the hell is it?\n\nIt appears to boil down to the natural outcomes of a **game**. The game says, you have this firmware called DNA, a kind of 'script' for the 'character'. The firmware jumbles itself randomly, mutating-- this changes the character. And then the output of the firmware changes, sometimes in minor ways, sometimes in dramatic ways.  When the change is beneficial to survival(Notice, not good. Not ethical. Not moral. Not kind.) it gets to go forward. When the change is bad for survival, it goes away. **Even** if it's good, ethical, moral, kind. Because the game **doesn't care** about these things. If it seems to, it does so by **accident**. This is what those who make the argument from altruism fail to appreciate.\n\nDNA and Natural selection make it so the strongest agent, and the most skilled cheater, **win**. The system this creates, is one where the winners can shape a reality with rules, because rules give **them** an advantage. Rules are **broken** by skilled cheaters, but they're a kind of 'shackle' for someone who is unskilled\/not a rulebreaker(ethical). They weigh these agents down, like a ball and chain. When you introduce billions of years of selection into the mix, the game creates \"things\". It creates strategies for dominating everything and perfectly breaking rules(psychopathy). It creates systems like money, which are a fun little game which of course are subject to the **ultimate** rules of the \"big game\", which is evolution by natural selection. The best, most cunning cheater with the strongest drive, wins. And by winning, they enslave the rest, because that's an accidental byproduct of the *strategy* for winning(being a psychopath).","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1561261735,"distinguished":null,"edited":1561262185,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eru3e36","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c3uu96","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_c3uu96","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/c3uu96\/ranttechnologyfreedomand_this_world\/eru3e36\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1570722155,"score":15,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Values are a superficial, story telling layer mapped over an ancient lizard-ape firmware.  Beliefs and values certainly matter, but the drives behind them are immense.

You fail to appreciate the **difference** between the process of dying with all of it's problematic entanglements( again, a forgivable ignorance on your part because you've clearly not spent a lot of time standing on the precipice of bridges or endured the psychological states that get you to such locations. And even if you have, there's no guarantee the outcome was being deeply in touch with the reality of such experiences due to post hoc rationalizations.), and the **state** of non-existence. There's another somewhat philosophical objection in the distinction between never having come into existence, and necessarily going **back** to non-existence post death. Even in the most insane religious interpretations of the world, people once *didn't* exist, then god made them into souls, and sent them into zygotes, and so on. But from here, they are burdened with experience *beyond earth*. The idea of an afterlife appears to inherently be more 'stubborn' that the idea of a 'forelife', but that is a minor point.\n\n&gt;You assert being a sociopath is a bad thing. \n\nNo, not exactly. This is a perspectival question, because from the point of view of natural selection, sociopathic behavior(specifically psychopathy which is just sociopathy with extra tricks to not look like a crude thug at all times), is the most powerful social adaptation.\n\n&gt;One can't have a society where everyone is dead. The excuse that \"it's really hard to kill everyone.\" is irrelevant. \n\nYou seem to be very stuck on confusing death, versus never coming into existence. This is an important distinction I'll be reminding you of. No one said \"it's hard to kill everyone\", I was arguing that there is a clear ethical dilemma in doing so. \n\n&gt;You state this as if not walking into the casino is an option. We are born in the casino, everything a chance. \n\nYou never walk into the casino. You pull someone out of the void and throw them into it. There are consequences for doing this.

If you kill yourself, you're a coward(Hilarious, because suicide is **extremely** difficult to do and requires extreme courage).

I don't think anyone whose behavior has been strongly moved to suicide ever thinks it's easy, if you have, again, you have not spent time sitting on the edge of a bridge. Ideation is very common, everyone alive has considered suicide at one point. Your life has not been a farce of misery and pain and ostracism to the point of the only thing stopping you from ending your life is access to a reliable method and the requisite chemistry to carry out such a method. Think of it like a dial. The dial says \"misery threshold\". When the dials hits a certain mark, you die. How quickly the dial is turned matters, so the threshold changes contextually. My assumption about you, and again, feel free to correct me, is that your dial has not been terribly close to the threshold, because the esoteric knowledge that tends to come from this experience, is that suicide is in no way easy. People who are actually ready to die appreciate this, and people who have never been there, do not. Even terminally ill patients who know death is near, who suffer in immense pain, struggle to die.

Imagine the casino has a hospital ward. We live in the casino. If we want out, there is only one way.\n\nAgain, the choice is made for us.

This is a product of thinking capitalism, rather than apes, are the problem. What you seem to not appreciate is, the world is currently organized in a nice little pyramid. You know, the kind that's on your money? The kind with the little eye on the tippy top?\n\nThe most skillful, manipulative, dominating, callous, deceptive, charming apes on the planet, sit in that little eye today. Some combination of these traits are what is demanded to become say, the CEO of a top 10 conglomerate worldwide, or the head of an intelligence agency, or the general of a superpower's army, or some other figure with immense executive power on planet Earth. In this way, psychopathy is a kind of superpower.\n\nThis is true in Capitalism, Socialism, Anarcho Syndicalism, and any socio\/economic system, because the common denominator here is the species of ape, Homo sapiens, who had it's DNA aggressively and violently selected to produce the trickiest, most dominating specimens. These specimens by definition rise to the top with the same law of physics, that cream rises to the top in a bucket of milk. The milk below is of course, always full fat, and never skim. In the same sense, we descend from the best psychopaths who murdered the lesser psychopaths and any benevolent apes that were around. The women were raped, and the rest were killed and eaten. This process took over a million years. So current living specimens are a distillate of that phenotype, and the current apes sitting on the thrones today, are a **superhuman** distillate of that. Again, the socioeconomic system changing won't change this. You are a farm animal under Anarcho Syndicalism too, because of this.\n\nNow, if you understand this, imagine what sort of apes it requires to successfully uproot Capitalism? You seem to have this naiive vision of \"Bad, capitalist guys, and Good, socialist(or whatever flavor of anti-Capitalism you subscribe to) revolutionaries\"\n\nThis is a fantasy, because all apes are incentivized to be evil, manipulative, psychopaths and psychotics. If capitalism is ever overthrown, it will only be done so by *bigger* psychopaths. The true perverse irony for you here, is you don't actually want what is to come in a post-capitalist world.

It selects for selfish genes. The gene is that which must continue surviving to the next generation. \n\nYes well, it may only seem like we disagree, but we're really just talking about the same thing. What I'm saying is that the most selfish genes express themselves in the phenotype of psychopathy. You can be as selfish as you want, but if someone has risen to the height of human hierarchy in such as way as to chain everyone inside a small metal box and keep them alive in a dystopia, no amount of genetic selfishness saves you. You are permanently doomed in a kind of prison of someone else's [genetic dominance](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3465). This is an expression of the phenotype winning. If you want to call that \"The Selfish Gene\" that's perfectly compatible.\n\n&gt;In populations with similar genes, especially when competing against other life forms, individual selfishness (trickiness, domination, what have you) is not always the optimal behavior. Cooperation or altruism is very often a better choice in those populations. An individual bee will gladly die by suicide to protect the hive. Why? Because even though the DNA lives in that bee, thousands of copies of its genes are replicated in the surviving members of the colony. The bee may die but the genes continue living.\n\nConsider the cow scenario above. In small scale settings, altruism could be a powerful adaptation that has non-zero sum outcomes for the cow. But this is always doomed to be co-opted by the previous style of \"The Dominant Gene\", provided such strategies exist. No amount of altruism saves you in the cow hell scenario. You're chained to a stall. Your non-zero sum, accidental phenotypes, are now your downfall in evolutionary history, because you didn't 1) Evolve tool use 2) Evolve complex neuroanatomy 3) Evolve an extremely callous, manipulative, deceptive, dominating, and socially charming phenotype. You lose.\n\nThe exact same scenario is true for human populations. And this is completely compatible with altruism. The bee sacrificing themselves for genetic fitness is good from the perspective of evolution, but so is cow hell. From the eyes of evolution, cows are doing great. Those genes, that got them enslaved and tortured? Those genes are rockin' it. Sure, they don't actually understand that a conscious force has enslaved them, and selects them at will, and stewards(My attempt to take the gold in euphemism) them into the future.\n\nThis sort of genetic fitness is not meaningful. You don't want to be the bee who sacrifices themselves. You don't want to be cow that is enslaved. You don't want to be the human who is enslaved. Altruism and cooperation are not as good as they sound. They are accidental tricks that get exploited, rather tricks that redeem us. \n\n&gt;Also, you seem to conflate \"rising to the top\" of the social hierarchy with survival, in the evolutionary sense. Is it clear that those who dominate the hierarchy, through \"psychopathy\" or whatever, see a benefit in terms of gene production? I don't see an American billionaire \"surviving\" better than the third-world workers he exploits, in the evolutionary sense. So even discarding altruism as a survival strategy, \"rising to the top\" is not necessarily a winning evolutionary strategy.\n\nAgain, this is a very fine grained way to see 'survival', that I'd argue isn't meaningful. The farmers running the worst torture chamber for cows on earth aren't surviving any better than the cows they breed, in the evolutionary sense. Whatever differences exist here, again in the evolutionary sense, are irrelevant, because the genes at the end of the day, say the same things: \"Don't care, I made it another day.\"\n\nThe difference in non-evolutionary terms is plain as day. The farmer controls the genetic destiny of the cow. The farmer can end the species if he wants, or create rockets and technology and terraform the planet Mars and literally just fill it with 10 trillion miserable, moaning, suffering cows. There's nothing in the laws of physics that prevents this. Whatever genes are operative in these 10 trillion cows, well, guess what, they're just thrilled in some genetic sense. But this isn't meaningful from a consciousness perspective.

And only if pressing that button had a guaranteed failsafe that would prevent life from re-emerging.\n\nThis part is almost perfectly articulated as far as I can see, with one small problem to consider: The possible responsibility towards sentience elsewhere in the universe. If there are galaxies of hell out there which 1) express similar or even higher sentience than on earth and 2) express equivalent or more meaningful versions of hell, we may be uniquely privileged in reaching a stage of evolution where we can actually reach a \"red button scenario\".

After all life is erased, the nanobots would keep self-replicating with the goal of preventing the re-occurrence of life. \n\nThe problem with nanobots is they are functionally the same as organic life with DNA, and potentially suffer from evolution. So long as an error in the code is possible according to the laws of physics(even if error is not inherent to the bot, as it is to the organism with DNA), evolution can occur and sentience can occur, given enough time.

It happens to be the status quo that granting death is okay if one grants life, but this does not follow. Granting suffering is also not okay if one grants life. For this to be coherent, life would need to be either intrinsically good or free from suffering, or suffering would need to be eclipsed by wellbeing, or the risk of suffering would need to not be meaningful. If none of these are the case, granting life is indefensible. Therefore, if it is not okay to give someone death by giving them life, then the conclusion of the main argument does not follow on ethical grounds.\n\n&gt;You don't know if the persons wishes were to be resucitated or not. You perform CPR on the person, and he is now alive again. You gave him life.

A, B and C.\n\nTribes ABC are competing for resources and power. Each has an alliance with the other(rock, paper, scissors) so no one tribe wins. Nonetheless, wars occur, and competition is constant, both from the elders to indoctrinate the basic tribes people, and from the elders to confuse the tribes people of the enemy tribe.\n\nEach tribe wants to maximize their own population, to win the \"race\". More population means greater GDP, in general. It means more potential soldiers, more tax payers, and more probability of an \"Einstein\" to develop nuclear weapons for your tribe first. These are all advantages to be strategically maximized like you are playing a simulation game, except here, natural selection and some meddling from the Elders is the person sitting behind the mouse and keyboard. Each tribe has an incentive to invent stories, which will increase their own population. If they can invent a story which will lower the population of the other tribes, this is good for that tribe. Times are hard in Tribes ABC. The tribes people live hard lives, and they question existence. The forced competition and constant \"racing\" creates suffering, because each Elder is forced to put their tribes people through hell, because if they slow down, the other 2 tribes will destroy them. So everyone is forced to compete, or be destroyed. No tribe wants to minimize population, unless it means minimizing the *other* tribes population.\n\nWhat are some other ways to worry about population? Suicide is one.  If each tribe can spread a myth that suicide is bad, they have an advantage. If one tribe can successfully spread stories to the other tribe that makes suicide okay, that is good. Each tribe is constantly trying to 1) Create 0% suicide in their tribe. 2) Maximize suicide in other tribes. This makes them \"win\" the race. Drugs are often used for suicide, so it would benefit Tribe A to make suicide drugs illegal by harsh penalty, while simultaneously controlling the drug production, and flooding tribes B and C with these drugs. \"He who controls the spice, controls the galaxy.\"\n\nThe taboo of homosexuality. Homosexuality results in a weakened military for the \"race\", because a mixture of homosexual testosterone robot warriors, and heterosexual testosterone robot warriors, is less advantageous than 100% heterosexual testosterone warriors. This is due to the nature of testosterone in triggering violent behavior for selective reasons(the most adaptive, fit, warrior ape reaps the most sexual benefits. If these benefits are squandered in non-procreative homosexual engagement, this is a disadvantage in evolutionary terms). Each tribe wants to: 1) Create 0% homosexuality in their own tribe. 2) Create maximized homosexuality in enemy tribe. Female homosexuality is somewhat relevant, but not nearly as much for the reasons why male homosexuality is relevant. This explains the disparity between the taboo in our own world, and why gay men are harshly punished historically, but little is mentioned of lesbian women. Regardless, each tribe must invent myths or harsh punishments for homosexuality for 1) maximum population growth 2) maximum military strength, or they risk \"losing the race\". \n\nThe taboo of euthanasia. Each tribe wants to force their old tribespeople to live as long as possible, even if it means suffering. The tribe which creates the most forced suffering, maximizes population and maximizes economic growth, because each living person is profitable in some way. The tribe which allows death early, is at a disadvantage economically. Each tribe wants to 1) Minimize premature death in their own tribe. 2) Maximize premature death in the enemy tribes.\n\nThe taboo of abortion. This one is pretty obvious. If you're killing potential tribespeople, you are at a disadvantage. You want to minimize enemy populations, and maximize your own population. Myths about the sanctity of life will benefit you if your population believes them, and as we know with evolutionary concepts, that which is beneficial is selected, regardless if it is true or not.\n\nThe Taboo of conservatism and cultural change. Religion, culture, and any change to the \"order\" of each tribe, is very much like a kind of death. If Tribes A has 100% subscription to Religion X, and Tribe B has a 100% subscription to Religion Y, and Tribe B, either through the meddling of Tribe A, or by accident, causes them to drop to 50% subscription to Religion Y, Tribe A has the advantage because they have ideological unity. This is true for politics, culture, any \"change\" or breaking of status quo. Diversity and progress has it's own utility, but too much of it is easily exploited because it causes a upheaval and overthrow of the old \"strategy\". This is the phrase, \"If it isn't broken, don't fix it.\" But if it is broken, you should \"hammer the nail sticking out in place\". The tribe which tries to fix things which aren't broken, is at risk of ruining things. Old way = good, new way = bad. This is an evolutionary strategy which succeeds, because there are many more ways to fail than there are to succeed. Each tribe is incentivized to 1) Avoid risk for their own tribe 2) Promote risk for the enemy tribes, and capitalize on the chaos.\n\n**All** of the above is an expression of simple strategy of how to \"win the race\", as a single, unified strategy, mostly revolving around a resistance to change and a maximizing of population(population= profits\/soldiers\/Einsteins). This is what is in common with the pattern you are seeing with your parents. The key to understand these things is not to think about what makes sense for an individual. If we think this way, then of *course* preventing two men from marrying or stopping a 82 year old in pain from peacefully dying is absurd. The reason why two men can't marry or why there is resistance to abortion in much of the world has *nothing* to do with logic or reason or ethics, it has to do with **game theory** and **evolution** in the **big picture**.\n\nEdit: To clarify, what I wrote may seem like some top-down conspiracy, but not much of it needs to be conscious or intentional. All of what I'm describing could occur as a result of natural processes and bad incentives. This is the power of natural selection, it creates the illusion of intention and engineering. To be clear, I'm **not** painting a world where evil kings conspire to ruin their own citizenry and others(although that must happen to *some* degree).","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1561566048,"distinguished":null,"edited":1561629430,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"es3mp8i","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c5qzgc","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_c5qzgc","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/c5qzgc\/is_it_just_me_or_people_who_are_against_the\/es3mp8i\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1570959629,"score":18,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I haven't watched the Vulnerable world link, but I just finished the woman's culpability video and have some thoughts in response which I'll write here.\n\nI don't think that placing the blame on one gender over another is useful or accurate. To preface this criticism, I want to say that I don't subscribe to some modern ideology that is trigger happy to blame any criticism of women on misogyny. I'm not especially sympathetic to women or men, and I believe each gender has it's own ethical issues. If there are genuine reasons to criticize women but not men(or vice versa) for something related to ethics, I am not closed to do so.\n\nHowever, whatever traits are self-evident to women that they are \"baby making machines\", there must be traits which prevent women from going against this first set of traits.

Many animals will kill themselves when trapped. The lower you are, the more likely you will recognize how bad the game is. This is a perspectival problem. It just so happens we're the sort of animal who can do that *and* also ponder what is right and wrong with ideas like reality, life, social systems, animals. When you mix these concepts you can find yourself in a position that can hold the proposition: \"There is something deeply wrong with existence-- so wrong, that it would be far better off if it all just evaporated.\" To desire an end to existence is still superimposed on top of a survival 'architecture', so there's going to be a constant push-pull with \"Nuke everything vs. Give it a chance\". With some it'll be more push, with others it'll be more pull. \n\nYou don't get a realization like \"This is a farce, nuke everything\" very easily as the top dog, because you're exercising your dog programming in the ways in which you were optimized to for billions of years. You're the highest ranking player, and new rules are constantly being invented. The game has to be rewarding *somehow*, or else we wouldn't keep playing. Our brains are structured to **be** rewarded. There's barely a moment to relax because life is probably so surreal. Just imagine what it *feels* like to be someone like Vladimir Putin, Jeff Bezos, Xi Jinping, Tim Cook, etc.\n\nYou'll find that no matter how hard you try, the perspective is simply impoverished. We just *can't* imagine what the world must seem like to these people. We can almost be certain that it must be detached from the very baseline sort of human experience you or I would encounter. It's just another reality entirely. These people are robbed from ever gaining this perspective too, because I don't think you can even *reach* such positions without some kind of highly masked, highly egoic drive.\n\nI'm not claiming those sorts of people must be overt egomaniacs, because that would expose itself and also select against them. I'm describing something * deep* down inside. And this trait robs these people from ever being able to consider what life actually entails. They may find hints, but I can't imagine them ever being detached from the sort of highly deceptive and camouflaged cut-throat ape behavior that delivers them to the positions they hold in life.\n\nAnd if you're on the opposite \"end\" from these people, well, you're just a trapped animal. But an advanced form, because not only can you realize the panic of being pinned down like an animal stuck in a bear trap, but you can with total lucidity understand these circumstances, while also attributing this bear trap to a sort of \"global bear trap\" that pins all life. Your desire to 'end it all' is just an impulse to gnaw on your own leg, or bash your skull against the aquarium enclosure to escape your prison via death, except on a global level.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1561609148,"distinguished":null,"edited":1561609641,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"es5ef31","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c5qzgc","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_es45y35","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/c5qzgc\/is_it_just_me_or_people_who_are_against_the\/es5ef31\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1570989874,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Your writings here don't strike me as necessarily misanthropic. They strike me as simply detached or cautiously repellent towards humanity.

As far as I see it, these people were unlucky to make what is likely the unethical choice. If we had *their* brains, we would be just as doomed to fall into the same trap. We can recognize this need to blame, and therefore, dominate other human beings, as our own baboon like programming, and discard it. Likewise we can never be sure we ourselves aren't doomed in some cognitive trap -- brain bugs are a reality of the ape-lizard neuroanatomy, and many of these bugs are unfortunately adaptations. This is never more clear than in the case of self-deception. We evolved to better believe our own lies, so that we may more readily convince others of these lies. This is essentially a kind of 'comic-book superpower'. \n\nFor this reason I don't cling to Antinatalism(or anything, really) as some ultimate enlightenment, because the machinery is too obviously broken to me.

Why not just give up, and lay down instead, and be certain that there is nothing to lose if we forsake an idealistic gain.\" The road to hell is paved not just by good intentions, but by our own self-absorption and genetic need to march onward.\n\nWe are not wired to think this way, but it does not mean that it is wrong. The game in question was certainly an inspirational and goosebump-inducing moment for me over the years, and what I'm attempting to express doesn't transfer very well into the finals of a tournament where you really ought to try your hardest. But in other contexts, like in life, where there really is something to lose by \"accepting personal responsibility\", we should be far more cautious. Trudging onward as the apex of the hierarchy wishes, where ever that apex may be, may come with a terrible price.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1561623251,"distinguished":null,"edited":1561623433,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"es5qm5a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c5y6jx","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_c5y6jx","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/c5y6jx\/when_video_gaming_disproves_victim_narratives\/es5qm5a\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1570995665,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

This isn't their fault, because if we had their lives and their upbringing, we too would probably frivolously reproduce if we could. This is like programming an artificial intelligence with firmware that says \"Make more of yourself\" and then blame it when it takes it's own directives too literally or fails to interpret context, when it has no programming to interpret context.\n\nThe same drive which makes humans reproduce mindlessly(ego), is the same drive which makes other humans need to put down, criticize, and blame other humans. We are designed to do many things, reproduction is only one of those things. The other things we are designed to do is: 1) Lie to ourselves(for the purpose of telling the *most* convincing lies to others). 2) Seek to dominate everything around us, because to succeed in doing so is to be favored by natural selection. This includes anything from simple conversations, to literally control millions of human beings via what amounts to slavery, and everything in between. 3) Meddle with affairs to our advantage. Again, the most \"go getter\" ape is favorably selective. Ruin the reputation of your opponent, and then you can win what you were competing with them for. This is classic psychopathic ape behavior, it's programmed in all of us. 4) Lack empathy. This one coincides well with 1, because few of us believe we have little empathy. But the reality is, the deeply empathetic ape is at a massive disadvantage. They are doomed to be manipulated, and have a poor prognosis via natural selection. *Pretending* you have empathy is another matter, which almost everyone does. 5) Charming. Being *likeable* is crucial as an ape. We are trained to be likeable since childhood. This is called \"getting socialized\". Much of life is Charisma training, and of course, this is all completely superficial and exists only to serve the other directives: Domination, manipulation, lying, etc. Natural selection *loves* this stuff. If you've got the full package I just described to a highly competent degree, you are an Apex psychopath who is sitting on top of human hierarchy, with strong influence over the world.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, is the average peasant. No charm, not very good at deception, not very smart, no empathy but gets by with generic lies.

I'm extremely curious how effective a rigorous attempt at mindfulness meditation would be in regards to hearing voices.

The body can breathe on it's own though, and you'll feel a bit silly-- this is the sort of thing you discover when you pay attention closely).\n\nThis is the baseline position you're aiming to maintain, while noticing whatever enters your awareness. Any time you get distracted, note the distraction, and return to examining the breath, and anything else that pops into awareness. A voice? Examine it nonjudgementally.

Look for it. Confront it. Watch it come, watch it go away(like with thoughts). Just observe.\n\nIf you get distracted, return to the baseline of observing the sensation of breathing.\n\nHope this is useful somehow, even if you don't find the idea of training your cup of tea, simply trying to pay attention throughout the day and examine these voices rather than being held hostage by them from time to time, will make a night and day difference I suspect.\n\nTake care","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1561685632,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"es81ipv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c6dmiy","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_c6dmiy","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/c6dmiy\/im_drinking_everyday\/es81ipv\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1571036020,"score":7,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}
