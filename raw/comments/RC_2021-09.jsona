He has this very funny talk, it's linked in the description.\n\nFrom here, Andres describes the author he's speaking about at a conference where this author describes some sort lucid-dream level psychedelic experience where he can close his eyes, and just manifest objects(table is the example used) in the eyes-closed visual field, and just have total control of everything. How it appears, how it's decorated, what angle you are viewing this simulated object from-- an object which is supposedly totally indistinguishable from the real object.\n\nAll of this is fine. There's no need to doubt this, this is the sort of thing we'd expect on a large dose of psychedelics + luck(I'd still be utterly amazed, no doubt). But there's really just no need to introduce the term \"Free will\" into the description of what is happening here. Let's look again at the quoted text from the youtube video:\n\n\"you are able to control the content of your experience at will\".\n\nOkay... well... if we're speaking fundamentally, you can do that right this second. Raise your right arm. You are now controlling the content of your experience. Pinch yourself. You're controlling the content of your experience. Close your eyes, and superimpose a tree somewhere into the darkness of your visual field. Most people can do this completely sober. It may be very blurry and faint, but something will be there(some people really do lack the neurology to pull this off, I forget what the term for that is).\n\nAll of this is \"controlling the content of your experience at will\". But is there any *free* will involved? No, of course not. All of this is utterly impinged on by the substrate. You're not \"freely doing\" anything, you're just a puppet of causes who can't see the causes. And if you could see the causes, whatever you decide to either go with or against those causes, would *itself* be impinged on yet more causes. Everything is **pure** causality, zero \"Free will\". Words like 'free' still have utility, of course. No one is extorting you for all of your money right now to do x vs. y, so you're \"free\" in that sense. You're not in jail, nor are you in a cocoon of a full roll of duct tape. But your *will* is not free. Your will is perfectly enslaved by causality and nothing more-- so you're free to do what you will(obvious), but you're not free to will what you will-- there's no \"Self-determinacy\". There's no \"magical pulling up via one's bootstraps\". There's nothing at all that *implies* a separation from causality-- all of this is logically impossible, and crucially, this is what **most people on planet Earth think is happening** when we say \"free will\".\n\nThis is why the term \"free will\" is such a harm-- because off of this idea, we get punishment, we get cruelty, we get bias, we torture people for crimes they were doomed to commit, we justify cruelty to animals(We're superior, we earned it, etc), we hold things against people in which they had no ultimate say in the matter, etc. Free will is like, a core pillar, that holds up much of the suffering on earth. It's not the root of all evil, but it's certainly a pillar that scaffolds it, along with lies, and sadism. \n\n\n* You can still torture a person in a prison cell without being a sadist or a liar if you believe free will justifes their punishment. \n\n* You can still torture a person in a prison cell without being a sadist or believing in free will, if you are a liar. \n\n* You can still torture a person in a prison cell without being a liar or while understanding there is no free will, if you are a sadist.\n\nBut if you are neither a sadist, neither a liar, and you understand that free will is incoherent and understand the ethical implications of that, then it is impossible to torture someone in a prison cell to the same degree of rationality as it would be to torture a dog for the crime of not bursting into whale song.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630470156,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hb5dkgk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pf4fh9","locked":false,"name":"t1_hb5dkgk","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pf4fh9","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/pf4fh9\/freewheeling_hallucinations_be_the_freewilled_god\/hb5dkgk\/","retrieved_on":1650393986,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I mentioned that in the AR01 thread. Is nature \"the wilderness\"? Is nature \"Everything that is alive right now\"? Or is nature simply physics? If it's' simply physics, then DNA emerges from the substrate of physics, like a seed+soil+sunlight+moisture produces a plant. Then, someone may ask, why don't we just say physics is evil or matter is evil? Physics and matter make DNA, after all, and that's what makes evil possible.\n\nSo *why* am I pinpointing it on DNA here? The reason is, physics *alone*(laws of a universe) don't guarantee life-mechanics and therefore suffering. Nor does matter. You could, in principle, have a universe of rocks and therefore no evil. You could also have a universe in principle containing laws, but no matter for those laws to work on-- again, no evil, no suffering, dead universe. \n\nBut you cannot have a universe where there is no evil, while DNA is allowed to thrive, replicate, evolve, and generate [phenomenology](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PcnH_TOqi3I) and [nervous systems](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo), generate unethical strategies to win the replication game, causing constant expansion of conscious experience, greater scopes and scales of suffering, constant distillation of a \"most evil being in existence\"(&lt;-- This is **constantly** growing, perfecting, improving-- this is what evolution does, so in some sense, **something like** the \"Great Old Ones\" Lovecraft imagined are possibly real right now, or possibly will be real in the totality of spacetime).\n\nThis is why DNA I think and life-mechanics are the most ethically salient point in any existence. It's not about \"destroying the universe\", it's not about \"destroying matter\", it's not about \"Turning off **all** of the laws of physics\", but to be the greatest hero in the totality of reality, one would simply make two conditions true: a) all life mechanics cease in the totality of reality, and b) no new life mechanics can emerge in the totality of reality for infinity. If anyone was to use magic and do this, there would be no greater hero in the **totality** of existence. Shutting down the power of the greatest heaven in existence, and painlessly euthanizing all of the citizens of heaven, would be considered a *steal* to acquire this achievement. This means permanently stopping **One hundred percent** of hell, **absolutely**. One would not only be a God, they would be the perfection of God-like benevolence, to achieve this.\n\nOne would also be a moral monster to be in a position to form this move but instead say \"Hmm, you know what?

I'm not sure if it's the *feelings* or the *experiences* that are intrinsically ineffable, but there's no question that sometimes it seems that way. I think it seems that way because of how our different neurologies and psychologies work, and all these different barriers between conscious things using a pattern system or noise or symbols to communicate between each other. Although I've definitely sympathized with what you're saying before. I've mostly lived a life of frustration, particularly when younger, at other people being simply dull or resistant to facts about experience and any conclusions that can be derived from it.\n\nSo to me, just fully appreciating the problem of something like [the egocentric predicament](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egocentric_predicament), or the [hot-cold empathy gap](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Empathy_gap) or just how dramatically different human brains and human phenomenologies could be, was as game changer.\n\nI'm very open to being convinced. I've choked on smoke before, certainly, from say a barbecue taking place in a public park or a kitchen mistake or walking past some kind of charcoal grilling street vendor. I've had second degree burns and countless first degree burns before. I've felt a kind of claustrophobic panic before if I got stuck in something, perhaps as a child. I've been scalded by a shower before, which gives me the \"full-body\" effect. And so on.\n\nSo these things clearly *help* me understand the concept of being burned alive. And I'm confident that if I could somehow simulate the real thing and live to tell about it, there's no question I'd come back and say \"It's much worse than you can imagine. It can't be put into words\" and so on. But really the more detail I think we put into describing it, the more likely it is for dots to connect. It's not that I have *absolutely* no idea what it's like. I'm certain it's bad.\n\nSince we're conscious creatures, we by definition have *some* sense of \"bad\". So the more and more effort we put into describing some deeply distant phenomenology that we've never experienced, eventually, we will connect the dots somehow. We will come closer and closer to gaining understanding. I think this is the crucial part of what you wrote:\n\n&gt; Even a painting of such an event works only if I engage in that sort of active conceptualization, and I have to use my own body as a reference point.\n\n&gt; But by doing that, I get a much deeper level of understanding of what is happening, and most importantly, WHY IT IS SIGNIFICANT. This is the way that VALUE is recognized.\n\nI'm trying to imagine a way where everything you described gets its box ticked, *except* value is not recognized. And I return to my own theory of why we can't converge on values. I think values really depend on traits. There are certain kinds of people who will simply never admit to valuing such a thing. Or there are certain kinds of people who will never recognize that certain values are worth pursuing over others. \n\nWhy does this happen? Because of traits, right? What else could it be. A person must be a certain way, as a fact of their psychology and upbringing and experiences and genetics, and so on. This is how it's possible to deeply understand something, but consider it insignificant and not admit it is valuable. It's possible to say: \"Who cares if every being in the totality of reality is tortured perfectly in their own way, for infinity?-- It's not like that's *actually* bad or something.\", *while* having a fairly sophisticated understanding of all the mechanics involved. And this sounds utterly counterintuitive, but this is simply because *other* variables are operative there, in the form of traits. Anything from deception to sadomasochism or some sort of odd ontological orientation.\n\nPerhaps when you say experiences are ineffable, and when I say the way we are make them so, we're really just talking about the same thing. Ted Bundy absolutely insisted on his innocence with an extreme level of confidence until he died. As he was being dragged away for execution. That's how the brain works-- it convinces itself of its own lie, sheer psychosis, **even** in the face of all of the facts. Many of us know what this is like because we've almost certainly had an encounter with someone in the past who had a mind-boggling degree of confidence even when all the evidence was plain to see. I've known people like this, where it's just beyond what words like \"self-deception\" capture and into sheer psychosis. \n\nJust imagine someone absolutely covered up to their neck in excrement, going(It helps to impose a voice like Donald Trump's or something): \"I am NOT covered in shit! You think I'm covered in shit?! YOU'RE full of shit. You're the one covered in shit, shithead. Look at you. You're disgusting. You WISH you were as clean as I am right now. WISH. You WISH that, got it?!\" \n\nThat is something *like* the human brain, in general. That captures the banality of human psychosis and self-deception and narrative formation, even when we've actually been given more than enough data. This is why experience isn't enough-- because there's been so much experience in the last 1Billion years that should have produced such immense values orientation(and even effability), yet it has failed for the most part. It seems like the precise opposite happened.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630480597,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hb5scfu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pe5d4c","locked":false,"name":"t1_hb5scfu","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_hay5h0h","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/pe5d4c\/philosophical_stance\/hb5scfu\/","retrieved_on":1650392188,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I feel free in my ability to resist responding, but we ought to know that's a fantasy. My best attempt at making sense of this:\n\n&gt; Humans have domesticated animals for a long time, and for a variety of purposes: wolves and dogs as guard animals, horses and donkeys as transport animals, others just as loyal companions. We have used much creativity when it comes to the means used to domesticate them, but most approaches boil down to the old carrot and stick principle.\n\n&gt; What all of the traditional and familiar approaches to domestication have in common is that they seem to be compatible with the idea that the animals are agents, exercising their free will. Granted, we do motivate, coerce, and perhaps even manipulate animals. But, it seems, we only interact with the animal from the outside, in principle the animal could have done otherwise than to do our bidding.\n\n&gt; This is about to change. Recent advances in microelectronics allow us to domesticate animals in ways we never thought possible. Meet the remote controlled flower beetle: on its back he carries a miniature radio receiver which is connected to electrodes which are implanted in its optic lobes. Oscillating electrical pulses trigger a take-off, a single short pulse ceases the flight. \n\n It saddens me to say that the highest, most redeeming point my imagination reaches is that the author is being deliberately dishonest through some sort of good intention about triggering intuitions about free will. Because I genuinely fail to imagine how someone could think this *while* speaking about literal manipulation of beings who have zero comprehension that they're being manipulated and say, \"animal domestication is compatible with animals exercising their free will\".\n\nIf you programmed a crude, conscious AI mechanical rabbit, to have two functions based on different scenarios:\n\na) A seeking\/compliance with any carrot acquisition opportunity that responds to the audio cue of \"Here bunny bunny\" and the visual cue of a carrot\n\nb) Self-destruct by setting itself on fire in certain scenarios that don't involve carrot acquisition, and don't involve the audio cue of \"Here bunny bunny\" and the visual cue of a carrot\n\n And waved a carrot nearby, saying \"Here bunny bunny\", this robot setting themselves on fire would be completely incoherent behavior. It's oriented to the carrot. The programming says \"Go do this, when x\/y\/z occurs\". No one in their right mind would call this free will. We wrote the code, we know how the rabbit will behave. But now if you just make all of this super complex, suddenly people think somewhere, there's freedom that emerges. There's no freedom with 1 out of 2 choices, and there's no freedom out of 1 out of 900 trillion choices. There are choices, yes, but precisely zero free choices. In objective, reality based, fact based terms, there is zero freedom. \n\nIt's a similar kind of failure of intuition as the Monty Hall problem. You see all these choices, and you *feel* like you can make any, but due to the largeness of the problem, you are blind to how utterly enslaved you are, fundamentally. In the Monty hall problem it's backwards, you're so fine grained and zoomed in, that you actually can't see that if you just zoomed the problem out, the right answer is very obvious. Only zoomed in does a failure of intuition occur. People who believe in free will are in a sense suffering this way, they don't understand personal identity is pure causal soup, they feel like a \"Me\", they perhaps suffer from some kind of existential anxiety around not being free, or maybe they think free will is an important lie in some ethical sense(Daniel Dennett sometimes gives off this vibe), they feel detached from causality somehow, so all kinds of hilarious errors emerge from this.\n\n Usually people will admit that animals don't have free will, and attribute humans with some special form of higher order cognition that can exercise free will, but it's stunning how someone could think that forcefully tying up an animal, mounting it until it has no choice but to comply, has any free will involved. Then, when the animal is totally exhausted, coaxing it and manipulating it in every way possible where the only real options are starvation\/death(not *free*, since all living things are oriented against killing themselves-- no one freely chooses when they die, including those who deliberate for years, meticulously planning their suicide with total certainty), or compliance.\n\n This is the perfection of how absurd we get when we try to take certain meanings of \"free will\" seriously. Even the least laughable definitions of \"Free will\" make room for calling certain scenarios not free. In humans, if you have a gun to your head, most compatabilists would admit you're not free(unless I'm just deeply confused about what they actually believe, and this post is a typical view. I hope it isn't). Only an imbecile would say, \"You still have a choice! You could always choose getting your brains blown out! :)\"\n\n So just look at what a scenario where one is not free looks like: Recognize that the gun is a causal variable that forces you to do something. Right? Now imagine if the gun was invisible and did not enter your consciousness. Would the decision suddenly be free? No, of course not-- there's still a *thing* forcing you, you just aren't *aware* that you're being forced(To be clear, the gun is still triggering *all* the same neurological decision making mechanisms, you're just not *aware*-- It's forcing you to hand over  the money because if you don't you'll die, but from your subjective experience, you instead think \"Oh, I'm just being nice :)\" ). \n\nYou feel like you're making the decision, creating it, and that you could have picked any other decision. But what's really happening is there's an unrecognizable gun to your head forcing you to do something **precisely** like those remote controlled beetles are being forced.\n\nFrom here, simply recognize that **all of reality** contains just potential or literal \"invisible\/unrecognizable guns to your head\" in 100% of cases. And this includes cases where there are **visible** guns to your head. It is the **invisible** guns that must be crucially absent for freedom, not simply the absence of **visible** guns. This is why the idea of free will is incoherent.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630523810,"distinguished":null,"edited":1630552504.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hb829q9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pfs07b","locked":false,"name":"t1_hb829q9","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_pfs07b","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/pfs07b\/sphexishness_a_wasps_attack_on_free_will\/hb829q9\/","retrieved_on":1650381889,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I can imagine a dramatic difference for example between the most pathological form of civilization, and the least pathological. Class difference is a problem to humanity because of how psychopathic our species is. If we could design a simulation with a truly non-psychopathic, deeply mentally healthy species, and just plug in the sorts of things people claim are problems: \"Capitalism\", or \"Civilization\" in this case, then I predict you'd see something radically different, because I identify the problem in terms of local suffering to be humanity, and in truly open ended scope, to be life machinery. But this doesn't mean that heavens aren't possible, or benevolent civilizations aren't possible in the laws of physics. I can't imagine there not being a rich civilization gradient, we're just suffering from a kind of myopia as humans because we happen to be the only civilization-level species we have access to.\n\nThere's nothing inherently bad about labor, resource acquisition, and labor force. It's who does it, and how they do it, that problems emerge. \n\n&gt; You have to realize that the base prevents what you hope for. No techno-utopian and mass societies, can be anything but dystopias in practice. Just like the delusions of life in the natural world can only be a waste. Civilizations are always a part of the bad game of evolution.\n\nI agree with you in practice, in the sense of \"we've got human history and Earth and our current species to work with\". I think *this* specific project is probably doomed. But when I care about what is true, I care about what is true in principle, not in practice. Because if I only look at humanity, I'm going to get a flawed representation of what is true\/possible.\n\nIt's not that evolution can't get *lucky* and spawn a civilization that exhibits the traits and values of someone like [Thich Nhat Hanh](https:\/\/youtu.be\/NJ9UtuWfs3U?t=34) in a global, cultural sense. It can't happen on Earth it seems because psychopaths running on exploitation and domination models seem to win over time. And if it avoided this, then an alien species could always arrive that *does* exhibit the traits of someone like Jeff Bezos or a first world superpower's military industrial complex, and then there will be no negotiation, just like there is no negotiation with a black hole whose event horizon you've reached. You are simply doomed, and sheer power is impinged on you.\n\nBut to know what is truly true, we must look in principle. We need to use thought experiments to distill what the *precise* cause of the problem is. Is it capitalism? Easy to test. Plug in Thich Nhat Hanh into capitalism, in a simulation in our minds. Now, this doesn't mean Thich Nhat Hanh starts a cocaine habit and begins callously exploiting people. It would look **radically** different than what we have today. It would be an efficient economy without the human misery that appears in our world. You can even have some of the elements we consider dystopian today. You could walk into a vegan McDonalds and see identical behavior from the employees and customers that you would see in [this video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W9AlCDVXJc4). Now please entertain what 8 billion copies of [Gertrude Baniszewski](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo) would look like. This is much easier for us to imagine, because we are human, and Baniszewski is much more stereotypically human than Thich Nhat Hanh. She represents the mind state, the attitude, the traits, of the things in power over Earth currently and for the last thousands of years.\n\nAgain, the crucial problem is that by being **inside** the human species, and only seeing the sample size of a single, deeply mentally ill(via evolutionary incentives\/rewards\/game theory) species, we can often point the finger on the wrong problem. The problem is not capitalism or civilization, it's much more fundamental than that-- we can access this truth simply by examining potentially infinite gradients of possibilities of how these systems operate by plugging in and plugging out different kinds of people\/species.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630535446,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hb8t6q1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_peyuwj","locked":false,"name":"t1_hb8t6q1","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_hb8oqpb","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/peyuwj\/my_problems_with_efilism\/hb8t6q1\/","retrieved_on":1650378559,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

And like the horses who pulled ploughs for centuries (and still do in many places), humans seem more like the fuel this now global totalitarian culture\/machine uses to sustain itself with. \n\nOkay, let's test this claim. Let's first ask what \"present situation\" *really* means, in the most meaningful sense. What *captures* the badness of existence? It's shit like [this](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FMepy_THcOg?t=13), and cases of both [small scale](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo) and [large scale\/systematic](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/) human-human torture in any sense.\n\nSo far, so good. We can certainly see tool use. Technology is clearly apparent. And we see that with technological development, all things that can be called bad, if words mean anything at all, appear to be [maximized](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/transcoded\/7\/7a\/342-usaf-11034_Medical_Aspects-Hiroshima.webm\/342-usaf-11034_Medical_Aspects-Hiroshima.webm.480p.vp9.webm) by increased technological development. Civilization is always operative. Okay.\n\nBut is it *really* technology? Civilization? What would falsify this technology\/civilization theory? Well, very simply all we'd need to find is a \"present situation\" of immense badness, where civilization and technology are both **totally absent** from this state. Let's see if we can do that by looking...\n\n* [Here](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall-rhardcorenature)\n\n* [and here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PcnH_TOqi3I)\n\n* [and here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=107)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nWe see a hellworld here. If someone were to inject your conscious awareness into the perspective of one of the things getting eaten alive, this person would be a monster. It would be a crime to do. And yet this is happening on an incomprehensible scale, purely by natural forces, for hundreds of millions of years. So it can't *quite* be technology or civilization-- that seems a bit myopic from this human vantage point, and remember, the author said we don't want to be speciesist. Clearly nothing deserves to suffer pointlessly, and it's a tragedy that immense suffering is forced on living things in such immense scales. This is the recipe for the problem:\n\n* Finite resources\n* Replication machines that compete for resources, which determine their replication\n* No referee to say \"Unethical behavior will be prevented\/disincentivized\"\n\nThis is all you need. Once you get these variables, and \"press play\", you get a hellish world. This is because strategies like eating things alive will be developed-- anything goes, in fact. All bets are off. Whatever wins wins, however it wins. These winning strategies are then encoded into the hardware and software of the descendant winners, ensuring that the most diabolical strategies get further refined. Civilization and technology are merely *byproducts* of this problem, but they are not the fundamental problem. We can also imagine civilizations that contain nothing but deeply benevolent beings, in principle. Or technology use dictated by such beings. Will we see our hellworld then? No, of course not. That's what the words \"**deeply** benevolent being\", mean.\n\nAnd we *know* we wouldn't even come close to the horror our civilization achieves, because our species is very obviously not deeply benevolent. And they are not deeply benevolent, not because of civilization itself, not because of technology itself, but because DNA makes things that are not oriented to ethical behavior, which is the formula for hellwords- simply look at the predatory animals for reference. A world with absolutely zero unethical orientation, is by definition not a hellish world as a description of the subjects in it. There's no \"sadist to torture you\". There's no warmonger to drop an atom bomb on you. There's no rapist. There's no child abuse. There's no animal that eats other animals while they're alive. There's no corporate greed or government propaganda or ecological negligence.

Psychopathy, expertly expressed, determines domination. Power will always be synonymous with psychopathy, which is why history appears as it does, and why the present appears as it does.\n\nPeople associate psychopathy with violent criminality, with high profile cases of sadists and murderers, like Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer, etc. But this isn't the case. Psychopathy is a broad concept that we've been deeply confused about. The king, the queen, the head priest, the most powerful CEO, the final economic arbiter, these are all also kinds of \"apex psychopaths\" who are putting on a very tight show-- the kind of show that doesn't result in being put into handcuffs, despite functioning the same way, fundamentally. The game theory here is set up in such a way so that the psychopaths at the top form a kind of ecosystem in dominating all the things at the bottom, this includes both(NSFL) [people](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/), and [animals](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FMepy_THcOg?t=13).\n\nSo it's far broader than trusting doctors about vaccines. The problem of trust is so because many people have been thrown into this reality, lived a truly maddening and difficult life that always has this sinister air to it, but can never put their finger on it. This is an explanation of that. It's quite simply the case that evil rules reality-- this is a very straightforward sentence, but the implications are anything but simple. First of all, if this idea were true, it would be deeply maladaptive and psychologically destabilizing. It would be selected against, which partly explains the dichotomy between optimism bias and the just world fallacy vs. depressive realism. In other words, it's good to be delusional, but bad to in touch with reality, in evolutionary terms. Psychopathy only benefits from this happenstance in the evolutionary game theory, because one can just infinitely obscure that dynastic, powerful psychopaths, have essentially tortured trillions of beings, and will continue to do so, as a function of what they are: Genetic domination machines.\n\n\"It's a big club-- but you ain't in it.\" -- George Carlin","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630613377,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hbcxvzw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pgnhg7","locked":false,"name":"t1_hbcxvzw","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_pgnhg7","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/pgnhg7\/how_to_regain_trust\/hbcxvzw\/","retrieved_on":1650360340,"score":15,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

This option takes a lot of skill and wisdom to do well and not even that is a guarantee.\n\nAnother option is to be cruel to us, out of spite. They could say, \"Now I'm going to teach you a lesson! Now you're going to learn what it *really* feels like, to do what you're doing.\" This is another option, right?\n\nNow lets just focus on this third option. What is it like, to experience this? We're just minding our own business, and out of nowhere, something bad happens. Or we realize something bad has been happening. Where is the lesson here, exactly? What does it say about this person who is putting this much energy to cause us harm? They not only have harmed us, out of \"revenge\"-- so this means a kind of *personal* satisfaction, but there's no guarantee anything has changed for us. \n\nThis person actually believes they have the right to cause harm to others to \"teach them lessons\". What does it say about this person who is hurting us? What if they are not convinced we learned our lesson? What then, do they keep \"teaching us lessons\"? How insane would this be? Is this some kind of \"learning environment\"? No, of course not. This is all insane behavior, and no one would \"learn\" from this.\n\nWhat is really happening is, this person is lying to themselves. They have a sadistic, malicious desire, and then they invent a story about how their behavior is \"right\" to more easily allow themselves to be malicious towards others. So it would be helpful to recognize this very carefully, and then also recognize that it's never worth having this kind of attitude. It's not our right to cause people harm just to \"teach them\"-- it's abusive. We would never want someone to do this to us, and this is why we should never do it to someone else.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630619105,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hbdb9r7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pg6tn4","locked":false,"name":"t1_hbdb9r7","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pg6tn4","permalink":"\/r\/Schizotypal\/comments\/pg6tn4\/what_would_you_call_someone_like_me\/hbdb9r7\/","retrieved_on":1650358767,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizotypal","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlzo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizotypal","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Sometimes you'll encounter people who really get a super serious negative reaction, and you may think, \"huh... that's weird. That seems a bit extreme\".

There are a few problems with psychiatry and our culture around the idea of suicide. You know your parents mean well, so that's good of you to recognize, but the problem here is there is an empathy gap between your parents and yourself. They simply cannot recognize just how much pain you're in-- they're very far from the state of mind that says: \"Death is an *emergency*... I can't *take* this any longer\" There's also no doubt that you probably struggle to put yourself in their frame of mind, as parents. It's certain they are suffering in a unique way too.\n\nBut just simply imagine how they would behave if they had *crystal clear* empathy here-- and they truly felt how awful one must feel to not only have suicidal thoughts, but to **act** on suicide. This is simply a tragedy for everyone-- your parents are robbed of the expression of the good intentions they would likely offer you, and you're robbed of parents who deeply understand you in your most dire need. There's no one to blame here. You are not to blame for this, you were simply dealt a terrible hand here, that no one deserves. Your parents aren't to blame, they can't be other than what they are-- and they seem to be trying their best, which unfortunately in our world is often just not enough.\n\nWhat psychiatry does is it sort of adds fuel to this fire by implying that you are somehow broken, and that the treatment for your problem is in the form of some pill, when it's even possible that you've identified the thing that traumatized you. This *amplifies* an already present feeling of madness. It's like being tortured in a dungeon for 10 years, escaping after being stabbed repeatedly by a psychopath, and then you get to some doctors, and they diagnose you with \"hemophilia\" and prescribe you anticoagulants and imply to you that you're the problem. It's quite insane.\n\nSo your frustration and general suffering here is normal, but it will help a lot to just understand this situation more clearly. I think a lot of suffering comes from not totally understanding, or forgetting the things we do understand. If you very clearly, kindly, and calmly try to understand(just like many of the people you've met in life who no doubt failed to treat you with this attitude), then suffering goes away. This may even improve things for both you and your parents, because suffering going away can sometimes be like a feedback loop. Your suffering goes down, your parents suffering goes down, then your suffering goes down again as a result, etc. It's just about triggering that chain reaction by first very clearly and non-judgmentally recognizing the situation.

I think the subject was just the state of the world, and he was on the \"pessimistic team\" opposing Steven Pinker who is known as one of the most optimistic pop-sci authors. (This is only from memory, so some of this could be off). But the book is basically all about how the most successful people(from Bill Gates to star athletes, and so on) are profoundly lucky, and it details all the absurdly extraordinary happenstance that had to have happened to them, to become what they were. And if just *one* variable is off, then it could very well be that they'd just be nobodies, or very plain, or a little above average. It's not overtly said in the book, but the takeaway message(at least for me) is \"Life is deeply unfair and arbitrary, and we punish and reward people based on utterly arbitrary happenstance\".

You'll make them more resilient alright, but you'll also create such shockwaves of mental illness and send the Earth to hell in the process. It's like setting a house on fire so the fire department could rescue it. It's just backwards thinking in a similar sense, which is why I would dismiss that argument. There's simply no good argument that justifies factory farming as it appears today.\n\n&gt; I think it is too early to be confident if veganism is helping lowering the number of bred&amp;killed animals, but it seems that the number of slaughtered mammals is either stagnant or decreasing. However, the number of chicken and fish sacrificed is ever-increasing, possibly because it is not so easy for humans to be empathetic to them. \n\n It could be a little worse than that, actually. Regardless of where trends are going, I think it's a good thing that veganism exists even if I don't think the specific economic moves doesn't seem to affect animal torture(the most controversial idea, partly because people have very simplistic understandings of economics). It's good that there's a cultural movement that raises awareness about animal torture. People have to know this problem exists both in ethical terms and in large scale terms, before we can actually solve it, but solving it is far more complex than just making certain choices at the supermarket I believe. The actual stats on meat consumption trends [don't see very favorable](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=107). \n\nOne problem with this data, even though it does show a slight increase in pork, a large increase in chicken, and a decline in beef, does seem to rest on consumption, not production. Wish I had access to more information about these graphs but there's not a super precise relationship necessarily between *production*, and consumption. Ethically, consumption is trivial compared to *production*, which is ethically crucial. The graph also does not seem to correct for population changes. My personal suspicion is the facts about the ethical situation are worse than the data reveals.\n\nBack to the data we do have-- this data is compatible with a net increase in cows, pigs, and chickens being tortured despite veganism going up. And what does *that* mean? That people should stop being vegan? No, of course not, I don't think so. Veganism is important regardless of the economic impacts it has or doesn't have, but it may be crucial to develop effective strategies that actually reliably end animal torture. And we should simply acknowledge that, and [stop pretending like certain strategies **certainly** work](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/vegan\/comments\/ncrzoe\/found_an_app_that_says_how_many_animals_water\/)(*note below), and really are economically simple, all the while being sanctimonious, tribal, and hostile to fellow human beings. \n\nVeganism would profoundly increase in effectiveness if even the most ambitious meat eater on Earth was not the target of even a drop of vitriol, resentment, anger, ostracism, contempt, etc. Fortunately, there are more and more creatively thinking vegans these days that can recognize this problem isn't that simple, or recognize that moralizing people does more harm than good towards vegan values, which every ethical person should share regardless of dietary values(these are two distinct things, if we're being precise). I've seen a minor who was known to be in very psychologically abusive home environment get bullied to the point of social ostracism and cruelty for simply not being vegan-- this sort of thing isn't rare, and is along the lines of certain vegans behaving at their worst, and have truly lost a grip on the plot ethically.\n\n*(An app like this for example I think is harmful, because it gives a kind of dopaminergic reward and satisfaction to someone and a *certainty* that they actually saved animals by eating certain things, when reality easily may not work this way. The torturers in the animal industry don't walk in and go \"Whelp Bessie, Looks like it's your turn to peacefully exit. Another one of those darn vegans saving animals again.\" or \"Whelp, time to lock this enclosure for good! No more cows will be tortured here, bloody vegans keep buying lentils! Grrr\" None of that actually happens at the largest scope\/scale. Meat just gets cheaper(seems to be happening), more animals get tortured(could easily be happening), or animal torture stays roughly the same(could easily be happening). Like I said, we still need vegans, we need a vegan culture, we need a set of cultural norms broadly speaking, but it's unclear how to really perfectly min-max veganism so that more dramatic reductions in animal torture occur, and that we also do not cause human suffering in the process by being hostile or groupish. I am cynical about this problem being solved, and think veganism will ultimately find itself in a schism between militants\/fundamentalists, and goodwilled\/moderates-- this is what happens to most religions, and this will only hurt veganism, and therefore, hurt animals.

What's going on in the spirit of this photo is a kind of fantasy narrative where the fish think they're \"The good guy, the benevolent freedom fighters\", and the shark is \"The bad guy, the predator, the thing that exploits, causes harm\". This is an easy mistake to make, especially as a fish-- anyone who can associate with the fish can discover this.\n\nBut really, the fish are the predators too-- they're just not in a position of power. So the fish end up creating political and cultural narratives(just as the Shark does) to orient themselves towards predator vs. predator combat. The fish tell themselves \"The Shark is the root of all evil-- we just need to gang up and take out this Shark, then we can bring in the fish utopia\". The sharks tell themselves \"Look how badass we are-- we're the apex predator. We *earned* this. If the fish deserved our position, they'd be sharks or beat the sharks. After all, we're crucial to the ecosystem or else the environment would get destabilized without us controlling the fish populations. That's why we earn our place as their torturers and rulers.\"\n\nBoth narratives are of course sheer self-serving fantasy-- but these fantasies end up benefiting the shark more than anyone else. Everything in the picture runs on DNA. Everything running on DNA is looking to maximally exploit its environment, and this includes strategies around inventing cultural and political narratives. The moment the fish win, it's the same hierarchical bullshit all over again-- more shark\/fish dichotomies, competing to express power. The thing that gains power, is by definition, the new oppressor. You cannot be in a power dynamic without some *bad* element-- it's bad by *nature*. The monarch may feel good(or the monarch may feel like some kind of entitled narcissist and still be complaining despite being monarch-- it's by always wanting *more*, always *doing*, that hierarchy emerges in the first place).\n\nEverything is pure power expression, and this power expression is encoded in DNA, which is then let loose on the changing environment it has been adapted to. What is power expression exactly? What does it *mean* to express power, in plain words?\n\n* It means domination. Without traits that *cause* domination, there's no power. It's meaningless. Imagine a thing that simply **never** dominates anything in any way shape, sense or form, in practice. That thing can't be powerful in a meaningful way.\n\n* It means callousness. How could something be truly powerful, if it deeply cares about other beings, the beings it can in principle express power over? Imagine two identical things, with identical power. Now imagine one is *totally* callous, like the worst humans on Earth. Which one wins, if they just fight forever? It should be obvious that the thing which deeply cares about the wellbeing of the thing it is fighting against, can't win such a game if you just keep replaying the game over and over.\n\n* It means self-absorption\/egomania\/narcissism. What could it possibly mean to be deeply powerful, yet have total egolessness? Just zero self-identity, zero drives, zero sense of self, there's no \"Me me me me\" voice in their head, there's no \"I'm special, I'm great, I deserve this, I *want* things\" there's no envy, no greed, there's no subject-object duality from this thing's perspective **whatsoever**. Could such a thing be very successful in expressing power? \n\n* It means manipulation\/scheming\/fucking with things. How could this *help* someone achieve power? How could it help to constantly provoke everything around you? How could it help to constantly, superficially, improve how you are seen by people, and sabotage your enemies? Would something that does absolutely none of this have the advantage in gaining and keeping power, or something that constantly is oriented to manipulate?\n\n* It means deception. Could the ability to convince someone of falsehoods be helpful for power? Is the ability to spread propaganda effectively power? Is the ability to literally alter someone's representation of reality in a malicious and untrue way, power? This includes one's own, by the way. Could convincing oneself of self-serving lies be useful in telling the most compelling lies? \"I am supporting the revolution\" \"I am a noble monarch\" \"My view is best\" \"I have good intentions\" \"Right and wrong don't really matter\" \"I am better than you\"\n\n* It means fearlessness, low risk aversion, low self-awareness. Imagine a powerful thing that is utterly paralyzed by fear. It's like a square circle, this idea is simply incoherent. Immense power *means* fearlessness, even in spite of extreme risk. This is a kind of \"stupidity\" that is useful. Because the risk really exists-- it's there. One is just *dumb* in a very narrow way where there's no way to appreciate how risky it is, or care about consequences. We've painted a very nasty picture so far, so is it possible that having a failure, an inability to **self-reflect** on this nastiness can be seen as a kind utility? Being a monster, **plus** being unable to truly *recognize* that one is a monster? Again, compare and contrast. Two monsters-- one knows they are a monster, one cannot know. Which opens the door more towards \"I'm the good guy here!\" narratives? Which more easily allow for bad behavior?\n\n* It means sadomasochism. This is like a combination of callousness + the former traits. It's callous to others, because such a thing is motivated to cause harm to others. It's callous to oneself, because one doesn't care\/can't care about the consequences to themselves-- in fact, harm to themselves actually motivates them. Sadomasochism is a trait of evil, and you can characterize it by the TV trope of some sort of action movie where the antagonist is fighting some lower character, confidently takes the enemy's best shot, which draws blood. The antagonist dramatically reaches up to check the blood with their hand, tastes it, flashes a sadistic grin, and then begins to relish brutalizing this person. Sadism alone is not as effective. The same for masochism alone. As a sadist, one could be motivated to harm others, but one doesn't want harm to come to oneself. A masochist has no motivation to harm others, but they can effectively take a beating. A sadomasochist gets the best of both worlds strategically, and is motivated to hit you, enjoy it, and then you can't even return their own strategy against them as effectively because they enjoy *that*, too. This is why this trait is crucial game theoretically to color, to enrich, to characterize evil. \"The thing that is oriented to cause harm and be unharmed\".\n\n* It means charm. Charm is all the bad things above, completely obscured, as a form of [camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv), which we know can evolve in very sophisticated ways with enough time. It is the [charming smile](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cmp43eP.png) that wraps all of this up.\n\n* It means shamelessness\/guiltlessness. All of the above *could* be solved. Potentially. Except... this one final fail-safe that ensures power is powerful. Without any possibility of remorse, or ability to reflect(if one could somehow overcome the lack of self-awareness and the presence of egomania), then power truly retains all of its power-generating features. \n\nDo these traits sound familiar? It should be obvious-- this is a description of what we'd informally call a \"psychopath\". Notice also, crucially, that the above traits would make a killer CEO. This is not an accident-- the correlation between psychopathic traits and CEO's\/Bosses\/Political tyrants has been pointed out endlessly at this point. These are also the traits of power. And these are also the traits of evil. By definition, power is synonymous with evil, because one cannot express evil in any meaningful way without power. Imagine the most evil thing in the universe, but make it the least important, least powerful, least impactful thing in the universe. We're talking about square circles again here-- these are incoherent ideas. Evil requires the expression of power. \n\nSo now what does it mean to \"beat\" power? Can you beat it, being good? Why, yes, that's what we're taught from childhood. Surely it's true, all the Disney cartoons, and then fiction books, Marvel Movies, Star Wars, even ancient mythology almost exclusively runs on the formula of \"Good fights Evil-&gt; Good wins\". But if we look closely, is this the case? Invert all of these traits, and you get for certain, one of the nicest beings you could possibly imagine. But this being just gets tortured and destroyed by the traits of power. Only *greater* power, beats power. And to be *greater* power, one simply needs *greater* expression of these traits we listed. To do that, you have to be evil. Just like the second law of thermodynamics says our universe tends to move from order to disorder, these systems of competing beings for power and resources, constantly move towards greater and greater distillation of evil-- as a **law**. It cannot be any other way.\n\nTo spell it out, finally: If the fish beat the shark, it's not a triumph, it's not a revolution, it's simply a manifestation of newer power, a newer evil, which will one day also demand a new school of fish-- this perpetually increases evil in any evolutionary environment by constantly increasing selection pressure, resulting in greater and greater power(like you see with the \"progress\" of the human species, or the \"progress\" of carnivores eating animals while they're alive for almost 1 billion years).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630698946,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hbhiniq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pfwlix","locked":false,"name":"t1_hbhiniq","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pfwlix","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/pfwlix\/oh_the_things_that_we_could_accomplish\/hbhiniq\/","retrieved_on":1650340573,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I actually went to the first Verbal Disputes article, which presents this problem:\n\n&gt; Here is an ancient philosophical puzzle (in slightly modernized form): Cartman is captain of a pirate ship. To motivate his crew he swore that even if the ship sinks he will remain loyal and stay on the ship, and, if it comes down to it, drown with it. His crew, Ike, Clyde, and Butters, are responsible for the maintenance of the ship. Week after week they check the ship for rotten planks and occasionally replace a plank. Eventually they have replaced all the planks. Butters, not the brightest of the bunch, decides to reassemble the decommissioned planks and build his own pirate ship. Once finished, he gets on his own ship and sails out of the port. It takes only a few hours and the ship, built solely from rotten planks, sinks. Cartman finds himself in a difficult situation: must he throw himself into the sea and drown with the ship Butters reassembled from the rotten planks in order to honour his vow, or can he stay safely on his own pirate ship? Is the original pirate ship identical with the one reassembled from the rotten planks, or is it identical with the one safely anchoring in the port? Cartman, interested in his own survival, argues that it is identical with the ship in the port; Ike, sensing an opportunity to become captain himself, argues that it is identical with the sunken ship. Who’s right?\n\nI think this problem reveals a dichotomy in how brains work, that I speak about often, and think is useful to understand our approaches to philosophy\/reality. First ask the question: \"How would a person with autism likely answer this question?\"\n\nImagine polling 50,000 people on the spectrum with only two choices to answer this problem. How is it, that we can **know** the answer to this perfectly scientific question, *without* having done the experiment? Pardon the seeming epistemological overconfidence, but it's really not unreasonable here. It's patently obvious that someone who can be said to be on the spectrum, is **far** more likely to answer that the captain should sink on the ship with the rotten planks. Hopefully this is uncontroversial, and if it sounds that way, just spend a few minutes thinking about it and imagining. This actually reveals something about what we already know, but have not fully articulated. What is the style of thinking we call \"on the spectrum\"? Why does the brain that's oriented *this specific way*, reliably reach this sort of answer?\n\nIt's because this is a strategy for information processing. It's a detail orientation. Each plank is a detail. A set of propositions like \"If planks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...etc., make up ship A, and Captain q says they will die with ship a when it sinks, and ship A is sinking, then Captain q ought to sink with ship A\". It's very mathematical, it's highly oriented to detail, it's \"robotic\"(This, and words like \"Cold\" are often used as a sub-pejorative to the broader pejorative of \"autistic\"). It actually structures our scientific approach(A good thing!). It's pragmatic. It \"works\" in some sense. But clearly, it has flaws. It lacks depth and nuance. It lacks flexibility. It lacks richness(it takes a very, very long time for pragmatic approaches to reach idealistic richness).\n\nNow we can see *another* orientation, what I call \"pattern orientation\". If autism spectrum disorder is pathological detail orientation, then something like schizophrenia is pathological pattern orientation. It would not look at this from some bottom up, detail+detail+detail = answer, sense. But rather I imagine it almost works *backwards* if anything. It starts with a big picture, by searching for **meaning**. It's a \"find the pattern\" game. What's the *point* here, it may ask? What is the *essence* of meaning here? When the captain makes their claim about \"this ship\", what are they **really** saying? Are they really saying \"these atoms\"? Or are they actually, in more depth, nuance, richness, saying, \"The ship that I most associate with at any given time-- that is conceptually, but not necessarily in the literally physical sense, linked to my identity\"?\n\nSurely, a verbal dispute-- but not merely so. The verbal dispute is the tip of the iceberg, and the mechanics behind the verbal dispute are detail vs. pattern orientation-- two different(but not incompatible) strategies for forming a picture of reality.\n\nIt is in this very strict example, that we see that the detail orientation could have a disadvantage. Of course, this doesn't mean it's doomed. It doesn't mean one approach is necessarily *better*  than the other. The detail oriented approach can *still* use axioms, as loopholes, to cover for its weakness in being pattern-obtuse. Likewise, the pattern orientation has a potential weakness in simply finding the wrong pattern-- its approach is less pragmatic. But what tends to happen in real life is, these really are two very different styles of approaching and discovering insights about reality. Many disagreements in philosophy are due to this pattern\/detail orientation dichotomy, and how we use words themselves displays this. One can tunnel very rigidly on certain semantics, for better or worse. One can also fail to recognize the deep meaning that certain words have. So with respect to both Verbal Disputes articles, a crucial variable seems to be this orientation and how it affects our language use. It means we're basically speaking different languages that aren't very symmetrical-- this may seem to cause the dispute, but it's really deeper. It's our phenomenology, our psychology, and a failure to understand each other on this level that contributes to much confusion.\n\nTwo tangents to close off-- the first is to point out that there's a potential for meta-level confusion here. One can be on the spectrum, be prone to black and white thinking(synonymous with rigidity, an autistic trait-- mathematical, 0 vs. 1, etc, robotic, etc-- these concepts are a part of the cloud of traits we associate with autism), and fail to recognize that this is not a \"Either autistic, **or** schizophrenic\" dichotomy. I believe everyone has this pattern vs. detail orientation to some *degree*. So one can get the wrong answer *due* to being too detail oriented and pattern obtuse(or vice versa) with respect to this very post about the subject. Or this very post could contain errors from bad detail\/pattern orientation. These are just gradations of strategies for forming a picture of reality.\n\nThe second tangent is evolutionary. Some of us have this intuition that \"the better language game\" will win. So, we assume this is \"the one that is more true\". But this isn't true. It's just like saying \"Evolution favors truth\" or \"Evolution favors ethics\"-- evolution doesn't care about truth or ethics, evolution only cares about winning. Dominance. Power. Whatever achieves those things, that's what gets rewarded by evolution, by definition, because you can't beat it, so it beats you. This applies both to the living things on Earth, and also to memetics and our language games and which language games end up dominating. It's the most *adaptive* language game that wins, not the most true, not the most ethical. This is a burden for anyone that existed, exists, or will exist, who cares about concepts of right\/wrong and truth.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630700778,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hbhmsaa","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ph1iv0","locked":false,"name":"t1_hbhmsaa","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_ph1iv0","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/ph1iv0\/verbal_disputes_false_positives_and_fake\/hbhmsaa\/","retrieved_on":1650340065,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I don't for example think, that if someone saw this footage and said, \"Wow, that's just so cruel, what factory farms do to animals-- I think I'm going to be sick. The obvious move from here is simply to never put an animal or animal product into my mouth ever again.\", I wouldn't think something like \"*sigh* ... Yet another confused vegan.\" That's a superficial reading of my views.\n\n If they do this, and this diet causes them health, and wellbeing, and the positive elements of community, and so on-- I would be glad for them. This is purely positive.

Like religion and atheism, the subject of veganism can often be deeply emotional, triggers a lot of anger, disgust, and hostility(sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for bad reasons). \n\nSo it's difficult, and sometimes impossible to discuss sanely or consistently. If someone truly devoutly believes that Jesus Christ *is* the son of God, and that the Bible is literally true, and is already in opposition to anyone who says otherwise, and has a strange absence of Christ-like traits, then the conversation is simply doomed. The same is true for discussions on veganism. Fortunately it's just not that crucial what people eat, and since veganism is predominantly a dietary idea, it's not a huge loss that vegans and ethical non-vegans hash out their differences. What's crucial is that factory farming is effectively shut down as quickly and painlessly as possible, because it is an emergency-- something we tend to forget while we enjoy whatever it is we're eating and feel a sense of reward in our superiority despite more and more animals being force bred and tortured.

This is just reddit, by the way. People who are deeply insecure come here to react to content mindlessly, suffer from black-and-white thinking, and then to pick fights with strangers. This is just what humans *do*, especially deeply insecure ones with low-self awareness.\n\nIronically, you see the fundamental essence of this in the very video this is about-- a meta-level to our conversation here: Human vs. human combativeness, stemming from insecurity, stemming from genetics and environment. Bad intentions cause human suffering. Genetic + an environment around competition for resources, which rewards anti-social strategies, means that bad intentions are proliferated. In real life, and online\/on reddit.\n\nSo onto the video: It's clear this guy isn't stable, right? He's clearly prone to violence in a way that is unhinged. He throws a table at this guard for whatever reason(what could it possibly be? \"Your little boy over there is a &lt;slur&gt;?\" \"You're not allowed in here with a lock to use the locker room?\" What could *possibly* motivate that outburst? Now, what does it say to flip the table that way, and then go: \n\n\"Yup, we're *still* going.\" When you escalate like this, you're already on the sociopathic spectrum. This guy is a meathead, obviously, and the guard lacks the wisdom to see the danger and immediately de-escalate the moment real violence appears, but no doubt he's just looking to defend himself at this point. You're not going to deter Bubba as a geriatric, 145lb guard by menacing him with a table. Knowing this deeply could have saved the guards life, barring the obvious fact that if Bubba wasn't subhuman, that would have done the trick too. \n\nNow, where I think your nuanced view has merit, is in the behavior after the homicide. This is what really separates a psychopath\/sociopath from an average anti-social human being. Notice that, \"Hmmm... I've fucked up\" kind of neurosis? That pacing? Those double, triple, quadruple takes? Yeah, *that*. If it's Ted Bundy here, we'd see a fucking *theatrical performance*. Everything would be calculated, or just total calm walking away with his kid without a care, as if the guy had just been going through the motions and checking their mailbox and walking away.

Eventually that illusion comes crashing down, and the higher up you are, the harder the fall. I agree with you, I think many of the trait-sets we call \"personality disorders\" are closer to super-powers or, maybe more moderately, \"viable strategies\" that evolution produced. Schizoids in particular have this very special gift of dissociation where they basically get a free head start to understanding something that would normally take a lot of luck. It's only through identity association that people suffer from much of the psychosis that evolution produces. This idea that you're you, you're special, you're important, \"the other\" isn't important, you're the main character of this movie-- Schizoids tend to not fall for this fantasy hallucination as hard as others. It's still there, but it's subdued.\n\nIt's easy to see in the people who hurt you as a child, right? That's precisely what I'm describing, right there, operating in their brains. They actually are so self-absorbed in ego that they have lost touch with actual reality. Give them a sufficient dose of LSD or Ketamine or MDMA, and who knows if their current behavior would remain coherent if they're lucky enough to get a taste of ego-loss.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630719544,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hbipe1w","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pgv0l5","locked":false,"name":"t1_hbipe1w","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pgv0l5","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/pgv0l5\/schizoid_in_the_modern_world\/hbipe1w\/","retrieved_on":1650335440,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

And it's a good thing we have this. But I also think the author is just not thinking creatively enough(something this orientation sometimes struggles with) with respect to a sophisticated representation of Laplace's demon. \n\nSo let's reformulate this thought experiment and see what we can discover about reality. Let's say that Laplace's Archdemon is the same except they know not just all facts about physical reality, but all facts about abstract and conceptual reality as well. This contains even infinities of nonsense( as a fact of the conceptualization of nonsense). What would a potential abstract truth claim look like to Laplace's Archdemon? As an example, take the claim:\n\n\n\"Billy is a kind boy\"\n\nIt turns out that the following narrative about the specific boy named Billy(There are many, but we've singled out just one subject), is true: Billy is 8. His favorite hobby is going outside into the garden with his magnifying glass, and slowly roasting various insects he finds, usually ants, alive with the power of his magnifying glass. He takes pleasure in this, knowing that he has control over the insects, who are much weaker than him, and can't stop this behavior. Billy also sometimes plays with the neighbors kittens. They're also quite weak, and struggle to escape him. Because this irritates Billy, he thinks it's only appropriate that he should tie up the kittens who don't suit his behavioral preferences with some twine he found in the shed. \"That'll teach them\", he thinks to himself. At school, Billy has fun learning. But nothing brings Billy more joy than seeing another one of classmates crying after he tells them something cruel. Billy says he doesn't feel bad even a little, because he thinks they deserve it-- Billy is certain he's never wrong.\n\n\nNow, the claim \"Billy is a kind boy\" really does have meaning-- there **is** a fact of the matter here, and its nuance is revealed through an examination of who Billy is, what his motivations are, what his behaviors and actions and thoughts and emotions are, and so on. Billy is in every meaningful sense, **not** a kind boy. Laplace's Archdemon recognizes precisely such facts, with the perfection of the nuance that is contained in the totality of information space that is true, the thing we're most interested in when we use the phrase, \"Objective Reality\". This is why worries about reductionism are often deeply confused. They fail to acknowledge that the same space of \"Human level facts\" is really only distinct via a perspectival illusion from the same space of \"small scale physical mechanics\". They're all simply **one** reality-- the totality of ontology, the realm of facts.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630748011,"distinguished":null,"edited":1630748279.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hbjuse6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_phnkq0","locked":false,"name":"t1_hbjuse6","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_phnkq0","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/phnkq0\/what_is_reductionism_how_laplaces_demon_knows\/hbjuse6\/","retrieved_on":1650330450,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I think this problem exists on a gradient. So the person who makes 11 an hour, benefits from not having the 10 an hour person know. The person who makes 12, benefits from the person below them in wage not know, etc. It chains its way up in a very sinister kind of prisoner's dilemma that obscures the truth of inequality, hierarchy, etc.\n\nHierarchy, by the way, would be totally fine if this was a just world. I don't have the skills to do... I don't know, think of anything and you'll probably guess something I suck at, or you suck at. It will also be true that there will be a master at that thing-- and neither of us will ever reach that level, because we're simply not that person. That's okay-- being different is good. I don't need to be a great painter, and its good that there are people with the talent out there to-- this alone doesn't take away anything from me. But if you only value certain differences that are determined by arbitrary conditions, and then reward those, and structure the world in a way that not only punishes the majority of beings for lacking these valued traits, but also *blames* the victim, then that's not a good world.\n\nThe reason hierarchy and power dynamics are so bad is because this is an **unjust** world. You can't account for the fact that you were born who you are, and not born into poverty, into a Mumbai slum, and lost your arms and legs to a rare disease. Such people exist, and they simply didn't pick that freely any more than you pick or don't pick what you're going to have to eat later, or what gender(s) you're attracted to. You freely pick none of it. So the least lucky people don't *deserve* those conditions. Yet, our society is structured in a way that *punishes* this fact. It also rewards the precise opposite: If you're born into a trust fund, well that's it-- you've practically won the fucking lottery as you take your first real breath of Earth's oxygen. This sort of happenstance exists on a gradient too-- a luck gradient.\n\nWhat kind of system is that? A just world would *account* for this disparity in luck-- yet we see the opposite all over planet Earth. It's not even \"one culture\". It's not the west, the east, the poor countries, the rich countries-- this is literally how humans operate. And not just humans, but animals socialize using this ruthless system too. It's DNA that causes this, because the DNA only cares about one thing: Making more copies of itself. It doesn't care about ethics or knowledge or wisdom, the only criteria is successfully expressing power, and making more copies, for the genes. This process inherently creates hierarchy. \n\nWe know we're not in the worst hell possible. There are *some* social safety nets in our world, but clearly not enough, and not ubiquitous on Earth. People shouldn't have to suffer just due to sheer bad luck, but lucky people(who are actually unlucky, by being given brains incapable of caring about human misery other than their own, oriented to maximize winning superficial games like the stock market) need to signal how rich and powerful they are-- so this project is stagnated.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630750246,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hbjxa0p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pheztb","locked":false,"name":"t1_hbjxa0p","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pheztb","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/pheztb\/deleted_by_user\/hbjxa0p\/","retrieved_on":1650330145,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

One better find their niche in it fast or someone else will gobble it up.\n\nEither way, looking at the card there, the silver lining here is recognizing once more how absolutely incoherent nihilism and anti-realism is. I can't resist some good ol' nihilism, so:\n\n&gt; We are driven by desire, which is a perception of value. Nothing has value in and of itself, it's a perception of it, a desire for it that makes it valuable.\n\n(The implication at the end here, is: \"Therefore, nihilism.\")\n\nThis isn't the direction Inmendham goes though. He then says \"Humans(we assume he means sentient beings) have value\". The problem is, people who subscribe to nihilism or anti-realism use this *precise* line of reasoning, but then say **nothing** can have value, as a matter of fact. To understand how this is wrong, reword this for the trait which everyone values that could only possibly orient us towards reality, and no serious person questions: Logic\n\n&gt; We are driven by logic, which is a perception of value. Nothing has value in and of itself, it's a perception of it, a desire for it that makes it valuable.\n\nWhat does the above mean? How can we clarify it, flesh it out? It means simply that we're *biased* towards logic. We're *oriented* towards logic. We instinctively see 2+2 and recognize it must make 4, not 5. But what do you tell someone who points this out as a *problem* towards making sense of reality? Can someone actually be on firm ground and do this? No, of course not. Why? Because they're using logic, to \"deconstruct\" logic-- it's just a fucking infantile philosophy game that baby philosophers like to play with each other. It's in the same basket as \"Prove to me that you're not just a figment of my imagination\". You can't win that game, because there's no net, there's no bounds to the field, the ball is invisible, the scores are arbitrary, and so on. The other person is simply cheating, and pretending they aren't. That's the *heart* of what makes bad philosophy, bad philosophy.\n\nNow, this same precise game, is played with ethics, but almost no one seems to recognize the problem. \"You're merely *oriented* to be disgusted when you see a dog being skinned alive and tortured with boiling water because in our culture, it \"makes the meat taste better\" \" This isn't *really* unethical, this is just your *bias*\" \"Prove to me that it's *really* wrong\"\n\nAgain, the person who plays *that* game, just isn't being honest, or is deeply confused about what they think good arguments look like. You're being obtuse to the meanings of words. Words like: \"Torture\" \"Suffering\" \"Bad\" \"Cruel\" \"Terror\" \"Worst\" \"Better\" \"Right\" \"Kind\" \"Honest\" \"Dog\" , and so on. These words really do track reality, or not. In the same way the symbols \"2\" \"+\" \"2\" \"=\" \"4\" , really do mean something non-arbitrary, and track reality.\n\nSo while I suspect Gary is a moral realist of some kind, he is really bad at describing what's going on ethically here, and this is largely due to what a cesspool modern moral philosophy is, namely due to \"meta-ethics\"( a term that has caused more confusion than illumination) and entertaining nonsense like moral nihilism\/moral anti-realism\/emotivism, etc.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630787777,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hblymuy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_phtduy","locked":false,"name":"t1_hblymuy","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_phtduy","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/phtduy\/day_one_of_summer_classes_a_random_girl_climbed\/hblymuy\/","retrieved_on":1650320936,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

If you want a functional society that can make real progress, you sort of need to not give everyone who isn't a psychopath anxiety. The \"watch the world burn\" meme is utterly status quo, utterly 13-25 in demographic terms, and deeply benefits the elite(just about as inconvenient of a truth as it gets-- just imagine how **likely** this fact would be absorbed by people who believe the opposite, if all the evidence for it could be presented somehow.

In regimes where the regime doesn't have a strong hold of power over the people, you'll see very draconian laws. You won't be allowed to even criticize the regime, or deviate from the norm. That's how you know the people are actually a threat.\n\nHowever, in the regimes, the superpowers, that do have absurd power, you will see high levels of freedom. Another possibility is power structures that simply are not a threat-- these power structures exist in a different way, because they're like... I dunno, what would be an example in nature of an animal that's just totally uninteresting to other competing animals and exists in their own unique niche?\n\nNothing comes to mind and I'd just prefer to hit \"Save\" on this post, so you'll just have to crudely visualize it yourself. But the analog in our world would be a country like Sweden or something. No one is going to war with Sweden, really. They just don't care. Sweden is not the center of attention. They can afford to purely set up the power dynamic so that everyone who lives there *relatively* happier than a randomly chosen area on Earth. Since they have no real enemies, this is a luxury that is afforded. They have the *privilege* to enjoy mutual good incentives between their power hierarchy, so there's relatively low power struggle and relatively high satisfaction(again, not \"satisfaction\", since you'll find \"unhappy people\" anywhere, but in relation to countries who are doing very badly. We can compare Sweden to Syria, who is torn apart by geopolitical struggles.)\n\nSo, freedom is not a sign of progress, is the point. It's a sign of power. The more free a country is, the less powerful its citizens are insofar as that country is a significant \"player\". To finally answer your question, if you're ludicrously powerful and the people are just pawns for you to manipulate, then it's simply a matter of divide and conquer to maintain your power. This has been employed as a political strategy for thousands of years. You have to fragment the social classes with identity politics, or else the 80% could actually unify and be a real thorn in your side. A part of your power is your ability to *engineer* these divisions, and \"rebelling against them\" *while* the lower classes are fragmented, is one such feature. \n\nYou never win the war against the lion as 1,000 ants. You just fuck the other ants, and adjacent environment. To win the war against the lion you actually first need to unify with **every** lower order in a pro-social way. And by being fractured in terms of identities, ideologies, etc-- this becomes impossible, and the lion laughs straight to the bank everyday and sleeps very well. This is why politics is not the cure, but rather the disease.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630888959,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hbr36sc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_phyyz0","locked":false,"name":"t1_hbr36sc","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_hbocv7b","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/phyyz0\/youre_living_it_bro\/hbr36sc\/","retrieved_on":1650297979,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Something like when we look at 3D illusions on 2d, like the impossible geometries, etc. That).\n\nYou mentioned weed, which is deeply related to dopamine. Marijuana receives a lot of attention from the Parkinsons community and from medical science, and that's because this roughly relates to dopamine as far as I understand. Parkinsons drugs are based around dopamine and dopamine precursors, so the idea is since dopamine is related to sending messages with respect to motor control and coordination, roughly increasing dopamine or dopamine precursors(here's where I'm most at risk of talking out of my ass, because I really don't know the specifics enough-- the role of dopaminergic systems is roughly significant though-- that much I think is true), then motor control and coordination improve in Parkinsons patients whose symptoms are caused by issues in that area.\n\nNow what else does dopamine do? It actually is deeply related to pattern recognition. This is why if you're high on weed, you see patterns everywhere. Everything profound. It's mostly THC that does this but I'm sure there are other cannabinoids that play some supporting role. So what would you guess, if I asked you, was a side effect of taking Parkinsons drugs?\n\nYep, psychosis. Patterns that aren't there. Hallucinations. Paranoia. etc. Same as with weed. And since deja vu is centered around the recognition of a pattern, dopamine(determines perceptual significance of pattern) + memory(recognition of pattern) are the key players in deja vu.

There are billions of people on this planet, and obviously our preferences are going to conflict. What I reject is proposing that the solution to this complexity is to accept such conflicts. It is literally impossible for everyone to get what they desire, so our response to this should be to find a way to at least put the relative strengths of those desires (or, more to the point, strengths of experiences that come with them) on a comparable scale. If we refuse to do this, the alternative is aimless at best, negligent at worst.\n\nIt's really going to be tough to add something, but I will try to add that disagreement about values implies that there's something to disagree *about*. There's a fact of the matter. Just imagine two people are arguing about Covid vaccines being a good idea, or a bad idea. And one says they work, the other says they don't, and you arrive and say, \"Hey, do you think there's a *fact* of the matter about whether or not we should value these vaccines?\" And they just look puzzled and say, \"Nope! :)\" It just becomes bewildering what these people are even *doing*... it's just incoherent. Right?\n\nI think I'm very close ethically to this person, because I agree with almost everything they've written. ~~The area I think I disagree is resting ethics on dopamine(Which I think this author is doing as per the title, and) as per lines like:~~ (Late edit: It's pretty clear the author is against basing ethics on dopamine, but rather ethics must be coherent somehow with more meaningful conceptions of right and wrong, and not merely being a natural kind of \"zonking out on endogenous feel-good stuff\". I knew this at the time of writing but just failed to catch this and edit it)\n\n&gt;  It is literally impossible for everyone to get what they desire, so our response to this should be to find a way to at least put the relative strengths of those desires (or, more to the point, strengths of experiences that come with them) on a comparable scale.\n\nThis comes close to nailing it for me so I can only try to improve upon it. Clearly what's right and wrong has *something* to do with desires. But are desires alone being advocated here? Like a kind hedonism? Because to me, it needs to be contextualized for it to make ethical sense. This is why I don't like negative utilitarianism as a *perfect* ethical description despite it coming the closest to my ethics(probably the only trivial point of disagreement I'd have with this author). If the world were 75% psychopaths, and they suffered deeply because there just weren't enough victims, then it's still *possible* to come to the wrong conclusions using only NU as a guideline, or *only* dopamine, or *only* one's preferences. We can be *wrong* about what we prefer, is the crucial thing we have to admit. The author does seem to have recognized this problem(Late edit: Yeah, here you can see I'm not confused about the other in the original submission of the post).\n\nWhat we prefer is a happenstance of our biochemistry and psychology. What is ethical is independent of this in the same way that mathematical truths are. 2+2 still equals 4 in a universe of rocks, there's just no one around to appreciate the fact. And if beings evolved who thought 2+2 equaled 5 there, that wouldn't change the fact of 2+2 resulting in 4. That just says the beings in that universe just don't have the fortune to intuit logic-- the pathway for things to make sense(or not make sense).\n\nI think this is analogous to where we are with ethics. While we as humans are largely fortunate in being able to intuit logic, academics in particular and people interested in ethical philosophy tend to fail to recognize the same problem *must* occur with ethics, and they do this by shrouding the fact that ethics is a purely descriptive enterprise like math, and then argue against the values that make the idea coherent by questioning the only value that would *make* it coherent in the first place. This tricks quite a lot of people. Here's how this works in math, first:\n\n\"There are facts about math. 2+2=4. But this is purely descriptive. We don't need people to convince us to *do* math, we just *do* math.\"\n\nthen:\n\n\"There are facts about ethics. If a powerful group of people enslaved you right now and tortured you until you died simply because they *could*, for their own entertainment, and went on to live unpunished, this would be a profound injustice.\"\n\nPurely descriptive.\n\nBut the second claim, people think really needs some kind of prescription or it's purely meaningless and can't be applied to reality, while the same burden doesn't seem to exist with math despite being ontologically identical. One doesn't go \"10 - 2 may = 8, but that's only descriptive-- you can't tell someone that they *ought* to give a person at the store 8 dollars back at the store if the item they purchased cost 2, and they paid with 10.\" One just *does* it, and to speak this way about math would be pretty insane. This is identical to how insane we are about admitting ethical facts.\n\nSo it seems we'd rather keep ethics ambiguous or deny their existence philosophically or try to rig ethics up using very strange foundations(black-or-white rules, utility, suffering, preference). What is it about ethics? Who and\/or what does ethics pose a problem for, where math poses no problem for, in our world? This is the crucial question to ask to discover what is actually going on.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630954200,"distinguished":null,"edited":1631414009.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hbu8cma","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pibmyf","locked":false,"name":"t1_hbu8cma","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pibmyf","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/pibmyf\/dopamine_morals_a_critique_of_value_pluralism\/hbu8cma\/","retrieved_on":1650285319,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Sexual dynamics are just not designed to make everyone perfectly happy. Let's start admitting that. The second thing we should admit is we should not place the blame on any gender. One didn't pick their gender, and the way their gender is, no matter *which* gender you look at-- so one could just arbitrarily point to either and place all the blame(\"Why can't *you* conform to *my* needs?\"&lt;-- this would be totally narcissistic, right?), or you can recognize the way a gender is, is not \"freely chosen\" by someone.\n\nThe fact of the matter is, that men are *generally*(outliers clearly exist) burdened by a very active libido in a way that women aren't for obvious reasons. This not only makes women suffer, but it makes men suffer as well-- when you cause someone suffering, you will inevitably suffer as well. Everyone loses here. You're in a uniquely difficult spot because you can see this potentially manipulative game of push-and-pull(a significant BPD dynamic) right before you. \n\nHe wants to feel good with the person he feels strongly about, but he also doesn't seem to want to put you into a position where you're just sacrificing your interests all the time. You genuinely want him to feel good, but you're worried about being valued as a person rather than an object with a narrow purpose. Just notice how this dynamic seems to *force* both parties to be miserable. If someone wins, someone else seems to lose. So both people \"play the game\" in a way that usually ends up with *both* parties losing.\n\nAgain, it's not your fault. We should really stress that. You're clearly torn between two bad choices. But this is also true for your partner. That's why I think the most important thing you could *both* realize, is simply how you're both in the same boat. This narrows the empathy gap you both have between each other. It would be very hard for us to hurt each other if we much more deeply felt the frustrations and worries the other person feels-- but it's actually sometimes easy for us to hurt each other because we just don't have perfect access to this. From there, just ask what would happen if you both totally genuinely told one another: \"I'm here for you\".

From the salvia-inspired art above, you see a depiction of the body unzipping, ripping apart, then being diced into small pieces, while the head is squashed and spread out into pasta. If it isn’t clear already, most people don’t actually enjoy salvia all that much. But for some, this drug offers an entirely novel mindscape of dysdelia that seems to be a previously unexplored front of the chemical mind.\n\nSalvia was the first strongly mind-altering drug I had tried. I think I was 18 or 19 then? It was an extract, and a lot of it. Likely an \"insane amount\". I just recall inhaling the smoke, holding it in, exhaling, and losing consciousness shortly after. From there, it was like being under anesthesia. \n\nNo trip whatsoever from what I remember, then very, very slowly coming to. It was the slowest \"wake up\" process of my life, I didn't know where I was at first. All I felt was a very ambiguous physical motion repeating along with a sound: dun-dun. Dun-dun. Dun-dun. Dun-dun. Slowly direction came back. And then the form of my body. What was happening was I was rocking in a semi-fetal position, gripping my knees, sitting down on a couch, in total confusion, with no recollection of the last few minutes.\n\nWithin seconds of waking up the fact that I was speaking the whole time became coherent with the above: \"Oh my god... Oh my god... Oh my god... Oh my god... Oh my god\" (only words I said, and they were just automatic and uncontrolled).\n\nI slowly got a grip of where I was, the room, the fact that I smoked this substance, etc. After some time when the people joining me made sure I was back to Earth, they told me that I actually spoke something out loud after I had lost consciousness, which I had no recollection of at all of course. And this supposedly was: \"I see the force... ...and it is dark.\" This tells me I had an experience, it was likely deeply traumatic, and\/or the amnesiac effects were so powerful that the trip was lost forever, for better or for worse.\n\nGreat read though. I wish I knew more about the neurochemistry or had a recent experience with the thing in question, so I could take a fresh look at what's going on, because I'm a little curious, just not enough to engage in anything that could result in a 'trip' at this point in life.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631087843,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hc19pfn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_phqtaq","locked":false,"name":"t1_hc19pfn","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_phqtaq","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/phqtaq\/dysdelia_proposing_a_new_hallucinogenic_class_and\/hc19pfn\/","retrieved_on":1650261976,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

A lot of the explanations in this thread are either a bit too zoomed in or complicated or both. They're not wrong, but some seem very narrow and don't capture the simple fact of what actually *determines* how a person is, how they behave. And that thing is: traits.\n\nSo, what traits could possibly determine how one performs under pressure? OCEAN's really popular(even though it's narrow and doesn't really give a very meaningful account of personality in my opinion). So we already know what sticks out here for what we're interested in, right? Neuroticism seems to be the \"choke\" trait. The subjectivity of \"choking\" is deeply neurotic, yes, but this doesn't tell us about the person over all. They could be mostly low in neuroticism, but their neuroticism may surface in times of pressure or stress. This isn't the most meaningful for us. How do we look broader-- simpler?\n\nWhat does it *mean* to not feel stress when a train is going at you at 100mph and your foot is trapped in the rail? It means a state of fearlessness. It means a kind of ignorance of the severity of the situation with respect to what can go wrong. So now we've really distilled what's going on: People with fearlessness and low risk-aversion will by definition perform very well under pressure, because these things are deeply linked to the scenario: It presupposes that there's something to fear, or some risk, etc.\n\nThis still doesn't tell us how you(OP) personally do poorly in high stakes situations. But it does tell us what can't be true about you: You don't have the fearlessness or low-risk aversion of what we'd informally call a psychopath, that much is safe to assume. From here it gets harder, since we've only identified what most likely causes the absence of choking. Now we're interested in what causes the *presence* of choking, something much harder to identify, because it could be a host of things. Some kind of insecurity? Worry of judgement? Worry of failure? Self-sabotage? Some kind of conditioning from childhood? Intrusive thoughts? The list goes on. But notice that all of these things are incoherent in the presence of true fearlessness and true low risk-aversion. Indeed, these traits simply turn **off** choking. I'm sure how these traits can manifest are varied by the way, but the end result of their manifestation really is a requirement to not choke.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631091655,"distinguished":null,"edited":1631105651.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hc1dt8a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pjgqth","locked":false,"name":"t1_hc1dt8a","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pjgqth","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/pjgqth\/why_some_people_choke_under_pressure\/hc1dt8a\/","retrieved_on":1650261576,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Even if you're dwelling on the past or anticipating in the future, it's all on the cutting edge of precisely right now in a way that is truly inescapable. If you want, you can utter the word \"now\" over and over to yourself like a lunatic(like I just did, to really sink this in.

Ontological substrate-&gt;phenomenological cloud. That's a fine representation, and it seems factual. But it may not be either or-- that's the part that never made sense to me.

Reality being bad. If reality is bad, then we'd expect evolution to not reward being in touch with it. Someone who falsely believes it is good, will instead get rewarded. Someone who is \"sane\" and recognizes it is bad, will get punished by evolution simply because recognizing this fact is psychologically destabilizing-- it hurts survival. \n\nForcefully medicating the depressed is therefore a kind of forced group psychosis engineering. You're making the sane, insane, in order to improve survival. We expect something in the universe to guarantee \"equally opposing forces\". A yin needs a yang. Up needs down.

I don't think someone should be preoccupied by this. I don't think anyone should value social positions, because they're arbitrary, and arise from unconscious evolutionary processes, in a way where higher values don't exactly match up.\n\nSo for example, we can value something like meaningful skill, or intelligence, or truth, or goodness\/ethics\/kindness-- and while those still arise from evolution, they are values that can be re-assessed by a conscious agent to be specifically recognized as desirable(not as opinion but as a matter of fact in a context of conscious things looking to maneuver through reality-- it's objectively true we should discover the knowledge to navigate the word in a way that avoids torturing each other maximally). Social niches aren't this way-- they're just like... \"Worker ant\" or \"Queen bee\" -- they're totally arbitrary like these \"roles\". They're mindless, and they don't *say* anything good about the thing with them in the precise same way we could say being a kind person or being a deeply skilled person who enriches the world says something meaningful.\n\nThere was a great video I saw the other night so I want to share it:\n\n[Don't plan](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ESxCgFHX35o&amp;feature=youtu.be).\n\nWhen you say you lack motivation, and you procrastinate, you're actually just expressing the traumatized symptoms of a world structured around \"Worker ant\" systems, or \"Queen Bee\" systems.

Question what a disorder means. Be curious. Be honest. Don't just fall back into what you've been taught all of your life. Get into the nitty gritty with a microscope and magnifying glass and *really* ask-- \"Is this thing I've believed is good\/bad all of my life *really* good or bad?

If today at this time I believe it matters that we punch old people I can believe it matters and it can not actually objectively matter, here, today, right now. It's not about new information later on, it's that our views can be subjective and valuable to us but not actually matter objectively\n\nI think your explanation was fine and none of that actually clarifies what I see as the problem here.  The problem is a misunderstanding of what \"Subjective mattering\" and \"Objective mattering\" is. They're actually the same thing in the sense that is crucial to the ontology here.\n\nIt's clear to me the semantics of \"matter\" are not working the same way. \"Actually matters\" does not mean \"objectively matters in some sort of absolute dogmatic sense\". It simply means as a representation of what is true about reality, insofar as such representations are possible for conscious beings who are helplessly stuck in a tunnel of their own reality models. We can't get beyond that problem with **any** fact about the world, but we don't apply this kind of skepticism to math. We say 2+2=4, and we don't mean \"Sort of kind of I could be wrong it could really be 5\", that thought doesn't really cross our minds-- we assume we're not insane with respect to logic being a functional model of what making sense means. And if it *did* equal 5? Then **that** would be true, too. Chomsky in the video you sent me did a great job of making this point with Nihilism when he said \"People will argue for nihilism, but no one is actually a nihilist.\"(Paraphrasing) It's just a game with words that sophists like to play. Just notice what this implies:\n\n&gt; To be super simplistic about it: I'm wrong semi-regularly so I would never claim my judgement is highly reliable\n\nThis implies you **are** wrong in these cases, it's *possible* be wrong. Not just in some trivial way that only exists in you, but as an actual true description of reality. It means you can be *actually* wrong-- not just subjectively wrong. There's a fact about what you're wrong **about**. Refer to Wednesday or Tuesday, and notice how insane it would be to apply some kind of hyper-skepticism or deconstruction to this to wiggle one's way out of admitting \"It is true that today is not Tuesday.\"\n\n&gt; Also \"If it matters to you, that alone means it actually matters outside of your view\" is hypothetically nonsense if the thing doesn't objectively matter or subjectively matter to anyone else than it literally doesn't matter outside of one person's view.\n\nI think you're confusing a subjective fact-based statement as being *strictly* subjective. Everything that occurs in a subject is also a part of objectivity. If I say \"I'm the only conscious being in the universe because that's the only thing I can know for certain\", then this is a claim about reality that comes from a subject: me. In this sense, we say it's \"Subjective\", but we mean a variety of things by this. We can mean: \"Comes from a subject\" or we can mean \"Totally empty of factuality due to being embedded in a subject\". It's this second part that is mind-destroying(very well subscribed) philosophical garbage. People associate subjective statements with statements like, \"Chocolate is the best kind of cake.\" Which we think is totally subjective and meaningless of objective fact, but then we apply these kind of semantics to simple claims coming from subjects, such as \"The Earth revolves around the Sun\".

It sounds depressing to you now, but this is actually wonderful. It shows something that very few people, even those who are not BPD, have: Self-awareness. To realize that you've harmed others is a *blessing*. Notice here that you're *not* thrilled about this. You don't *want* to be a bad person(I would argue that not even the worst people on earth *truly* want to be a bad person-- they're just too confused to understand).

Nazism is explicitly fascist, where as where Communism behaves badly, it does so as a function of people being irredeemably broken.\n\nThe more interesting question is in the consequentialism here:\n\n&gt; “You have to break a few eggs to make an omelette” \n\nand here:\n\n&gt; Now I’m not one for utopia-building or defending the argument of “the end justifies the means”. However, I think because this argument that the ends justifies the means is still socially acceptable, the hammer and sickle is still socially acceptable.\n\n&gt; Not that it should be socially acceptable. Is “the ends justifies the means” an inherently evil argument?\n\nSo the question is, are the *consequences* the only thing that matters? The answer is no, but the consequences still matter deeply. If you can get the right consequences, then really almost anything goes. You can expose just how *clearly* consequences matter by inventing a thought experiment which isn't hard, like most ethical thought experiments are hard, ie, the trolley problem. But rather, invent a thought experiment that presents to you a truly despicable action in the small, day-to-day scale, that comes with it the most cosmic and benevolent consequences imaginable. If ends justify the means *at all*, then this will demonstrate it. If even *here* we fail to show the consequences being worth it, then ends simply do not justify the means. Here goes:\n\nInject *anything* your imagination comes up with. Torture, sexual violence, murder, etc as the requisite act-- something that only a true monster would do, and then just rig the stakes *so* highly that you'd now need to be a monster to *not* do the act. What would this look like? Just pretend that we guarantee that nothing [suffers injustice](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo) ever again, for the totality of reality. This includes [both humans](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/) and [animals](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FMepy_THcOg?t=13). And not only that, but now every being that exists experiences perpetually increasing states of genuine meaning and sublime bliss. And all you need to do is murder some poor bastard or commit some other awful act a single time. In this *specific* context, this act is purely heroic. Only being brain-dead after huffing the glue of something like deontology could someone fail to get the right answer here. All we need to know, to know the ends justify the means, is to admit that such a move would be the single most ethical thing anyone could possibly do. You *guarantee* things don't descend into hell by doing this. You truly commit just one final injustice, among which where will be endless more injustices like it, worse than it, if you don't act.\n\nNow, does this tell us *anything* else? No, of course not-- it doesn't tell us we should tunnel on consequences to such a degree that we begin sacrificing everyone's interests right now, since right now clearly doesn't matter. Only psychopaths have done this historically, and it's from *this* broader consequentialist attitude that we get the atrocities that give everyone a bad taste in their mouths when they're asked, \"Do the ends justify the means?\" That's rightfully insane. This is why consequentialism isn't exactly a perfectly optimized ethical thought system even though it's *technically* correct, if you just add the caveat to the consequences being ethically urgent enough. But if you tunnel rigidly on consequences(sort of like a deontologist) you can really just ignore *any* cost to those consequences-- this is the pathology of consequentialism. Clearly some costs are too great for certain consequences, and this is how we know consequentialism is not the most accurate way of seeing ethics.\n\nThe antidote to this is simply admitting what actually matters in reality: The way in which beings experience it, in meaningful rather than superficial terms. So a school of ethics that properly accounts for that(or a political model) will lead to ethical outcomes more so than something that places the salience of ethics\/progress on something much more vague and detached from what actually matters, like consequences, or utility, or rules, or some other bullshit that doesn't actually guarantee preventing a 900 trillion year maximized hell from emerging. If you admit that the quality of experience in the most meaningful way is all that matters, indeed, all that **could** matter(quite literally every other interpretation of mattering is just incoherent)-- then you come the closest to guarantee a) ending hell and b) preventing hell.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631174522,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hc5pvj6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pkgsp2","locked":false,"name":"t1_hc5pvj6","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pkgsp2","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/pkgsp2\/on_why_the_hammer_and_sickle_is_not_treated_the\/hc5pvj6\/","retrieved_on":1650248095,"score":0,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Practically a flawless take on the problem of our world. He admits the *ethics* of this situation first of all rather than pretending like nothing can be good or bad. He recognizes the bullshit of being forced into class structures and enslaved with meager pay(the norm for a very long time now), \"or else\". And it's done without some kind of resentment, even though I'm sure this person felt it before as everyone has. He's exhausted to the brink of honesty.\n\nThere are really just two things I think he gets wrong here, which is incredible for someone this young I think:\n\n1) \" *Anything* is better than this \"\n\nThat is simply not true. There are quite a lot of ways to get things wrong, and not a lot of ways to get things right. That's just where we are. Way to move closer to hell number 239: Elect more people like Trump. Way 904: Become so morally confused and unable to make sense of right and wrong, and be so bigoted that we not just exist as citizens in the sort of states that committed mass murder in the 20th century, but we actually *support* these states without realizing it, thinking we are somehow \"part of the revolution\" in doing so. That's the level of propaganda and manipulation that goes on in our world and has been a part of ever dictatorship. That's the care that was *not* taken in 1930's Germany and similar cases, and I currently see zero evidence of it not happening again with ease. It's not even a one-party problem.\n\n2) \"I think money is just the most evil and most toxic creation ever\"\n\nThis is an old idea, \"money is the root of all evil\", but we can test this idea with a thought experiment. If it's really money, the money will poison people who are deeply good human beings. And if it's not money, then taking money away will dramatically transform the damage people like the elites who run our world do. So let's plug in the most benevolent human being who has ever walked the Earth, and clone them, and just present an economy and press \"play\". Then, take the most evil sadistic fascist human beings who have walked the Earth, and give them no money, and a society to terrorize, and press \"play\". What do these two scenarios look like? What does this tell us about what the *core* problem is in our world?\n\nBut yeah, a rare gem from Tiktok because while there are plenty of heartfelt things said on there, they're often a bit too rehearsed you can tell, despite still being spot on and true(and often to a benefit, because they're well performed or entertaining due to rehearsal).

We get these bad incentives from the way evolution plays out. Let's just do a recap, of where we are, scientifically, okay?\n\nWe're on a rock. In space. \n\nAt first, there was no life here. Then, life. Then, complex organisms. Now the game is, these organisms need energy. To get energy, they need to compete because it's limited-- space, resources, mates-- all limited. So the things which win this little \"competition\", get rewarded.\n\nFrom here, we get some evil strategies, like eating things alive. Slowly, with time, consciousness evolves. Now things can truly feel pain. The lights are on, and the nervous systems get more complicated. Now the strategies get even more evil. Always being selected. And remember, they don't go away. They're encoded in the next set of survivors. Which continually makes things worse. And worse. And worse.\n\nEventually, our ancestors arrive, and now us. What kinds of strategies apply for us? Well, like you mention with your father-- if this world truly is a hellish place, then beings here like ourselves will be incentivized to *abuse* rather than to nurture our offspring. Evolution is looking for *just* the bare minimum of nurture, and *just* the maximum of abuse before breaking the genetic carrier. If the genetic carrier breaks, that's no good to the genes. If the genetic carrier isn't abused, that's also not good to the genes, contrary to what most people would expect.\n\nThis is because no abuse means, a highly sensitive child. Rich emotion. Rich sensation. The strategy nature has come up with is to completely dull the child and show them such neglect that it turns this child either into a depressive who won't interfere, or a sociopath who will go on to mirror this strategy and be adapted to abuse, which is plentiful in the real world.\n\nSo you see, in an ideal world, parents would love to purely love their children. But in a hellish world, they are *forced* into this move, which they are not even conscious of. They don't think about it, or they invent some fancy narrative, these are all tricks the genes came up with to make the strategy \"work\". But by \"working\", which means winning, it actually loses, paradoxically. To win in this world, *is* to lose. But to lose is *also* to lose. This is a feature of a hellish world-- a world where there are no real winning moves, moves which redeem things. That's not our world. This works on a macro scale too. Just consider nuclear weapons. With nuclear weapons, it's clear that **everyone** loses, if they exist. A world without any nuclear weapons benefits everyone. Yet, if you were in charge of a superpower, and there was an enemy superpower, and you both were aware Nukes were possible, what could you *possibly* do here? You could simply do the \"Right\" thing, and not build them. But then you *know* the enemy will build them-- and either use them on you, or posture in a way that causes you to be slowly crushed by the power disparity.\n\nBoth sides understand this problem. So despite it being best for everyone, if everyone cooperates here and refuses to build the nukes, what ends up happening is, both parties end up picking the wrong move because they know that the other side will not be so kind. Again, this is a direct result of the evolutionary substrate-- it **forces** you to cheat, because cheating is programmed into the genes, and then the genes make better and better cheaters. No referee. This problem exists between parent and child, between friend and friend, partner and partner, nation and nation, etc. A lot of people aren't actually demons, they're just otherwise relatively good people who were destroyed by the sinister game being played in this place.\n\nLuckily, this is not a total hell. What that means is, there are *gradations* of losing. So for example, one could simply not do much *Or*...\n\nOne could go outside and begin to ruin peoples lives for some frivolous or poorly intentioned reason. Those are two real choices to make. And while it's purely determined by what kind of person one is, it's still true to say that one choice is objectively worse, and objectively makes the world more hellish. Likewise, there are choices which make the world *less* hellish. This is a genuine silver lining.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631210926,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hc7jlk1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pjdzdn","locked":false,"name":"t1_hc7jlk1","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_pjdzdn","permalink":"\/r\/areweinhell\/comments\/pjdzdn\/what_if_everyone_youve_ever_known_or_seen_are\/hc7jlk1\/","retrieved_on":1650242630,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"areweinhell","subreddit_id":"t5_yzbmg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/areweinhell","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

So in Buddhist terms, it would be said that one is craving or desiring something. There's some degree of paradox here unfortunately, because it's incoherent to sit down and meditate with no purpose at all. One desires something. Training attention, seeking enlightenment(whatever that is), etc.\n\nBut the crucial difference is to realize that enlightenment isn't actually a massaging one's defense mechanisms away. This happens naturally, if it does. The only \"goal\" if there were goals, would be simply to cultivate awareness. Not run from the pain\/trauma\/emotion\/thought-- but to strictly **notice** non-judgmentally. Notice what happens to the pain when observing it with no kind of attachment or aversion. It is a letting go, not a pushing away, or massaging away. If it stays, that's okay. If it goes, that's okay. That's the attitude that's expressed in the philosophy, if you're interested in trying.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631211396,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hc7kqns","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pk61ns","locked":false,"name":"t1_hc7kqns","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_hc7flds","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/pk61ns\/deleted_by_user\/hc7kqns\/","retrieved_on":1650242535,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

We generally want to be our best selves when we respond to things in life, and at the very least the most important things. When umm, there's a lot of trauma early, sometimes people don't get conditioned into this kind of luxury and they're forced to make decisions like they're in a war zone where hesitation means death. Sounds familiar?\n\nSo I think recognizing that whatever happened early on contributed somehow to this problem is a good starting point. But notice you're already there, so just also recognize how *good* that is. You actually are the person who can say \"I am impulsive and this *worries* me\". You're *not* the person who can't even realize, and is just walking into an invisible wall over and over never knowing why. That's a huge first step.\n\nThe second step is just more awareness of impulsivity. You may have heard the word \"mindfulness\", which if you think about it, in the context of impulsivity, seems like opposites, no? How can one be both mindful *and* impulsive? Just think about this: \"I was deeply mindful but I made a rash decision.\" Just a nonsense statement, right? Now compare: \"I was mindless and I made a rash decision\". Now we're talking-- we've actually captured what's going on in the head, by making the pattern more clear.\n\nSo the good news is that mindfulness can be trained, like a muscle. Works the same way as strength: Recognize that if you committed today to pick up a heavy object with a certain muscle, put it back down, and just repeat this enough, you **will** get stronger. Just as a matter of fact, causally: A leads to B leads to C. Sitting down, closing ones eyes, and just paying attention to the natural breath going in and out in a way that isn't judgemental causes attention to and clarity to improve. The same exact way that lifting a heavy enough weight enough times for long enough, causes strength to improve.\n\nSo it could be scary to recognize how our minds are sometimes and then worry about the future, if we'll make some colossal mistake and not be aware at the moment of the mistake, but there's actually a very clear process to prevent this, and that's simply training awareness. Recognize that neither you nor anyone deserves to suffer this way. Consider reading that sentence over a *second* time if you want a tiny taste of what mindfulness is like. Notice how the sentence seems even more clear when we really pay attention to it?\n\n\"Recognize that neither you nor anyone deserves to suffer this way.\"\n\nTry slowing the sentence down, like you're really trying to chew a bite of food diligently. That clarity after really recognizing, that's mindfulness. And that's the thing you want in the moment *right* before an impulsive move.

That said, the way in which life can be bad for boys(and even men) has been swept under the rug for a long time now. This says nothing about all the ways in women are discriminated against, which they clearly have been\/are, despite tons of progress in that area and more to go. So while women's issues seem thoroughly exposed, men's issues simply have received almost no attention. Part of this is due to the denial that such a thing even can exist because of gender norms-- part of discrimination itself. If you have a deeper interest in this subject, I highly recommend \"The Second Sexism\" by David Benatar. An excerpt to whet your appetite:\n\n&gt; Perhaps the most obvious example of male disadvantage is the long history of social and legal pressures on men, but not on women, to enter the military and to fight in war, thereby risking their lives and bodily and psychological health. Where the pressure to join the military has taken the form of conscription, the costs of avoidance have been self-imposed exile, imprisonment, physical assault or, in the most extreme circumstances, execution. Millions of men have been conscripted and forced into battle. Others have been press-ganged into naval service. While conscription has been abolished in an increasing number of countries – at least for now – it is still employed, in one form or another, in over 80 countries. These include many developed liberal democracies, where the legal barriers to the advancement of women have (almost) all been broken down.\n\n&gt; In those times and places where the pressures on men to join the military have been social rather than legal, the costs of not enlisting have been either shame or ostracism. It may be hard for people in contemporary western societies to understand how powerful those forces have been in other contexts. However, young men, and even boys, have felt, and been made to feel, that their manhood is impugned if they fail to enlist. In other words, they would be cowards if they failed to respond to the call to arms. Women, oblivious to their own privilege in being exempt from such pressures and expectations, have sometimes taken a lead in shaming men who they thought should already have volunteered.\n\n&gt; One particularly graphic example of this is the campaign, during the First World War, of British women distributing white feathers – a symbol of cowardice – to young men who were not in uniform. These were distributed even to adolescent boys who were technically too young to register. One boy, Frederick Broome, who had succeeded in enlisting at age 15, fought in battle, was returned to England in a febrile state and then discharged at the insistence of his father, who produced his birth certificate to convince the authorities. Then, while walking over a bridge in town, then age 16, young Frederick was accosted by four girls who gave him three white feathers. He later recalled as follows:\n\n&gt; I felt very humiliated. I finished the walk over the bridge and there on the other side was the Thirty-seventh London Territorial Association of the Royal Field Artillery. I walked straight in and rejoined the army.\n\n&gt; Even in those few societies where women have been conscripted, they have almost invariably been treated more leniently. Thus, Israel, one of the few contemporary states (and perhaps the only liberal democratic state) currently to conscript women, is far less demanding of women than it is of men. Women are conscripted for under two years and men for a full three years. While men serve in the reserves until age 54, women serve only until age 24. Moreover, married women but not married men are exempt. Women are also much more likely to be exempt on other grounds (such as religious commitments). Most important of all, women are not forced into combat and are thereby spared the worst of military life. Indeed, they are largely placed in jobs that “free up” more men for combat.\n\n&gt; Some have noted, quite correctly, that the definition of “combat” often changes, with the result that although women are often formally kept from combat conditions, they are sometimes effectively engaged in risky combat activity. This is most pronounced in the case of the United States military where, de facto even though not de jure, women are increasingly in conditions where they come under enemy fire. [...T]he difference between being “in harm’s way” and “in combat” (in the narrow sense) is the difference between hoping but failing to avoid contact with the enemy and seeking out such contact and engaging with the enemy. Moreover, it remains true that in those relatively few situations, both historically and geographically, in which women are permitted to take roles that expose them to greater risk, it is a result of their choice rather than coercion. Even then women are usually kept, insofar as possible, from the worst combat situations. [...]\n\n&gt; Nor should we forget just how terrible combat is. The conditions can be appalling. Consider, for example, the conditions faced by the English troops awaiting the battle of Agincourt on October 25, 1415:\n\n&gt; Waiting … must have been a cold, miserable and squalid business. It had been raining, the ground was recently ploughed, air temperature was probably in the forties or low fifties Fahrenheit and many in the army were suffering from diarrhoea. Since none would presumably have been allowed to leave the ranks while the army was deployed for action, sufferers would have had to relieve themselves where they stood. For any afflicted man-at-arms wearing mail leggings laced to his plate armour, even that may not have been possible. Nor is diarrhea a necessary condition for these excremental indignities: As contact with the enemy draws nearer, anticipation sharpens into fear. Its physical effects are striking. The heart beats rapidly, the face shines with sweat and the mouth grows dry – so dry that men often emerge from battle with blackened mouths and chapped lips. The jaws gape or the teeth chatter, and in an effort to control himself a man may clench his jaw so tightly that it will ache for days afterwards. Many lose control of their bladder or bowels. Nearly a quarter of the soldiers of an American division interviewed in the South Pacific admitted that they had fouled themselves, and the spectacle of soldiers urgently urinating just before they go into action is as old as battle itself. \n\n&gt; Once battle begins so do the casualties. Millions of men have been killed in combat. They have been clubbed with various instruments, decapitated with swords and cannonballs, hacked with axes, penetrated in every part of the body – the head, chest, abdomen, genitals and limbs – by arrows, bullets and shrapnel – and blown to smithereens. They have been poisoned with gas, burned alive, crashed to their deaths in aircraft, drowned and hemorrhaged internally from the pressure of blasts. Some die instantly. Others have bled to death, succumbed to infections or otherwise perished from their wounds over periods of varying duration. Some mortally wounded have died slowly on the battlefield because timely evacuation for medical treatment was impossible.\n\n&gt; Not all casualties are fatal. Some are relatively mild, but nonetheless a disadvantage relative to women, who were spared such injuries by being exempt from combat. Serious injuries, however, are extremely common. Men have lost limbs, jaws, noses, ears and eyes. They have been blinded, deafened, paralyzed and disfigured in innumerable ways. Nor are all the wounds physical. The trauma of combat, being injured, witnessing the gruesome deaths and wounds of comrades, and even inflicting such on enemies, can readily cause psychological trauma. Soldiers can be haunted for decades by their combat experiences, impacting negatively on their lives in myriad ways.\n\n&gt; The horrors of war are such that many soldiers – even those who volunteered, but more especially conscripts – would much rather leave battle than stay. The pressures against desertion are partially social. Men, if they are to save face, must act bravely and “honorably.” But these pressures are insufficient to keep all men in rank, and thus steep penalties have been imposed for those who seek to hold back or run away. Deserters are regularly imprisoned but other penalties have included branding. Deserters have often been executed, either summarily on the spot or following a court martial. Among those who were executed for desertion are those who would today, at least in some societies, be recognized as having post-traumatic stress disorder. However, there are still cases, even in enlightened societies, where the military is insufficiently attentive to the psychological stresses of combat. In 2003 an American soldier, on his second night in Iraq, saw an Iraqi who had been cut in half by machine-gun fire. The soldier vomited and “shook for hours. His head pounded and his chest hurt.” “When he informed his superior that he was having a panic attack and needed to see someone,” he said he “was given two sleeping pills and told to go away.” Two days later he was shipped back to the United States and then charged with cowardice. “Coward is a pretty big stigma to carry around,” he said. Eventually all charges against him were dropped, but not before causing him a great deal of distress.\n\n&gt; Other soldiers, wishing to avoid both continued combat or the punishments for deserting, have feigned psychiatric illness, while others have resorted to self-mutilation, rendering themselves unfit for continued service. Some are so desperate that they take their own lives.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631264597,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hcah9he","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pl5yi5","locked":false,"name":"t1_hcah9he","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pl5yi5","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/pl5yi5\/is_it_now_objectively_worse_to_be_male_shocking\/hcah9he\/","retrieved_on":1650233853,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Just remember, if it ever seems difficult to let go of the judgement in the future, you did not make yourself. To be blameworthy in a real sense, you had to have made yourself and been the cause of the way in which you are. Yet you didn't choose a *single* thing that makes you, you, in any ultimate sense. You didn't pick your genes or environment or socioeconomic status or geography or parents or peergroups or brain\/neurology or luck or the chemicals you interacted with that affected you somehow-- yet these are the things that determine every thought you've ever had, and every decision you've ever made. \n\nDoes this mean it's not still important to try to make the best decisions possible? Of course not-- things still matter whether or not you are blameworthy or not, and you still have to do things to get anywhere if you are blameworthy or not-- but the only thing that changes is the self-hatred and judgement. The moment you admit that you didn't make yourself and you were simply thrown into this mess, you can accept that things could only have been as they have been and not any other way.

I think life is pretty bad for most people, regardless if some of the old problems have seemingly gone away or reduced. That's how the magic trick gets done-- old problems like food scarcity and basic medical care etc do go away, this is true. It's also true that novel access to positive experience goes up through things like technology, drugs, more and more sophisticated art and literature, etc. That much I will say is true. But the cost of these things doesn't make it worth it.

And if we aren't, we're usually uniquely low in resistance to all the malicious stupidity in the world, or people who are simply too confused to even recognize that they're being an asshole in light of them dying one day, which *should* trigger the recognition that one shouldn't be a piece of shit to other conscious beings. We reliably fail here.\n\nSuicide is one option, and an option I wouldn't ever blame anyone for. It's simply the case that this universe isn't that great of a universe. It's better to not be born in this universe. This is the universe where(NSFL) [this happens to children](https:\/\/youtu.be\/m_6Y5H9ngZc?t=86). And that's just the luckier ones, because it could always be [like this](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez#Abuse_and_murder). Or [even worse](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo). So perhaps it's time to stop sugar coating things? We live in [this](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KLpM0bo.jpeg) world. Not Disney. Not Star Wars or Lord of the Rings where things always end well and the good guys win and the bad guys are cheesy and stick out like a sore thumb because they're always in black armor or have red swords and so on. Reality is the opposite of this.\n\nThe bad guys in reality are [camouflaged through sophisticated evolutionary timescales](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv). They look [perfectly normal and are charming](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cmp43eP.png) insofar as we don't know their true nature. Evolution does Evil a trillion times better than George Lucas or Tolkien or any ambitious horror movie director. It does this by making it *not* look evil-- that's how the trick is done.\n\nSo since this is a hellish world, the desire to promptly exit it will be there, especially since winning appears impossible. But this is only a proper strategy if it's truly a maximally losing game. If our universe rewards evil to such an extreme degree that simply being alive, thinking thoughts, and problem solving, reliably empowers evil, then death is urgent. But if losing less is possible, one may need to stick around to try to slightly dial down how hellish the world becomes. The problem with this strategy is the old saying: \"The road to hell is paved by good intentions\". But in our case, the road is long paved-- we've reached the city limits and are now scaffolding the infrastructure.\n\nWhy is winning impossible though? Simply due to the game theoretical dynamics between evil and power, which mean that to defeat evil, one would need to be a greater evil. Since evil traits are the traits of psychopathy: callous, domineering, self-absorbed, manipulative, deceptive, charming, fearless, lacking aversion to risk, sadomasochistic-- and these traits are the very traits which climb power structures(unlike what all the Hollywood and Disney bullshit says which we've been force fed us from birth), then one cannot be good and \"win\" a dominance game. That's for fairy tales, not real life. In real life, winning in terms that are real to us, are purely expressions of [power](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=197). These traits are utterly sadistic and callous, and the powerful species we belong to has [perfected](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FMepy_THcOg?t=13) the expression of these behaviors [over time](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/).\n\nTo spell it out for you, what this means is both political narratives are sheer fantasy. The right believes things were once good, and now they're being defiled. The benevolent won history, worked hard for greatness, and that greatness has been spoiled or is at risk. We must make it great *again*.\n\nWhat a load of horse shit. Not much better than the psychosis of the left:\n\nEvil has been oppressing the world forever, but through the magic of progress, we can fix things. We can make things right. It doesn't have to be this way, things clearly have changed for the better. It's not that power gets stronger and stronger, and the peasants get dumber and dumber while being placated with the fruits of technology and leisure. It is the meek and the people who are in power, so get mad! Burn the world so that *finally* something beautiful can emerge!\n\nLiterally brain damaged.\n\nBoth narratives are children's stories. The reality is, this place appears to be a kind of larval form for something very much like Lovecraft's Great Old Ones. Malignancy and cruelty and deception only get progressively worse, and worse, and worse. Power is identical ontologically and metaphysically, to the physics of a black hole. Its gravity impinges on everything around it, and once you're stuck in its field, [you have no choice](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall-rhardcorenature). You don't get to negotiate. Power is evil. Power only gets stronger. And power wins here.

See if you can recognize that fact first: You're in a scenario where it feels like you're drowning, and to save yourself you have to attempt to swim, but you're drowning and too panicked to even recognize things like, \"I'm in an ocean right now\" or \"I think you're supposed to paddle with your hands, and kick with your legs.\" or \"Remember to avoid gulping in lots of water\" -- etc. \n\nWhen we're suffering deeply this way, then none of that can even enter the bandwidth of our heads. It's just one worry, one regret, one fear, one anguish, after the next. Can't even come up for air-- which creates a feedback loop of even more suffering.\n\nIt would help a ton if you could just sit somewhere quiet, close your eyes, breathe in slowly, naturally, deeply-- and then breathe out just as slowly and naturally, and just rest appreciate the mechanics of that drowning in negative thought; how it's a feedback, how it prevents any kind of clear look at the situation, etc.\n\nYou can repeat that step as much as you want-- it doesn't hurt to grasp that fact with even more clarity.\n\nWhat else can we recognize? You feel behind, deficient, broken, unskilled, unintelligent-- these are all insecurities, right? But are they meaningful? They *feel* that way, of course. That's undeniable-- that feels really bad. But we really care if they're true or make sense, too. Do they? How do any of these things make sense if we admit that you probably got a bad hand in life? Things didn't happen in a way you'd say was ideal, right? And who is to blame for that? Society(You know, the thing which tells you that you *ought* to feel bad for not being an amazing perfect person, who can drive, who has a degree, who is intelligent, who has a great job, a great life, and is always happy) would tell you that **you** are to blame. But is this true?\n\nNo. And that's not an answer that's just said to make you feel better. That's an answer that is literally what all the evidence points to. You cannot *possibly* be responsible for the things you have been told you are worthy of being blamed for. What *determines* this? Your genes. Your parents. Your environment\/upbringing. Your peer groups, your socioeconomic status, your luck, etc. You picked none of it. You were just thrown into this world and then the world says: \"Now feel bad if you don't meet up to our standards\", and everyone gets different advances and disadvantages. So... how on Earth is this a fair game? It's not only a rigged game, it's a rigged game that gaslights you on top of it and pretends to not be rigged.\n\nNotice how much of your suffering is a confusion around that former game. \"I'm so behind in life\". Behind by... whose standards? Who are you comparing yourself to? Some famous musician? Some person who got so much more than you? That makes about as much sense as someone who was far less lucky than you, comparing themselves to you, and thinking: \"I wish I was u\/dollwater-- she has *everything* I wish I had\". It just doesn't make sense, right? You have your own unique wisdom, because no one else is you. You're the only you that exists on Earth, and that's by definition special.\n\nIf the boyfriend is truly abusive then you should recognize that maybe you're the kind of person who easily gets victimized because they have such low self-worth(Again, it's just a fact that this is a confusion, like we said). I would take this part extra seriously. You've had a hard enough time, and you don't need a form of toxic co-dependency to weigh you down even more. Set an ultimatum please-- identify the abuse, communicate to your partner: No more abuse, and if that's too much to ask then you have to admit to yourself that something is deeply wrong with that, especially given what you've been through. I'm sure your partner also comes from a background of abuse, so just communicate as clearly as you can and open the door to them truly changing, maybe that's all they need. But if they're not, then it would be a real tragedy to keep convincing yourself that you don't deserve better or that the \"feel good nature\" of occasionally feeling wanted is somehow worth the trade-off of being abused even more-- that's going to suffocate you even more in the long run, since you **do** deserve better.

But there's nothing inherently good about endogenous chemicals, or inherently bad about exogenous chemicals. Even if some new substance was invented that offered some kind of utility to transforming experience and came with no negative side effects, I bet there would still be some negative stigma against it even if it's only subtle.\n\nI think this has to do with stuff like the naturalistic fallacy and around traits that strongly react to disgust or strongly latch onto ideas of \"purity\"(notice how the political cultures with higher purity\/disgust are historically anti-drugs?), but if a substance dramatically shakes up the every day experience, then it'll also be a kind of egocentric aversion, since anything that reduces or removes the self-model is a threat to the ego. This is unlike most drugs of addiction, which the ego generally is attracted to, so other ideas may be operative: \"God made us perfect\", \"Your body is a temple\", \"Pursuits of pleasure or eating from the tree of knowledge are sins\", etc.\n\nBut yeah, all of this contributes to poor intuitions about addiction. It's apparent when we stop drugs cold turkey with negative consequences. Sometimes we don't have this luxury of course and the addiction is so damaging that one has no other choice, but ideally, it seems like it can often be a good idea to gradually ease the body and mind off of a drug-- whether it be something addictive like opioids or alcohol or just something as common as an SSRI that has been legally prescribed under someone's supervision. It's like taking a rocky, unpaved, hilly road versus a paved flat road-- you'd need a good reason to take the former.\n\nThe analogy here is that the rocky road is sometimes going in the direct direction, but it's a **rocky** road.

To say depression is caused by a chemical imbalance rather than from abuse, neglect, ostracism, bullying, poverty, injustice, misfortune, and so on... is the equivalent to being stabbed repeatedly by a psychopath, and upon visiting the emergency room, being diagnosed wtih \"hemophilia\", prescribed coagulants and then sent back to the psychopath.\n\nThat's how autistic(not so much in the pejorative but in the descriptive sense, which means \"robotic\" or \"so smart, it's stupid\") our current system can be, and that's the values you seem to think are the only game in town for understanding reality.\n\nThis is similar to asking what \"the motive for demoralization\" is.

I assure you I have my moments of neurosis and even psychosis-- but I think that's actually a mark of sanity to admit. Anyone who would pretend otherwise is almost *certainly* insane. The sorts of subjects I write\/think about are generally psychologically destabilizing, either causing depression\/anxiety, derealization, or anti-social behavior, but for me the biggest thing is just trying to take mental fitness seriously. That's why I recommend mindfulness meditation every now and then, even though I know it's kind of futile to do or maybe even counterproductive. It's sort of like telling someone to \"just spend 175 days a year doing deadlifts, and you'll see immense improvements in strength and feel better\". No one wants to hear that advice, even though chances are high that the average person could squeeze this into their lives somehow if they really tried, and they would not regret it in the long run.\n\nBut it's worse than that, because at least people have some sort of intuition that picking up a heavy object and putting it back down leads to real physical progress. This intuition doesn't exist for training the mind. But it's really quite identical in concept: Sit and dedicate time out of the day to doing nothing other than paying very precise attention, and attention and clarity improve.\n\nUnlike physical strength, which is generally impossible to get around life without(gravity and bipedalism and just life in general force us to have *some* muscle mass), mental clarity is not mandatory, and many of us will swim through life while actually drowning the entire time, without even realizing it.\n\nThe difference between not drowning and swimming as an analogy to states of mind isn't even comparable to strength. The analogy I would use to strength would be, imagine almost everyone on Earth had severe muscular atrophy, and this was the norm. Gravity would be a problem. Life would be a struggle. But there was a method to gradually increase anabolism, without any drugs. And this was free, anyone could do it.

And the more one trained this way, they realized a) how weak they are, and b) how this is basically a superpower if one just took the simple exercise seriously. That's how severe the problem is, I think.\n\nBut despite this, if you told someone, \"Hey, I know a method you should do... it's basically the most important thing you could **possibly** do, no matter what it is you're going for in life.\" They would not only be uninterested, but their odds of doing it would actually *decrease* the more you tried to explain.\n\n\"Are you trying to be successful somehow? Do this. Are you trying to enjoy long walks on the beach? Do this. Are you trying to prevent boredom? Do this. Are you trying to sit at home doing nothing but eating ice cream and watch movies? Do this. Are you trying to commit suicide? Do this.\" \n\nNo matter what one's project is, simply doing this training will enhance those endeavors significantly. But almost no one would take it seriously for certain strange psychological reasons, and also some valid reasons, like skepticism.

I can only speak for hetero dynamics, but I think it's just an utterly toxic game where both genders in this picture are oriented to make each other miserable. Usually one person \"wins\", and that either plays out in a way where this person is a bit further along the cold and callous spectrum(stereotypically the man, but it could just as easily be the woman), in which case it becomes a more abuser-abusee dynamic(the requirement to this is one partner generally cares and the other partner generally doesn't). The other common dynamic is where there's no clear abuser but a clear two-way co-dependency kind of thing where both people are utterly abusive to each other *and* simultaneously the victims of each other.\n\nA sane relationship is basically one where both parties are deeply sensitive to their own egos, genuinely love each other, commit to honesty with each other, forgive each other liberally, and spare each other of their own egos in a way that constantly nourishes the relationship like a fragile plant. That's my best effort at a rosy picture here, and the bar for that is just so absurdly high it seems like it only happens in the movies or something. Lots of relationships masquerade as this while having deep, subtly abusive elements, but if you look carefully it's generally not subtle. The end result is people are forced to just distance themselves because who wants to get tortured this way? Who wants to pretend? Who wants to play ego vs. ego?\n\n You see this with sex most often, it's usually this that really breaks things down once things break down. It's a strong indicator that the relationship isn't going great if one or more parties are sexually frustrated. This is written carefully, because it doesn't mean \"Having lots of sex = good relationship\", it's just pointing to the very common tension that develops around sex, since neither person wants to be exploited ideally and neither person wants to take advantage of the other. But it's due to exactly these concerns that both people basically end up miserable, since these circumstances just make cooperation very difficult. That's why I think it's so important to just not be an egomaniac to have a good relationship, which is... almost impossible to find, on top of other compatibility issues like attraction, sharing interests, etc. There's a real relief in just letting go of this search.\n\nAnother very important variable is people with CPTSD feel broken and incomplete unless a person loves them and makes them feel validated. But that's who they *already* are right now. Everyone deserves some sort of ideal happy ending. No one deserves to suffer. Just acknowledging that makes one recognize that it's almost as if you have that love and validation right now-- you can recognize it in yourself. But we fail to realize this and set ourselves up for failure. This creates a kind of torturous cycle where you feel broken\/incomplete, you then put yourself out there, you attract the wrong people or just attract people who themselves were traumatized and fall into the bad dynamics I described, become more frustrated\/feel more invalidated, etc. \n\nSo yeah, just here to remind you that you don't need someone to have value-- you have value **right now**.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631513873,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hcnu2a1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pn47jk","locked":false,"name":"t1_hcnu2a1","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_pn47jk","permalink":"\/r\/CPTSD\/comments\/pn47jk\/deleted_by_user\/hcnu2a1\/","retrieved_on":1650194213,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"CPTSD","subreddit_id":"t5_2vvid","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/CPTSD","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Which I think is virtually guaranteed to happen. Just a matter of time. I'm cynical towards trans-humanism and related values for this reason. One of the core *problems* with evil is egocentrism. Without egocentrism, there's just no evil. It's incompatible. There's no Hitler without ego. There's no Jeff Bezos without ego. There's no George W. Bush without ego. There's no pressing the button to spray agent Orange without ego. There's no [ling chi](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/) without ego. There aren't even *suicide bombers* without ego-- that's how counterintuitive and paradoxical things can get. Every grand disaster humans produce, is propped up by several pillars of ego.\n\nWhat does this have to do with aging? For starters, the only coherent aversion to death is in the context of the self-model and the ego. This is why an experience where one loses\/lowers ego is called ego *death*. It truly feels like dying-- a panicked clawing and grasping of the black hole in each of us as it loses its absurd mass, throwing a violent but also pathetic tantrum like an entitled child.\n\nAnti-aging is a kind of relatively benign(or sometimes well intentioned, insofar as that is possible) egocentrism. This benign egocentrism is then co-opted by evil(obviously malign egocentrism), to produce the technology to sustain the ruler of reality indefinitely, much like [Christopher Hitchens describes the Abrahamic God as a totalitarian dictator](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=p4frOWZjvh0). I think lots of things we do may funnel into evil this way(like me writing this reddit post, or you quietly reading it), but some things more than others. Anything that lets powerful people remain powerful or express power, is higher on this list, and anti-aging seems like a top spot contender for obvious reasons. That Hitchens video is deeply relevant here in another way, so I do recommend it just to help identify the egocentrism of religion and one of it's core functions: Death denial(To return to the theme in the first paragraph here: There's no Josef Fritzl without ego).\n\nI've entertained this kind of ultra-conservative kind of philosophical position trying to solve the problem of evil as I see it. Antinatalism, promortalism, efilism, quietism, ludditism, etc, these are all conservative in nature. It's really still unclear to me though. On one hand I think the answer can't be to pretend grandiose revolutionary progress is possible, because so far, it's co-opted by evil or obscures the nature of reality in seemingly every instance. [We have paid only mild to moderate prices for our egocentric endeavors](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/transcoded\/7\/7a\/342-usaf-11034_Medical_Aspects-Hiroshima.webm\/342-usaf-11034_Medical_Aspects-Hiroshima.webm.480p.vp9.webm), but we don't consider what a truly nightmarish terror technology would do to either to Earth, or the universe. It really gets much worse if we take \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" seriously as a path forward. The worry here is of course we lounge in our own ignorance and never discover what we don't yet know about problems that would change our positions on things. But the risk to discovering this is a truly hellish universe, in at least two senses.\n\nIn one sense, it is via the universe we engineer ourselves through which we discover hell, because it seems Evil dominates Earth by simply examining nature and history. So we can suspect that if we just let things progress naturally(What else *could* we do?), something like cosmic horror isn't absurd to predict emerging from our world(if it hasn't already). In another sense, discovering hell is not found in ourselves or the world we make, but it is the thing we meet if we do decide to \"come to our senses\" on some kind of ultra-conservative strategy. If we do not move forward, we may be like the indigenous people who met the plague carrying and militarily sophisticated Europeans in history: Victims of domination machines that evolved elsewhere and were \"luckier\" to get the perks of \"winning\". So like most things in life, we're simply asked to pick which of several roads to hell we wish to take. Not a trivial choice, by the way-- I believe this is the *only* real ethical dilemma in our world: Which moves are the *least* losing moves?","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631518858,"distinguished":null,"edited":1631519995.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hcnzyvi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_picv5w","locked":false,"name":"t1_hcnzyvi","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_picv5w","permalink":"\/r\/TrueAntinatalists\/comments\/picv5w\/thoughts_on_antiageing\/hcnzyvi\/","retrieved_on":1650193736,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TrueAntinatalists","subreddit_id":"t5_2e4o2i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TrueAntinatalists","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

One is we can just put a little bit more effort into being clear, with caveats, couching things in exceptions, avoiding black and white thinking or absolute language. We won't always succeed, but this can help a lot.\n\nAnother thing is, notice how much the *worry* of being misunderstood plays into this in an insidious way. Imagine I'm trying to communicate something to you, but I'm just drowning in worry about being misunderstood while engaging in the already difficult task of trying to speak clearly to you. This likely can't help more than it harms, right?\n\nOne final thing we can do is just read more. I will sometimes find people and be amazed at how well they write and pretty much always they turn out to be avid readers. Reading makes a big difference in expressing ideas I think. Best of luck, and remember, don't worry too much because language is simply a huge burden for everyone, whether they realize it or not.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631540443,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hcotuaq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pldof7","locked":false,"name":"t1_hcotuaq","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pldof7","permalink":"\/r\/Schizotypal\/comments\/pldof7\/verbal_incoherency\/hcotuaq\/","retrieved_on":1650191326,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizotypal","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlzo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizotypal","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I think there a few ways to think ourselves out of this problem. First just acknowledge that you don't have the worst life on Earth. This isn't to invalidate your unique pain, since this isn't some event at the suffering Olympics. But just notice how bad(NSFL) [certain lives](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo) really are. This also includes [animals](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FMepy_THcOg?t=12), since we can't account for the fact that we're born human.\n\nWe can't account for *anything* about us, in fact. So even if you're angry at the worst people in the world, the most selfish, cruel, callous, deceptive, etc-- just recognize that these people didn't sit there as if in some \"character creation\" screen in a video game deciding who they would be-- they're just thrown into the world and are in some ways lucky, yes, but also in some ways very unlucky to be the person they became. Because if they could only know better( generally they can't-- that's what keeps bad people bad), then they would feel intense shame and guilt and be mortified, and never wish to do what they did again.\n\nSo resentment at others is out the window once we acknowledge the above. It's no longer rational, and only forgetting what we know about reality makes resentment possible. The moment we're thinking clearly, we're no longer resenting. But now there's still this hatred and despair. \n\nThere's still *this mess*, right? This world seems just *bad*. How on Earth is this not a rigged game? It's simply rigged, and that triggers despair and general anger. If this place is bad, then what's the right thing to do? One option is to sit there and just wallow\/ruminate. That's a popular choice, but what about just recognizing that everyone is suffering in *some* way by being here? We're all in this boat together. And part of what makes it bad is all of us being totally self-absorbed to the point of causing ourselves and others misery. So to me it seems crucial as a first step to reduce that thought pattern, by no longer valuing self-concern so highly, valuing \"big picture\" thinking, and so on.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631587562,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hcrv3ig","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pni1rm","locked":false,"name":"t1_hcrv3ig","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_pni1rm","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/pni1rm\/im_envious_of_the_world_and_so_full_of_hate\/hcrv3ig\/","retrieved_on":1650182512,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Not in principle, and not even remotely close to the scope and scale at which they do. There's no law of physics that says this *has* to be so and we must grind forward. \"Nike: Just do it\" or \"Harder. Better. Faster. Stronger\" are not the only possible values available to us. The perfected state of things \"getting hurt as little as possible\" is a universe away from where we are, even in *attitude* alone.\n\nThat's what I think is the crucial variable here: Attitude. Attitudes are based on values, and our society, and specifically the sort of society that creates the conditions of the industrial revolution, where lower class people are tortured and martyred for the sake of propping up the dominance game of high class people(still the case today, by the way), is the specific substrate from which much of human misery emerges.\n\nSo I think the article is weirdly worded.

It's like saying \"Our muscles *have* to hurt in the gym, in order to get bigger\/stronger-- just to remind everyone, and the solutions to delayed onset muscle soreness are likely to come out via the motivations of the training culture.\"\n\n&gt; The belief that perfection is approachable has no evidence for it. Maybe that's what heat death is supposed to be. Do you see yourself as a utopian, or are you surprised by my objection to your objection to the moral you saw in this text?\n\nNo, of course I'm not surprised, this is the status-quo ontology, some form of anti-realism or nihilism(in this case, resulting from dogmatic pragmatism). There's also no evidence for why you shouldn't place your face in a tub of sulfuric acid. Or why raping children is *really* wrong. Or why 2+2 is *really* 4, if we're being *truly* skeptical. (I think there *is* evidence, but certain schools of thought would say no) This is how convoluted we get when we huff Hume's model airplane glue, and rigidly, autistically(again, non-pejorative, in the precise same prior context), double down on some narrow system of thought that allows us to pirouette around ever admitting certain things are abhorrent or insane.\n\nThere's usually no conversation to have if your partner can't admit something like ethics being an objective domain like math.\n\n\"But ethics isn't like math-- math is a purely empirical and falsifiab--\"... no. You *value* logic. We *ought* to be logical. Demonstrate to me why we *ought* to value logic. This sounds... downright ideological!\n\nYou cannot get to sanity through sheer pragmatism and is-statements(you can, just only in principle) It just takes too long, and tortures too many people before it gets to \"Ahh yes, *this* is why harming countless things is *really* wrong, such as infinitely torturing everything that's conscious, as a description of what words like \"wrong\" and \"infinitely torture\" mean in relation to phrases like \"everything that's conscious\". \"\n\nThis is the burden of pragmatism, despite all the amazing things it gets us. The only hope we have here to use pragmatism to get us out of pragmatism is along the lines of what Jonathan Haidt did when he explained that the two political extremes believe what they do as a function of the way they are. This helps expose how arbitrary and brittle the whole political scheme is. If we can do that for pragmatists and idealists, we may get a little closer(because pragmatism is the prevailing ideology).\n\nHere's how your attitude plays out in reality, ready? Just imagine a very threatening looking man with a sadistic grin on his face, much larger than you, forces himself onto you. He says, \"Hello, u\/redditsselloutbiddy! We've got your sulfuric acid ready! Bath time!\" As he grins with sadistic glee, barely containing himself. As you try to protest, he suddenly gets serious and reminds you there's no evidence for why the acid torture shouldn't take place. He says this truly earnestly, as if fact and argument from you, using *his* system, would actually convince him otherwise. The beauty here is, this language game is rigged in such a way for that to not be possible. He knows this, and deep down inside, he is intellectually jerking himself off with this knowledge while being all business up-front.\n\nSo you two have your little debate. You, essentially playing devil's advocate and only half-heartedly, simply have to grant him certain points(Rules are rules, after all-- and rules that work, are good! :) )He too, gives you a little refresher course on Hume and how he dropped the gavel on epistemology until the end of time, and this goes on with lots of patience on his part, but soon he thinks the arguments have been exhausted since you seem to agree with him more than you disagree, and he declares that it is in fact now acid time. A charitable demeanor that expresses academic rigor disappears, and the sadistic grin creeps back in.\n\nDue to being utterly jacked, this fellow pulls you closer and closer to the bucket. It's at this point when reality would set in for you:\n\n\"This is... fucking *insane*. This whole system of thought... is insane. What's about to happen here is *objectively* evil. If **anything** is evil, **this right here** is evil. Not in a \"I think chocolate cake is the best dessert\" kind of way\", but **actually** so, like \"The Earth revolves around the sun\". \"\n\nYou don't notice, but you think all of this out loud, and Bubba is taken aback: \"Huh, maybe ethics really is a purely objective domain like math...\" Bubba says, and tells you that you two should really get this right. Your pragmatism comes flowing back in as drug cartel levels of cruelty are no longer imminent, and you go back to informing Bubba when his arguments are orthogonal or when he's dealing with the content or rather speaking on some meta-level, you very precisely and with impressive adherence to the rules of rationality remind him that your panic to being gruesomely killed just now was merely a subjective, brittle, value-expression that doesn't *really* cohere with some objective description of what is ethi--\n\n\"Torture time!!!\" -- Bubba yells excitedly, and quickly shoves your face close to the bucket of acid. You scream in panic:\n\n\"OH GOD, OH FUCK. OH MY FUCKING GOD... NO... THIS IS WHAT REALLY MATTERS. THIS IS WHAT **REALLY** MATTERS... !!!\"\n\nHe pulls your head back. \"Hmmm... was that *prescriptive* though? Orrrrr.... *descriptive*?\" He shoves your face next to the chemical surface that will liquefy your face. \"OH FUCK... OH FUCK...\".\n\nYou can repeat this as much as you like, but the fact of the matter is there's nothing quite like the lucidity of face + acid. Certain languages are designed in such a way that **only** face+acid gets to a resolution, and they are very reliable in dissolving(heh) certain bullshit language games that prop up psychopathic values we don't *actually* hold, when push comes to shove, or when face comes to acid. It's easy to fail to recognize that this is distinct from torture, despite being similar in many ways. Bubba has no motive, he's just trying to figure out reality along with you. He doesn't care if you hold position x or y. Bubba would recognize what matters too, if he was forced into imminent acid+face. You could say, \"But what if he *wasn't*?\" What if Bubba thinks acid+face is a grand ol' time? What if he manages to do it and then even double down? Well, the fact that people disagree about ethics has nothing to do with there not being a fact of the matter. There are better explanations here, like:\n\n\"Bubba is a sadomasochist and a psychopath, and we should isolate Bubba from influencing ethics, because his brain is no good for making sense of ethics.\"","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631620989,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hct63gi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pnkhoa","locked":false,"name":"t1_hct63gi","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_hcsty2z","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/pnkhoa\/someone_has_to_get_hurt_occasionally\/hct63gi\/","retrieved_on":1650178731,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

And again, the antidote to that is an ego-destroying experience, like torture or some comparable misfortune, certain drugs(psychedelics) and introspection\/training.\n\nIf someone thinks death is the worst thing possible, they just haven't [tasted the rainbow](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo) of what's possible on Earth.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631623992,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hctbh76","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_po08pn","locked":false,"name":"t1_hctbh76","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_hctaywm","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/po08pn\/the_evolutionary_purpose_of_dystopia\/hctbh76\/","retrieved_on":1650178293,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Maybe only if we speak about psychedelics? But most people will have an \"Oh shit\" moment at some point in their lives that slaps them out of their self-absorbed fantasy world in some sense.\n\n&gt; It's funny. I've actually been a lot more afraid of death since I took psychedelics, than I was before I did. I think it's because, while I saw that there are other layers to the universe than this one, the one thing most of them have in common, is that they are a LOT less coherent.\n\nHmmm, well I definitely don't think psychedelics are some kind of silver bullet. Sometimes they can potentiate ego. There's a strong survivorship bias and related narcissism that can emerge from experiencing otherworldly hell and returning to \"reality\". Or you can experience an eternity that screams:\n\n\"This idea of 'you' is not the center of everything that is important. 'You' are not the main character of a movie. 'This' is bigger than you. You will die. Everyone dies. Stop being an asshole and stop missing the point.\"\n\n...and actually fail to learn the lesson. One can become a *bigger* asshole. Or one can simply panic *twice* as hard about the idea of dying. Part of this has to do with 'psychedelics' being quite a large range of effects that basically vaguely mean \"Things get weird when you take this\". Some of them really do have the potential to dissolve the self-model(LSD and psilocybin seems to be able to do this). It's not clear to me that something like DMT reliably triggers ego death(a very visual and possibly, but not necessarily, ego-potentiating experience), where as something like 5meoDMT seems to really \"bitchslap the self\"(like large doses of psilocybin or LSD do) for lack of a better description.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631627502,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hctisuq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_po08pn","locked":false,"name":"t1_hctisuq","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_hctc0l3","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/po08pn\/the_evolutionary_purpose_of_dystopia\/hctisuq\/","retrieved_on":1650177701,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

There are two distinctions I make: There's evil *as such*, and then the visible effects of evil. I fully grant you that the visible effects of evil seem to reduce with time. I can buy into a book like \"The Better Angels of Our Nature\" that way. But the fact of the matter is we have not escaped the selection game. Psychopathy simply *is* camouflage, if you'll grant that psychopathy is synonymous with evil conceptually(many people choose to pick this as the hill they die on in this argument, but it really is just pure pedantry).\n\nPsychopathy is a toolset that expresses domination. The traits of psychopathy are: Domineering, callousness, self-absorption, fearlessness, sadomasochism, low risk-aversion, deception, manipulation, charm, etc.\n\nThis is a brilliant strategy in a world where conscious beings are really mostly evolved for a prima-facie response to their competitive environment. One keeps up appearances insofar as its either unnecessary to reveal one's motivations, or one no longer needs to play pretend and [the mask](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cmp43eP.png) comes off.\n\nYou don't get to win an iterated game against a psychopath, no matter if modern game theory narratives say otherwise. To intuit this, just imagine two versions of elite sport players. Pick your favorite \"GOAT\" type athlete, clone them in a simulation, and have them play against each other endlessly within the constraints of the rules. Part of this scenario is the fact that there's no referee to enforce rules, mind you. This is how our universe appears to be. No gods, no mothership of benevolent aliens going, \"Bup bup bup! That's cheating. You can't *lie*... You can't *torture* your opponent...\" etc.\n\nSo they're equally skilled at the game, *except* give one of them the traits of evil, outlined above. Just turn all the dials up on those traits. First note that some of these traits *already* exist in any GOAT-type athelete. That's what words like \"domineering\" *mean*, broadly speaking. Fearlessness is crucial to high-stakes performance. Deception is bread and butter to out-dribbling someone in something like basketball or European football. But just turn the dial up on the total trait-set called \"psychopathy\", and the winner is clear.\n\n Give this game enough time and the less evil player will simply be exhausted. They're less self-absorbed, they've got less motivation to crush and destroy their enemy, their neurology is just not *that* fine tuned for trickery, they care more about right and wrong by definition so they're less oriented to cheat, and so on. It's purely a disadvantage. The only thing that changes crucially once you introduce a complex social context, is *concealing* all of this through charm\/deception\/manipulation as phenotypic expressions. This is someone like Bill Gates dressing like a lower-middle class high school teacher and eating a cheap burger. It's a precise analog to [this](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv).

The brain is just utterly at the mercy of thought and emotion, and part of this is precisely not being able to realize it. The only way to realize it is have this narrative and modeling disrupted somehow. Either through certain drugs, certain intense experiences, or long term introspection. Even this isn't a guarantee, though.\n\nIf you think you avoid monkey moments, just sit, eyes closed and pay attention to your mind. Sit, for 10 to 20 minutes, using your breath as the anchor-- the thing you're paying attention to, and recognize how powerfully thoughts disrupt this simple activity. They disrupt it so powerfully that you will forget what you were even doing.

I'm actually open to panpsychism(and very open in general) due to an interest in phenomenology, which I don't see as *requiring* neurons, but rather I think it could easily be the other way around. More on that in a bit. NU comes roughly close to where I am ethically but I think it's too rigid and centered around one broad thing(suffering) in a way that can lend itself to be misapplied by say, some robot\/AI(or robotic-thinking human). But yes, suffering captures much of ethical salience, there I agree. When I say \"the other way around\", we know enough to say that it is the brain that generates a separateness phenomenology or the brain that delineates, and what we call consciousness could very well be intrinsic to... stuff\/everything\/the substrate of reality... for lack of better terms. Humans have roughly tested this when they do things like say, take huge doses of psychedelics which cause the boundaries of self to dissolve. We don't *quite* know what's going on there for sure, so this at least keeps my foot in the door re: panpsychism.\n\n&gt; but it’s not nihilism that requires disingenuous indifference to a face full of acid. It says there’s a right way to go, and we go that way as fast as we can whether we’re trying or not. A physicalist reification of MLK’s “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” Or in contemporary nomenclature, “Moloch always swims left.”\n \nI'm not saying nihilism requires us to pretend torture isn't really bad, but rather that the product of such behavior *is* nihilistic, and props up psychopathic attitudes and traits(deception, sadomasochism, callousness, etc). But yeah, I don't think I agree that things tend to improve and evil tends to get weaker. I'd say that things *appear* to improve, and evil tends to get stronger. Moloch swimming left is a meme that ultimately serves Moloch and pacifies(dominates) the things Moloch expresses power over, both in practice and in principle.\n\n&gt; So: I accept that there is potential for a nuanced and roughly accurate moral grasp, utilizing empathy, of which some psychopaths have been rendered incapable by physics\/biology\/society. \n\nI actually buy into the arguments against empathy here, and on top of it I think it's untrue that psychopaths lack it. I suspect they can have a high sensitivity to the emotions of others, but due to other traits and values, perhaps they just aren't harmed by the negative states of others when they \"empathize\". We have very rigid conceptual schemes of this word \"empathy\" that I think may cause us to misdiagnose what's going on in the mind of a psychopath. This trait gets hashed out basically among other psychopathic traits, like callousness, and sadomasochism. Empathy is feeling what another feels, yes, but I think it is still contextualized by the way in which one *is*. If someone with high empathy sees someone bleeding out and they happen to be a masochist that would get aroused at the sight of their disfigurement, well... this empathy isn't going to do much, at least in the way we'd expect in common social contexts. We'll easily misdiagnose such a person as \"not having empathy\". This is something like what I think could be going on with psychopathy.\n\n&gt; But I do not accept that rejecting nihilism leads necessarily to rejecting pragmatism. \n\nI don't actually reject pragmatism, I acknowledge its value. You can't really do science or math without it. But I do believe there *is* such a thing as pathological pragmatism, and I believe it's endemic to our world. I would define it as a rigidity that pragmatism is the only game in town. This game is summed up by the phrase: \"We must first gather all of the fine grained details to *properly* get to the big picture!\". The opposite value system to this is idealism, which inverts this: \"We must look at the big picture to *properly* get to all of the fine grained details!\" Both are operative to degrees, but one is very clearly dominant.\n\nThey both want the same thing, but they don't agree on how to get there. And since pragmatism has an edge in \"working\"(it's just not *pragmatic* to create idealistic models-- simply a happenstance that says nothing about which is *truly* better, only which is better in a superficial sense). I think both are important, and both have pros and cons, but currently we really do pretend as if one is useless and the other is the only game in town. And I think that's bad and harms everyone(notice how your average committed pragmatist could just dismiss this sentence as value laden? That too, is a feature of why it is bad and harms everyone).\n\n&gt; Pragmatic rhetoric can certainly be weaponized by psychopaths, but so can pretty much every rhetoric as far as I’ve been able to notice. Here, I am concerned that you are weaponizing utopian rhetoric. In other words, sanctimoniously deriding evil without providing any positive information to help immanentize your eschaton. To the extent actionable solutions are not included, ideological rhetoric is a grift that profits from the existence of a problem without helping to solve it.\n\nI think the key point is that there are some systems psychopaths simply thrive in, and other systems psychopaths struggle in. That's the difference-- so it's not meaningful to say psychopaths thrive under any rhetoric even though it's a technically true point. It's not an accident that robust moral realism is not the norm in our ethics departments. It's not an accident that we can't admit a range of basic facts about ethics-- the sexual, physical, psychological abuse of children, inequality, war, animal torture, etc. It's not an accident that the way ethical concerns appear in our world, mostly through modern politics, are utterly shallow and miss the point and effortlessly incites emotions\/violence\/division\/unethical behaviors and consequences.\n\nSo I guess I'd tell you to worry less that I'm weaponizing utopian rhetoric and just smell the coffee with regard to how miserably our world fails ethically. To someone who is dogmatically committed to pragmatism, the antidote is clear: More pragmatism. But this again just doesn't solve the problem I've pointed out: One doesn't solve psychopathy because it's not even on pragmatism's radar(in a meaningful way-- we're not up in arms right now as a species to utterly vanquish the traits that cause human misery in our species, at least not in some sane way), it's incapable(at this stage) of saying \"We ought to stop giving people acid baths\" or \"People who want to give people acid baths are evil, and that's bad. *Actually* bad. As a matter of fact.\". \n\nYou can't \"provide positive information\" without first admitting that evil exists, evil wins, evil thrives here, and certain systems prop up evil. With those road blocks in the way, there's just no way to move forward. This is what \"admitting a big picture\" first means. I don't think there's necessarily some \"final solution\" or \"final state\" ethically in practice as far as I'm concerned, there are just gradations of total states, and these states are less or more ethical(as a matter of *fact*, not opinion). I don't value filling in the blanks here very much as an idealist, I value just *admitting* that such a thing exists. That's my big picture starting point. Pragmatists refuse this, because they *must* autistically(I need to keep saying this isn't pejorative), go dot by dot by dot in accordance to a rigid \"connect-the-dots\" system, and even when the picture is 99.999% complete, they *still* wouldn't admit certain facts(Rules are rules!-- this is the *pathology* of rule orientation-- it can't get to certain rules because other rules block this path off). (Also, I'm speaking metaphorically when I say \"99.999% complete\"-- so please don't tunnel on the fact that the phrase \"99.999% complete\" suggests some final total idealistic utopia in practice-- that's not helpful to understand what I believe\/how I see things)\n\n(End of part one)\n\n[Part two](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/pnkhoa\/someone_has_to_get_hurt_occasionally\/hcvk3tl\/)","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631657244,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hcvk2ka","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pnkhoa","locked":false,"name":"t1_hcvk2ka","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_hcuatoo","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/pnkhoa\/someone_has_to_get_hurt_occasionally\/hcvk2ka\/","retrieved_on":1650171734,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Naturally it can be misapplied like any other tool, deployed in bad faith by the antisocial. There is good reason for the allergy race theorists have to scientific institutions, and real barriers to these groups achieving ownership of empirical tools for their own ends. I am very sympathetic to people who feel gaslit by institutional ways of knowing. It would be really cool if I could help heal some of that along the way, though I’m not sure how.\n\nThis is all perfectly compatible with what I think. I'm not anti-science, we need to do science and we need to model reality and steer ourselves and others away from hellish worlds. The problem I have is with granting the empirical domains like math and science, but then pretend as if ethics is somehow value laden and cannot be an empirical domain. They're ontologically identical as far as I'm concerned, so it's one or the other-- completely double down on anti-realism and say 2 and 2 don't really make 4, or admit ethical facts really are facts like any other fact. I would argue the anti-realist has a tough time maintaining their position once the sulfuric acid comes into play, as you know. \n\nTo be more direct: I think it's fart sniffing bullshit, which is... everywhere, academically and in \"intellectual cultures\", in the year 2021. People see some peak of human advancement because they see how far we've come, but me, as an idealist, sees a dark of age of embarrassing amounts of ignorance. Purely a glass half full\/half empty orientation dichotomy that is mutually compatible to some degree, but since the sky is the limit and we're close to rock bottom being intellectual infants at the point we call \"2021\", one view here really is more in touch with reality than the other.\n\nTo understand that, think of intelligence. A not uncommon sophisticated view of intelligence goes: \n\n\"There is no such thing as \"Smart\", but rather intelligence is simply relative-- it's a gradient. Humans may *feel* smart being a dominant Earth species, and rats may seem \"dumb\" by comparison, but we can't *objectively* call humans smart and rats dumb.\" \n\nThis sounds right to someone who has not thought about the problem very deeply. Once you think in huge scopes and scales, then this view dissolves. Intelligence is still relative in some sense, but if we know that something can have incomprehensible intelligence( shouldn't be controversial but hey-- almost anything can be deconstructed via pragmatism), then rats are simply *objectively* dumb. And humans aren't too far off from rats, they're *objectively* dumb, too. The closer one is to rock bottom, the closer one is to having the intelligence *of* a rock, and this proximity is exposed in objective terms once we zoom out. A ceiling may not be clear, but it doesn't have to be. All one needs to grant is that rock bottom *is* clear. To feel otherwise is basically to *be* human here and suffer from a perspectival illusion around the nature of intelligence. The same effect of perspectival confusion occurs with our appraisal of \"how far we've come\" and our overconfidence in our pragmatic systems.\n\n&gt; Everyone knows the capitalism we have now benefits narcissists and psychopaths at the expense of basic human decencies. Everyone also knows the food chain we have now benefits apex megafauna at the expense of countless babies who live only to suffer and die. Most people deal with these two uncomfortable truths by narrowing their sphere of ethical concern.\n\nI don't consider it pedantic to dispute this on a few levels. First the simple fact is that only a minority know that our current system is insane. It may be a passing thought here and there, but as far as lucidity of this goes, this is considered a schizophrenic delusion on average, here on Earth. The scope and scale of misery is even less acknowledged. Almost no human being alive at this moment is lucid of the fact that the place we're in is, beyond metaphor, a sadistic meat grinder. This may not be the worst hell, but it is very firmly and clearly on the hell side of the gradient. No one wakes up every day acknowledging this fact, not even many of the worst off human beings(for obvious adaptive reasons), but **especially** not the \"best off\"(for again, very obvious adaptive reasons).\n\nThat is very difficult to dispute as far as I'm concerned and disputing it, to me, raises red flags(this means that I see red flags in virtually everyone in my own species). I don't think people narrow their sphere of ethical concern, either-- I think it's *simply* narrowed as such, as a function of adaptive traits, both at the small scale level, and at things like the cultural level. Psychopathic genes, psychopathic memes. Humanity is in some sense *intrinsically* evil because they're the product of the hellish meat grinder that reliably rewards superficial goodness but punishes genuine goodness in the long run. As an atheist, I think the Christians were right-- just by sheer accident through their mythological ignorance in the form of some kind of accurate pattern detection: \"Sin\" exists, it's just a set of traits embedded into DNA, and humanity is doomed with it currently. There's no benevolent God to provide absolution, and Satan is crystallized in our universe as one moves the slider \"forwards\" through spacetime.\n\n&gt;  Anecdotally, the most popular schema is to exclude non-humans from ethical consideration, while having a verbal commitment to humanity in the abstract paired with a literal commitment to their immediate social sphere (likely including a couple honorary non-humans). The next most common variations I observe are to extend some ethical consideration to domesticated non-humans, and to revoke it from some humans according to tribal lines (national, religious, ethnic most commonly). \n\nThe above is technically true, but I would point out the contradiction too, because you can't meaningfully say we \"exclude non-humans from ethical consideration, while having a verbal commitment to humanity in the abstract\" while also going \"Oh, but we also totally revoke it according to tribal lines.\". It's really one or the other when push comes to shove, even though I'm sure some kind of nuance and technicality and openness to paradox can exist here. But there's really a meaningful fact of the matter once these things get hashed out. My picture here is, as I've said: Humanity is simply psychopathic. Not just hilariously uncommitted to itself, but motivated to engineer and min-max suffering because sadomasochism is still such a crucial variable to maximize as domination machines. In this narrow bullshit superficial sense, it can be said to be \"committed to itself\", but these are purely gene-values expressed through humanity.\n\nYes, on some level *everything* can be called a gene value, but I distinguish things that don't win in the absolute sense, aka meaningful values, values around ethics, truth, etc--- from pure dominance. Genes **only** care about dominance, in the end. From the way children are treated by parents, to the way our school system works, to they way higher academia works, our economics, our medicine, our gender\/romance\/social dynamics, everything is built on these psychopathic values.\n\n(End of part two)\n\n[Part three](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/pnkhoa\/someone_has_to_get_hurt_occasionally\/hcvk54j\/)","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631657260,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hcvk3tl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pnkhoa","locked":false,"name":"t1_hcvk3tl","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_hcvk2ka","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/pnkhoa\/someone_has_to_get_hurt_occasionally\/hcvk3tl\/","retrieved_on":1650171731,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

So it’s unsurprising that arguing about the right things to do is an ever-massive part of what humans are about.\n\nHe probably can't solve poverty like a god, but he certainly *is* choosing not to alleviate human misery because he has psychopathic traits in spades. Lets just say his heart doesn't bleed for the tragedy of conscious beings getting tortured on this planet-- such a trait and others like it are mandatory to win the cut-throat game of the CEO leaderboards. You don't win this game as the Dalai Lama or as Mr. Rogers, and that says something very important about who actually calls the shots on Earth, but it only scratches the surface. So while both political extremes are funny in the head with their cartoonish representations, one side really is closer to being right on this subject, albeit by sheer accident and often for bad reasons.\n\n&gt; I’m apprehending that you come to such judgements as are expressed in your OP from the perspective that hierarchy creates moral hazard, and moral hazard causes suffering, so hierarchy is bad. Obviously that’s not a nuanced map, so if you could elaborate it might be helpful.\n\n&gt; How I see it is that hierarchy is an evident fact about how humans evolved, that we’ve been involving increasingly complex mental\/infoprosthetic machinery for navigating moral hazard, and that increasingly equitable social solutions are found through the “fuck around and find out” method -- just like new genetic adaptations.\n\nI guess there's nothing wrong with *some* hierarchies. Some hierarchies just scale favorably, like some kind of moral hierarchy or possibly a wisdom hierarchy. But once dominance enters the picture, then yes, by definition everything is impinged on by the black hole of pain-expression situated on the apex. And there's no solution other than a *bigger* black hole taking its place. This is just the physics of power in the context of genes or really any Darwinian being in our universe as far as I can see. If the traits get \"encoded\" somehow, then evil scales with entropic gradients(while getting more and more camouflaged where necessary). That simple. \n\nWhat you call \"equitable solutions\" I call bones thrown at the slaves to obfuscate absurd disparities in power and the implications of that power(evil-- something I believe is essentially synonymous with power, because evil can't reliably defeat good, and winning implies a context of power. If evil reliably wins, then where there is power, there is evil). [A visual aid of what power expression looks like in nature](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=185), and what [power expression looks like towards the excluded non-humans](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FMepy_THcOg?t=13). An average \"rationalist\" would die on the hill of the semantics of \"evil\", how animals can't be evil, or how evil is a brittle or subjective term, etc. Braindead anthropocentric nonsense and psychopathic memetics, if you ask me.\n\n&gt; Of course, everybody wants to fuck around and nobody wants to get fucked with. It’s a pyramid scheme. Everybody wants to eat, and nobody wants to get eaten. Everyone wants the freedom to do experiments and nobody wants the strictures of being experimented on. Life is not fair. But can it become fair? What are the physical limits of fairness?\n\nSome people genuinely do not want to \"fuck around\" though. And some *really* do. There's a huge range of orientation here, and those who are oriented a *certain* way, get rewarded. That is not only difficult to point out, but that is difficult to point out as a problem-- indeed, the most serious problem that exists on planet Earth right at this moment. Nothing even compares. You solve this one problem, and everything else collapses like dominoes. Instead we're told to \"deal with it\" and that \"life isn't fair\" or \"well we can't get *perfect* fairness, riiiiight?\" These are just red herrings that obscure the actual nature of what's going on. To properly grasp this, one has to imagine themselves strapped into an operating table with the BTK killer about to have a free-for-all, and saying these exact things. That's when we reach lucidity on this subject.\n\nBut yes, I do agree that it's a zero-sum game. Interestingly enough, the overwhelming narrative in game theory today(and someone can correct me if I'm wrong-- at least a *popular* narrative) seems to be \"Hey! It's actually *not* a zero sum game!\" Who does this idea benefit?(Truly one of my top 5 heuristics-- simply ask to any idea you encounter: \"**Who** does this idea benefit, ultimately?\")\n\n&gt; That’s why I brought up the hedonistic imperative, a proposed engineering solution to the problem of suffering. I am curious whether this is the kind of solution to continued moral hazard you find viable. If not -- what do you see as a literally possible improvement on the status quo? What does perfection look like to you?\n\nYeah Pearce is an interesting fellow and I think his heart is in the right place, but I think he doesn't account for psychopathy the way I do. He believes progress is possible and that \"the things that win\" in our world will somehow value his bliss-world. It's clear to me that he has not thought in depth about evil. Perfection to me looks like an indomitability with respect to hell gradients. This only exists in ideal terms and I doubt it's possible, but if you could just shut down reality completely, make everything go \"poof\", with zero chance of it returning, you'd be the greatest moral hero in the totality of reality. Hell presupposes stuff. If you just make stuff impossible, you make hell impossible. Insofar as stuff exists, hell has a non-zero chance of existence. Stop stuff, perfected protection against anything bad, which is intrinsically good.

Your reaction to someone touching you is totally normal. There are countless anti-social behaviors in our world, so being averse to a stranger touching you is perfectly fine behavior.\n\nI would question this idea that \"Society\" is normal, working properly, sane, and those who society calls \"disordered\" are abnormal, deficient\/broken, insane.\n\nEveryone's different somehow, there's no \"normal\", even even if there was, it wouldn't automatically be \"good\". These are purely arbitrary ideas. I don't think good and bad can be simply based on what is popular-- these words must have a deeper meaning than just whatever \"gets the most votes\". This idea does a lot of harm and causes people a lot of mental suffering, because they feel that if they don't fit in some how or deviate, there really is something wrong with them. So it's worse than just being untrue-- it actually causes *harm*, which makes it a very toxic idea that we should get rid of.\n\nI think being different and thinking different has some very positive sides to it. It's the basis of creativity. It's the opening to change old ways that are corrupt or wrong or ineffective. Just like with \"normal\", being different in itself isn't objectively good or bad, it's just *different*, and that's okay. Yes, people will *notice*, sometimes, but who cares? Who are they to say it's wrong to be weird? Nothing wrong with it.

When you notice thoughts have disrupted this process, recognize those thoughts as just another object, and return to sensations of breathing.

If you take a GOAT and have it play against a clone that has better capacity to learn than it does then the better learner will soon dominate. Did this prove that capcity for learning is the one true advantage and because it is a force fir good the weekend must be getting better am the time.\n\nThe problem with this is it doesn't admit the next step in the process, which is that capacity for learning(insofar as a domination orientation exists-- you have to *value* winning in this specific sense or else your knowledge on how to win doesn't get you anywhere), will *result* in psychopathic traits, since that's what wins. You're not going to discover that being deeply kind to your adversary, being deeply unegoic to the point of going \"Ehh, it's just a game, after all\", and so on, is some kind of highly optimal strategy here. There are simply sets of traits that win, and you could say learning gets you there and therefore demonstrates nothing meaningful about what wins, but it misses the point about what *actually* wins. What actually wins is not a mystery.\n\n&gt; Is similar to 2. Camouflage has downsides. The more visible a person and the more tractable their past the less time they can spend without their mask of. If someone is watched 24\/7 and all their decisions scruitised either someone will notice their a psychopath or they will have pretended to be an upstanding citizen so well they are indistinguishable from an upstanding citizen \n\nThis is a confusion of what I'm proposing. I'm *not* proposing a grand conspiracy, I'm proposing a totally natural phenomenon. There's not some willful mask on\/mask off calculation-- it's purely naturally occurring, without self-awareness. Bill Gates doesn't go \"Okay now I have to dress down like some lower middle class dude and eat at the shitty burger joint, they'll never sniff me out, AHAHAHAHAH!!!\" It's purely an expression of the phenotype. This is about the semantics of evil. Elon Musk, for example, is someone who I think is very plainly [a psychopath](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JF-KrSnixr4). You don't need to go on a serial killing spree to be one, you just need to be:\n\n* Domineering\n* Callous\n* Self-absorbed\n* Charming\n* Manipulative\n* etc etc etc\n\n&gt; This is a nice theory that doesn't fit well with data I see. The past seems riddled with people being cruel for cruelties sake. Today seems peaceful and stable by comparison. The chance that this nice sounding theory is wrong in some way is much greater than the chance that a secret conspiracy of psychopath s rule the world without anyone noticing in my opinion\n\nYes, so this is valid. The theory simply may not be falsifiable in practice, so it falls victim to \"just so story\" type criticisms. I would dismiss this criticism though if it's the only strong argument against it. But yes, this is simply unfortunately the case when evolution produces highly adapted camouflaged psychopaths-- you won't ever be able to truly demonstrate it to a hardcore skeptic because the world will appear to be making progress, appear to be more and more philanthropic, etc. A surface level look will *never* reveal what's going on with what I'm proposing, and it's not like you can round up all the people who hold power over Earth and run brain scans and psychological analyses on them.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631768995,"distinguished":null,"edited":1631769560.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hd1mcpu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pnkhoa","locked":false,"name":"t1_hd1mcpu","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_hcvlvhj","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/pnkhoa\/someone_has_to_get_hurt_occasionally\/hd1mcpu\/","retrieved_on":1650153834,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

If I played Federer at tennis then he wouldn't have to have a psychopathic desire to win in order to beat me. If we both had the exact same desire to win then he would.\n\nI think this term \"psychopathic desire\" isn't helpful to understand what I meant. Desires and values are related to traits. If one is domineering and self-aggrandizing and self-absorbed\/egomaniacal and sadistic, then the more and more traits we add on like this, the clearer we see something coalesce into a logically coherent set of values and desires oriented towards winning. Your opponent will begin to desire smashing you in tennis the more richly we color their trait-set. I am arguing that it is in fact psychopathic traits that create this motivation most meaningfully, **and** on top of it, provide the most strategically advantageous tool-kits to actually winning any iterated game.\n\nThis is what I mean when I distinguish learning how to win, and *being* a winner. Learning the rules of the game is not enough. Someone could intuit that being callous is going to help them smash opponents, but it's actually by *being* callous that is one of the keys to one of the many locks to *actually* smashing opponents. No one can really go, \"Oh okay, I guess it's time to be more callous! :)\". You are helpless to be *yourself*, whoever you are. You can't just be like Ted Bundy, even if some AGI oracle tells you \"Being like Ted Bundy is what wins\", and you happen to value winning. If you're facing Ted Bundy with Federer's tennis skill and you have the same knowledge while also having Federer's identical skill, you will lose(just run the sim long enough), because you won't **be** Ted Bundy.\n\n&gt; regarding camouflage. I think we agree it doesn't matter whether it is a conscious decision or not. I believe you are saying that you would expect psychopaths to rise to the top of society and that psychopaths are evil therefore the world elite is getting more evil. \n\nYes, this is a fair assessment of what I'm saying.\n\n&gt; Even if you grant that the world's leaders are becoming more psychopathic in order to become part of the elite they have to pretend to be prosocial. \n\nI don't like the way this is worded because a sentence ago we just admitted that camouflage was a subconscious kind of expression, but now you're saying the phrase \"has to pretend\". It could just be me narrowly worrying about semantics but this sort of performance comes naturally to me. Again to really demonstrate how I see this, I consider the following examples synonymous: \"Whales breach just by nature of being whales.\" \"Beavers build dams, by nature\" \"Psychopaths like Ted Bundy put their arms in slings to feign low threat while being stuck on the side of the road to entice a young woman to be murdered and raped.\" \n\nA lot of people would disagree with me and the last example is crucially different because they see some sort of scheming and planning and pretending, but I don't see it that way. Yes, there *is* some kind of conscious, superficial narrative in the brain, but purely as a description of what's going on I see all of these behaviors as the same phenotypic expressions. Spiders spin webs. Psychopaths naturally do not *appear* to be psychopaths. There's no huge ummm, evolutionary cost where they are deeply self-aware of how evil and malicious they are and now they need to orchestrate a very burdensome lie to not get found out-- I think that's a confusion of what's going on.\n\n&gt; As the level of scrutiny increases, they will have to behave prosocially more and more of the time. If the world's elite are forced to behave prosocially more often then how does it follow that the world is getting more evil?\n\nThere's superficial prosocial behavior, and then there's genuine prosocial behavior. It's the whole pattern that's important here to me, not the individual details. Forest, not the trees. Only looking at the trees here gets us confused. We have to understand the asymmetry between good and evil in a game theoretical context. Let's simplify it: Good and evil presuppose ethics, and ethics are a set of rules. Evil is uniquely positioned in a way that it isn't constrained by really *any* rules, if you think about it. Truly **anything** goes, just \"win\". Good, however, has to be constrained by rules, in order to be good, no matter what your ethics are-- this is why this idea is truly flexible, you can plug in virtually anything you want, virtue ethics, deontology, utilitarianism, whatever. \n\nSo for instance being a philanthropist mega-billionaire who has opened up children's centers for underprivileged children all over the developing world, and really getting a lot of good done is perfectly compatible with also having a giant sex dungeon complex under one's mansions where one rapes and tortures children, if one is evil. If one is good, this strategy is just not an option. You can only do that first part, and not only that, you must do it genuinely. To speak of \"Silver linings\" here is fail to address what actually matters: motives, intentions, big-picture consequences\/\"winning\"(Yes, children get help in a superficial sense-- but the world becomes a fucking hellscape and power organizes itself quite specifically-- the children's philanthropy becomes like a bone thrown to dogs, or a cool summer shade that hides Satan himself. It's not *meaningful*.). \n\nIt's also not the same if this philanthropy is done because one is just a total narcissist who jerks themselves off to the thought of being a benevolent talented hero on the world stage(I say this as apolitically as possible as a description of narcissism, but think \"Trump Daycare industries\": \"It's gonna YUGE. TREMENDOUS!\"). And it's *certainly* not the same if it just shelters your child torture endeavors. Good is very *narrow* as strategic expression(this is compatible with gradations of good\/evil-- the generic narcissist philanthropist is certainly less evil than the child torture philanthropist), while evil has virtually every move available other than the truly benevolent and genuine moves. When you iterate this situation and run the simulation long enough, all else being equal, the \"Characters\" with more strategic moves available will reliably win. It's simply like flipping a coin that is rigged long enough.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631804034,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hd334wd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pnkhoa","locked":false,"name":"t1_hd334wd","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_hd2g59i","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/pnkhoa\/someone_has_to_get_hurt_occasionally\/hd334wd\/","retrieved_on":1650149489,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I'd say something like \"Evil is rhyzomatic\" or \"Evil is crystallizing\" on top of being everywhere. But anyway, I don't think evil in the Witch trials was as different as you claim. A lot of the fundamental elements of ethical norms had to be operative then, and therefore also the presupposition of their opposites. They're operative in *monkeys* for crying out loud. Ethical intuitions around fairness, justice, harm, cruelty, etc are ingrained in many mammals, and it's insane to think this was not operative a few hundred years ago just because people were superstitious lunatics. So evil is not some brittle thing in spite of the fact that people could be confused about what is evil or what isn't.

The advantage could be anything. Make one a centimetre taller without any disadvantages and that the taller clone will win.\n\nOhh okay, now it's clear. Yes, I knew that, I guess what I'm trying to say is that psychopathy is an advantage there, but I may have conflated that with \"psychopathy is the *greatest* advantage\" somewhere(something I also believe is true). Many people would dispute that psychopathy is advantage, and see it as a bug, not a feature. All I want to do is dispute the degree to which people believe it's a bug to get a re-evaluation going. I don't expect to prove psychopathy is the end-all be-all strategy with that argument alone.\n\n&gt; Zooming out, if being a psychopath was so beneficial how can there be any non psychopaths left in the gene pool. Why haven't we all been out-competed? There must be a flaw in your logic or the world would look different.\n\nI think the black and white or categorical thinking here in our academic terms\/concepts leads us astray. I don't think there's such a thing as \" a psychopath \"(It's useful to have it as an abstraction to distinguish between someone like Ted Bundy or a pacifist monk), but rather everyone appears on a psychopathic gradient. It's the same as pattern recognition-- we're all *slightly* schizophrenic, because the same phenotype that becomes pathological in schizophrenics had some kind of adaptive value. We are pattern seeking. When that pattern seeking becomes pathological, we call that schizophrenia or similar. The same is true with psychopathy. We're descended from a meat grinder and planetary torture dungeon of rapists and murderers and liars. That's \"what won\", historically, to one degree or another. To speak of altruism in this context is to make the silver lining mistake I pointed out earlier, by the way. Superficial evil as a function of arbitrary genetic expressions really is meaningfully evil, where as superficial good as a function of arbitrary genetic expressions isn't *that* good. They are asymmetrical, and this is unintuitive, because people just *expect* symmetry here as a result of cultural ideas we've been raised on around good\/evil.\n\nAlong that psychopathic gradient were the losers in the set of winners. These descendants will be less psychopathic(which could just mean they're sociopathic-- I'm not painting some picture where evil scales in a straightforward way with socioeconomic class or something like that-- I distinguish sociopathy as overt evil, while psychopathy is covert evil). Outliers also exist-- so I'm not saying a decent human being becoming a billionaire is *impossible*, either. Everyone serves a purpose because humanity is quite hive-like. It's the same reason why we haven't \"out-competed\" [cows](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FMepy_THcOg?t=13) to extend this to an inter-species view. It's just not *useful* to do so, out-competing is the wrong way to think about it. It's about **who** benefits. Altruism is non-zero sum because good people benefit, but evil people also benefit-- it becomes the framework for their mask, which is crucial to get evil off of the ground. Otherwise evil would just get ganged up on once people recognized something like:\n\n \"Holy shit... this person\/thing is *insane*-- and worse than that. Whatever the word 'bad' means this person is the most extreme form of that! ...everyone just... loses, even this person-- they're just not oriented to realize it. All we need to do is get rid of this evil person and things will get solved\". \n\nBut due to the existence of altruism and the selection pressure of camouflage and deception in general, this problem actually *can't* ever be solved. The second law of thermodynamics helps here, so I'd argue the very substrate of the universe, physics, gives evil an edge. It's so much easier to spread a lie than undo the damage of the lie. It's so much easier to burn a hard working person's house down than to rebuild the house. Things just *naturally* break down, so when evil sits at the top of the pyramid, it takes a lot of work to climb up that pyramid to fight evil. You have to work hard to build a ladder, but all it needs to do is set fire to it. Or kick you off with one foot while lounging around on the throne at the apex, with plenty of time left over to plan the next 100 moves in advance. Just imagine how many \"chess players\", metaphorically speaking, are playing power games right now on Earth, and planning moves in advance. You can't actually beat that. It's a rigged game here.\n\n&gt; You have called Elon Musk and Bill Clinton psychopaths and have called psycopaths evil. They both have large amounts of influence, power and money. What have they done that is evil? How have they made the world worse? I don't think they have to any significant degree.\n\nI don't think I called Clinton a psychopath but yes, I'd agree that the odds are good he has meaningfully psychopathic traits. Musk as well. I don't think about it in strictly pragmatic terms, I'm not approaching this in some kind of bottom-up sense-- so I'm not going to give you some kind of legal analysis of how they're evil, I don't have that kind of data. I'm simply looking at reality, looking at [what wins in very broad terms](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=185), I'm looking at [what is possible given enough selection pressure and time](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv), and I see that the overall pattern for power involves psychopathic traits, both in a [Western context](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KLpM0bo.jpeg), and in an [Eastern context](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/). This are simply observations of the human species. From this big picture, I work top down and make assumptions about what is likely to be the case with figures of power\/success. Over in a highly pragmatic \"rationalist\" space like this one, this will be taboo, but only because there's a bias against idealism here and a bias towards pragmatism, but that's another debate on epistemology.\n\nI think we've already covered that what I'm saying is likely not falsifiable, it's *roughly* something like Dark Matter, but even worse than that-- because there's a chance we can get direct access to Dark Matter in the future. The odds aren't as good for psychopathic dominance. It's hard to see now, it will be almost impossible\/impossible to see later, but if one grants the right ideas, they can predict the existence of it.\n\nPart of why it's so hard, by the way, is because this is one of the least attractive ideas one could possibly take seriously. Most people on Earth have too much to lose, even if this is true. Given what we know about psychology, most people will argue their way around this idea somehow. People have families, careers, sunk costs, etc. The psychological cost of taking on \"Our world is hopelessly dominated by dystopian-tier psychopathic overlords\" is rather high-- the fact that the idea is so maladaptive makes arguing for it challenging.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1631810466,"distinguished":null,"edited":1631810820.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hd3j433","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pnkhoa","locked":false,"name":"t1_hd3j433","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_hd379g1","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/pnkhoa\/someone_has_to_get_hurt_occasionally\/hd3j433\/","retrieved_on":1650148143,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

This is a semantic debate about what \"bad\" means-- whether bad means bad in practice, or bad in principle, etc. If psychopathy is only getting more powerful, if egos are like black holes whose mass is getting larger, if technology allows for more and more sinister behavior, and total hierarchical subjugation only gets more, rather than less, feasible, then that's simply things getting worse-- it just hasn't become lucid yet, in the same way the horrific potential of something like the holocaust was simply unimaginable to most people in 1920.

Compare it to the phenotype of psychopathy(again, informally, just off the top of your head-- I am not the sort of person who cares about authority, who appeals to something like the DSM-- I have a \"The lunatics run the asylum\" sort of attitude, so it's really up to philosophers here more than psychiatrists to tell us what psychopathy is):\n\n* Callous\n* Self-absorbed\n* Domineering\n* Self-aggrandizing\n* Sadomasochistic\n* Fearless\n* Low aversion to risk\n* Charming\n* Deceptive\n* Manipulative\n\nand so on...\n\nSo you just go down the list. The closer your fictional\/horror character matches this trait expression, the more meaningfully evil they are. This is how I'm viewing things.\n\n&gt; There's a lot of narcissism. Perhaps surprisingly, narcissism is actually about a collapse of the actual ego. Its roots are probably in the general anomie and atomism.\n\n&gt; Healthy people have pretty strong egos, but that's not really what we mean. \n\nI think that's actually a part of the psychopathic culture I'm describing. I don't think ego is generally healthy, or leads to ethical progress. Ego is that \"me me me\" drive-- it's inherently anti-social, even if your scheme of \"me me me\" involves \"group  group group\", it's always reducible to \"me me me\". \"group group group\" is just a *trick* or a superficial surface layer, where the real value orientation under it is \"me me me\". Jeff Bezos will simply eat your liver when push comes to shove, and plenty of human apologists would say he has a \"healthy ego\" due to being one of the most successful businessmen in human history.

You either admit this is a hellscape and its time to hit the breaks, or you don't. You've doubled down already on this all being \"worth it\".\n\nI'm guessing there's actually nothing other than your own ego being threatened that would give you pause here if history alone hasn't given you pause. Onward to progress, right? Onward to 1 trillion humans and exponential guaranteed suffering in a hierarchical pyramid-- even **more** favelas to help! Just think, an entire **galaxy** of favelas-- the charity work will never need to end. Just think about how many new child rape victims there will be to counsel? Can't avoid breaking a few eggs to make an omelette though.\n\nNone of this will register, of course, because when the ego reaches that level of pathology anything that puts into question the hero narrative just briefly enters orbit and gets slingshotted out again. The only way the ego will ever face reality is when some mass too great to ignore actually puts the ego in danger-- that's when reality will crystallize for the first time in one's life. This wouldn't be necessary if there was some actual empathy when looking at any single case of injustice on this planet and the question, \"Is this worth my self-congratulation?\" was asked. Since this doesn't seem to be operative, you'll just have to wait for your turn at the wheel of misfortune-- which will come eventually, since everyone dies.\n\nThe moment the psychopath subdues you and flares up the blowtorch for the very first time, and the hellish nature of reality sets in, only then will you realize how smug you sound. Remember-- your resume makes it all worth it. A child has been raped during the course of our conversation, but that's worth it according to you. This world isn't a hell-- such ideas are *merely* childish and sophomoric. The fact that power does whatever it wants, and power is evil and egocentric, is solvable-- and the solution is simply going forward, expanding, creating even more humongous power disparities, colossally incomprehensible structures of evil and technological sophistication, and cosmic levels of potential for sentient torture.

This is not the sophisticated philosophical position you seem to think it is, but actually a red flag. The fact that you feel personally attacked despite the absence of any direct personal attack is... interesting(Especially since you're the one calling what I'm doing trashy, immature, etc).

Your prescription appears to be to keep breeding, keep populating, keep pretending like evil isn't distilled in more and more sophisticated ways as this show goes on.

It'll torture infinite infinities of infinitely large, infinitely sentient things, over putting a bullet in its brain and finding out what happens when its time to flick the \"off\" switch.

But these people are never narcissists, from my experience.\n\n Narcissists virtually never say \"I'm a narcissist\", it's almost antithetical to severe pathological egomania and self-importance. Narcissists are selfless heroes in their own eyes. No self-awareness, no way to \"look in the mirror\".\n\nYou do however sound like you're just suffering from some kind of prisoner's dilemma where you want genuine human contact but you've probably been exposed to enough bullshit in the world that you know being vulnerable just isn't a safe strategy, so the general strategy is to avoid and push away at all costs. Coupled with the fact that humans deeply need connection, this dichotomy ends up torturing you.\n\nThe beginning of the solution is to just let go of the ego and grant that everyone is ultimately suffering this same problem. Just accept that this is how the world is. It's by resisting this and expecting some kind of fairy tale social interaction that people end up setting themselves up for failure. Once you accept it, a lot of that suffering can disappear-- because it'll no longer make sense to suffer about something no one has control over. It's like suffering because I don't have a magical unicorn that grants wishes-- yes, it's bad that I don't have that but... it's impossible anyway, so why should I suffer and beat myself up over it?","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1632064299,"distinguished":null,"edited":1632157819.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hdgynhk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pqke9u","locked":false,"name":"t1_hdgynhk","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pqke9u","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/pqke9u\/argh_the_schizoid_dilemma\/hdgynhk\/","retrieved_on":1650108472,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

The reason why I think so many people ascribe therapeutic value to this drug is the way it changes one's perception of reality by messing with two key perceptions: short term memory, and pattern recognition.\n\nAs I understand it, weed sends dopamine up(indirectly?-- unsure of the exact mechanics, so correct me if I'm wrong), and this is what triggers the feeling of epiphany you get-- it turns patternicity up. You see meaningful patterns everywhere, and since the brain gets this 'MEANING MEANING MEANING' message, that is inherently euphoric in general with one exception: When it's *negative* in meaning-- which is when marijuana causes psychosis and paranoia. But it's through dopamine that you're able to have weed, watch a bad tvshow\/movie, and find it deeply rewarding or entertaining. Or look at some ordinary object, and just laugh hysterically at some whimsical idea it induces. Or think of something you think is sheer genius that you're ecstatic about, write it down, and then later when sober discover it's total nonsense.\n\nParkinson's drugs are also based on dopamine and dopamine precursors, which is why psychosis is a common side-effect in these drugs. To further connect the dots-- Parkinson's patients often find marijuana to have therapeutic value-- and this is because... dun dun dunnnnn: Parkinson's is due to low levels of dopamine when the cells that produce dopamine die(or are impaired? Not an expert, so correct me if I'm wrong). You can find videos of people with Parkinson's who are trembling from tremors, have some weed(perhaps a specific strain is needed, dunno), and then the tremors subside with the onset of the drug. Pretty amazing to see. (Edit: [found it](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zNT8Zo_sfwo))\n\nOkay so that tangent aside, the second part is memory-- specifically short term memory. Marijuana makes it so you have the attention span of a squirrel-- you just don't pay very good attention to anything for long, the next stimulus captivates your mind pretty much immediately. This combined with the high patternicity from the dopamine means you're basically playing the slot machine constantly on the next experience, and whatever experience arrives doesn't last for long. Now, if you've had a super traumatic life or just a deeply unrewarding life, then this not only promises to interrupt the persistent memory of this experience, but also constantly provide a random, novel experience. To a trauma victim or sufferer of some psychological condition this will potentially have some value.\n\nThe problem is when you use this long term, you begin to condition your brain towards this patternicity and it can become pathological. I also suspect memory is impaired long term but the problem with studies about marijuana is the science is just all over the place and often not rigorous-- really hard to find anything conclusive on this drug given how many variables you have to control for. It's not like \"aspirin\", which by comparison would be really easy to do science on.\n\nSo yeah, you're right that it's not a silver bullet OP, but it can have value, and it's often stigmatized as something you should feel guilty about. I would disregard that stigma as long as you're being responsible. If it's a big help to you, then it sounds like you found something that works-- just consider moderation.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1632233001,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hdpw498","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_psaz93","locked":false,"name":"t1_hdpw498","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_psaz93","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/psaz93\/does_anybody_smoke_weed_to_take_the_edge_off\/hdpw498\/","retrieved_on":1650078272,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I am not arguing in this piece that there is no free will, though I made no effort to assuage free will believers that their views are still compatible with my arguments, so I can understand your impressions. At the end of the day, we all make choices, **we all have the capacity to improve our lives.**\n\nThe article is not written in a way as if there is *only* luck, but rather a whole lot of luck-- which is simply the fact of reality. There are semantics around the word \"luck\" like there are around the word \"free will\"-- **ultimately** there's zero freedom because of course, you author absolutely nothing about you, you're an expression of a soup. But in narrow terms, it's useful to use the word free in instances where you aren't in handcuffs or being coerced, vs instances where you are. Part of the confusion is people interchangeably use these different semantic meanings and everyone's running on different definitions-- making for a conversation where people talk past each other.\n\nSo in the **ultimate** sense, yes, it's just luck because you need to get lucky to be in a position to be the sort of person who overcomes obstacles. Sufficient bad luck removes you from the running here, just like sufficiently good luck can transform even profoundly unlucky lives(Like being the cancer patient who gets accepted for the bone marrow transplanet vs. being the countless cancer patients who die waiting for one).\n\n You can't account for the fact that you're born some dude who is reasonably well off in the 1st world, and not an armless beggar in the slums of Bangladesh. You can't account for the fact that you didn't get parents and a brain that would result in your being crippled psychologically in a way that resists all treatment. You can't account for the fact that life has yet not been so unbearable for you that you consider it an **urgent certainty** to commit suicide as quickly as humanly possible. The moment those conditions manifest in your brain, I'm not sure if you realize, but that's **it**-- you will be committing suicide, no matter how hard you exercise whatever magical free will exists. Once your neurology manifests the certainty of death and the unbearable nature of life in a way that resists **all intervention** like some people on this planet experience, then you're simply donezo-- and it's through no fault of your own, but rather, luck.\n\n\nThose are all simple happenstances. So while yes, improvement is possible(because choices are possible, and we have to admit that some choices are bad-- like taking a hammer to our ankles until a fine paste remains, and other choices are good-- exploring and training in the skills we think are most fruitful to getting a better life and making life better for others), improvement is contingent on the luck to find oneself in a state where improvement is actionable. I don't mean in principle, but in the **practice** of physics, neurons, and so on. Some people pretend as if this is not the case, which causes a lot of confusion and harm, because it blames victims of misfortune into not \"pulling themselves up by their bootstraps\" hard enough, or justifies punishing people who were already superbly unlucky to begin with, like the children who were sexually, physically, and psychologically abused for the first decade or two of their lives, only to turn into serial killers. What explains this mysterious resistance?\n\nEgocentrism. Narcissism. A need to feel to proud. It's almost exclusively people who are self-absorbed and need to cling to some sense of \"me-ness\", or \"I-earned-it-fair-and-square\"-ness. So they invent a fantasy idea(free will) to scaffold this ludicrous egocentrism, which then serves a dual purpose in being a vehicle of abuse and shame to anyone who \"didn't make it\". Pride becomes a total fairy tale once free will leaves the picture, and there are some proud, fart-sniffing motherfuckers out there who will defend free will(which is really a defense of their pride) until death finally slaps around that ego to show them how utterly futile their fantasy narrative they call their \"self\" is(Notice, by the way, that free will often goes hand in hand with religiosity, which tells them that death is not the end?

All of your life you were taught either that things are a certain way, or things *should be* a certain way. Those were all not true.\n\nIt's like being locked in a cage while sadists pour gasoline over you and slowly prepare to set you on fire. How do you cope? Well, you can scream in panic and claw at the steel bars and bang your head against them over and over, but surely that's a) pointless and b) probably going to make things worse. There's probably better moves than that. Maybe there's even a solution? Who knows. Maybe some combination of words in the right language will stop your misfortune. Maybe not. But I don't see any value in \"coping\" or its presupposition(things **are** different\/we expect things to be different). This is reality, it's all we have, and it's all anything could be. The more interesting thing is looking at 'why'? Why is this the way it is? Why and how are the mechanics of things arranged in such a way that causes badness?\n\nAre there better ways to deal with this badness, and worse ways? Surely the answer is objectively: Yes. We could \"cope\" sure, but is that really the right move? To obscure the badness or forget or to eat steak in the Matrix? A lot of people seem to like this idea, but I don't. If you examine those mechanics of badness, eventually you'll arrive at the ego. The thing that wants to cope, the thing that wants anything or doesn't want anything. The voice going, \"Me me me me me\". Reduce that thing, and badness reduces, one way or another. It reduces both the badness you cause, because you're less of a self-concerned thing clawing at the bars and trampling over others just to get a tiny chance of escaping, and it reduces the badness that comes to you-- because if there's less ego, there is less of someone to harm.\n\nOne of the same reasons why the world is a bad place( self-absorbed people engineering the world to benefit few and harm many), applies to why we experience the world as bad: we are self-absorbed things with wants and not-wants.\n\n&gt; Any hope at all?\n\nSure, hope is fine. It's just a wish for a positive outcome. Only a masochist doesn't have hope, or someone suffering some kind of severe anxiety disorder that prevents them even from hope because they're so terrified of having their hopes not resolve. Have hope, and accept when hopes don't come. Perfectly rational and compatible with pessimism.\n\n&gt; Buddha never said life has no pleasure, But, he sure said that pleasures pass away, which is pain, and pain passes away (i.e. sickness), which is pleasure. So, neither is what it appears to be ... How absurd?\n\nBut that's just the nature of things if you look closely. Pay attention next time you have a pain or a pleasure. It is simply not lasting. It **will** pass, every single time, the moment you look at it very carefully and persistently without any judgement.\n\n&gt; What is your honest advice?\n\nProbably to [train the mind](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/p0il9c\/has_anyone_been_able_to_get_off_the_hedonic\/h88jf2h\/) because that's what has the best chance of reducing the ego and therefore reducing the suffering you cause, and the suffering you experience.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1633030197,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hevypss","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pvxv0c","locked":false,"name":"t1_hevypss","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pvxv0c","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/pvxv0c\/need_advice_what_should_i_young_pessimist_make_of\/hevypss\/","retrieved_on":1647722810,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}
