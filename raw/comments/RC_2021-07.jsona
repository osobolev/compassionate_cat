I'm assuming you're asking about *eating* wild meat, right? And you're entertaining the idea that an Efilist, because they support life, could act in a promortalist way to .... what? Kill an animal in the wild and then eat it? I'd be skeptical of this because it just seems so bizarre. If one is already vegan in this promortalist(of wild animals) scenario, what's the point of the specific dietary action of eating this animal you personally killed? We don't know for sure how certain actions influence reality in the totality of scope and scale. We have *intuitions*, like a common efilist+promortalist intuition would read like this:\n\n&gt; \"Killing this pregnant deer will reduce suffering because now this deer will no longer suffer herself, and not only will her offspring not suffer, they too will not branch out into offspring of their own.\n\nAnd that's where the thinking ends. And here's exactly where you can see the limitations of the average human being. We're not **good** at thinking big, we're bad at it. We're not good at thinking logically, or rationally, we're **bad** at it. You have to almost take on that realization to a kind of religious sanctity before you can even begin to *hope* to think clearly on any topic. Why it can easily be wrong:\n\nIt's true that the suffering of those narrow chains of causal living creatures will end if you kill them(unless we fundamentally misunderstand something about consciousness and suffering). But what's unclear is the chain reactions upon the rest of causality involving suffering. Populations rise and fall in unintuitive ways. One can sustain certain populations via killing and producing adaptations. One can also cause a completely unexpected rebound by trying to kill certain populations. This is most obvious with bacteria, where applying the hand sanitizer that \"kills 99.9% of germs and bacteria\" actually not only fails to kill the bacteria in a meaningful way, it also *reliably* and hilariously **increases** conscious misery via engineering \"super bugs\". This is how badly we are oriented to understanding the long term, or understanding complex evolutionary causal mechanisms. And this is the **easy** example. Once you get more complex and tread even deeper into areas we're utterly ignorant of, it's even harder.\n\nAnd this is where our emotions come up. This is how the monkey brain works. The monkey brain here, doesn't approach reality, process it rationally, logically, ethically, and so on, and then comes up with a conclusion that's correct. The monkey brain **first** has a narrative that fits its own evolutionary game, utterly unaware to itself. So it can be an Efilist for example, or a vegan, or an antinatalist, and then the belief system is mapped **over** this as a narrative. As a story. It feels like it's reached through logic, facts, good reasons, etc-- but it's rather just an utterly comforting story. Then when new facts enter the picture that conflict with the narrative, the narrative is defended at all costs. This is why people don't change their minds, hardly ever. They take on an ideology or a belief, and then it generally doesn't budge. Even when it's *proven* to us that we were wrong, like there was a study I heard an anecdote about recently where some people were told a story about a warehouse fire caused by the chemicals or oil spills, and one group in this study was then later told a correction that said \"It actually turned out that there was no chemical or oil spill\", people in that second group **still** had a significant sample of things to say like \"Well they were just irresponsible leaving those chemicals around like that\".\n\nSo it would just be strange to me to hear a vegan efilist promortalist going out into the wild to kill deer for instance and then eat them. I consider veganism, in the dietary sense, more so to do with disgust and social signalling than about making meaningful ethical impacts. So it's really hard to imagine a vegan who *wasn't* suffering from some kind of cognitive dissonance, going out into the wild to do this. I think a vegan would more *reliably* cause less suffering if they went to the store and bought meat or dairy instead, than go out into the wilderness to try to painlessly kill an animal(or animals-- because why stop at one? Oh right, because the stomach can only get so full...). That's how misguided I personally think that action could easily be.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625185932,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h3qxwj1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_obxg9x","locked":false,"name":"t1_h3qxwj1","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_obxg9x","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/obxg9x\/efilism_and_veganism\/h3qxwj1\/","retrieved_on":1652756325,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

The implication here is that people who subscribe to the ideology do so because they're smart, and those who do not, are stupid. Our ideological subreddit is small, therefore, we're smart, they're dumb. I criticized this pretty harshly and mocked the attitude at the end, which was probably unnecessary, but that apparently deserves a ban.\n\nWhen I tried to sort it out with the mods, this is the ultimatum I eventually got:\n\n&gt; Another mod chipping in here.

You have also insulted the subreddit (and by proxy, those who take time out of their day to maintain it) in the process by insinuating that this subreddit is a source of hurt. And as has been pointed out, you could have taken the high road, simply reported the comment, and blocked the user.\n\n&gt; Here is how things can play out after this very comment, because everthing that could have been said has been said by this point:\n\n&gt; 1) You apologize for what you said. Clean slate via unban.\n\n&gt; 2) You don't do anything; including not replying to this comment. Fair enough; nothing changes from the current status of things.\n\n&gt; 3) You continue insisting you are in the right. You get labelled as spam which, believe me, always ends with the person on the receiving end having to block the subreddit. Let it be stated here that I gave a very fair warning. I would prefer you not force this option and would seriously suggest #2 if you're still in disagreement.\n\nAnother mod claimed that they've been \"gathering evidence\" of me mistreating people, but when I asked them to show me where I did anything wrong, it was just more accusations like \"Why are you even here? Why would you say something so awful?\" Never any evidence. Curiously, why would you \"gather evidence\" as a mod? Why wouldn't you just speak up the moment an offense is presented and say, \"Hey-- this isn't okay here, just thought I'd let you know.\" This is a *huge* red flag.\n\nOh and, the quote in question here, where I \"called someone a psychopath\"?

That being said, I think they're wrong in an undervalued way, which is, \"in principle\". The \"niches\"(problems) that \"genes or species\"(solutions) fit into are arbitrary in a way that real problems are not. \n\nWhat is true in the totally ontological sense, is simply true. We don't live in the universe where 2+2 exists as a problem and then \"4\" eventually coalesces as the best solution in principle, we live in the universe where 2+2 exists as a problem and then through the arbitrary rules of natural selection, 4 fits in(to risk stretching the analogy perhaps beyond the limits of its utility). Logic is simply logical no matter what universe we're talking about, it's not arbitrary. Where as creatures that fit into a niche, are arbitrary expressions of fitness in the most meaningful sense we can care about. There's a pragmatic way of speaking here, of course. Like so:\n\nIf a Lion evolves with laser eyes and a newt-like regenerative ability and telepathy and flight and the ability to stay underwater for 2 weeks without surfacing for oxygen and diamond claws(And so on, and so on), but they're competing in a niche against regular lions who trivially have a genetic difference around pathogen resistance, causing the God-lion population to get wiped out over time, then pragmatists have to double down here and say \"Whelp, looks like the regular ol' lions are *simply* the highly adapted creature!\" \n\nThen consider: Suppose the God-lions aren't wiped out. Suppose that a mating pair survive, at a critical point of extinction, after the pathogen had been wiped out due to some further genetic strangeness that instead wiped out the God-lion killing pathogen. Finally, the God-lions could repopulate! But... some lightning struck a big ol' rock and killed one of the two God-lions while they were asleep in their habitat. Whoops, but... hey! Guess they just *weren't* adapted, right? It's *true* that they weren't adapted in *practice*, but this gets you these really absurd, really superficial representations of what \"adapted\" means. We're forced to only care about reality in *this* sense, as if *this* is the only thing that's \"real\". I dispute this, and care more about that *other* sense of what \"adapted\" means. That God-lion really *is* adapted in my view, and in a much more meaningful way than what a pragmatic representation can offer, but we're biased in a way that struggles to recognize it due to personal and even cultural values that favor pragmatism over idealism.\n\n\nI don't think there's an absurd enough disparity one could paint here to make someone who is hard-committed to a purely pragmatic representation of reality see the exact problem, but to simply try anyway, I'm saying that the \"adapted species\" we see who thrive in certain niches, do so in superficial terms, via superficial happenstances that don't **truly** express adaptation, because they **only** express adaptation in *practice*, something much less valuable than adaptation in principle.\n\nAgain, purely a values tension here philosophically, idealism vs. pragmatism, and this idea won't be well received by really any science-minded, rationality-minded, and so on, type of person, but I think it's worth pointing out because while I think it's hard to see for most people, I do think it's true.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625234916,"distinguished":null,"edited":1625236340.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h3t16gn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o2tl8b","locked":false,"name":"t1_h3t16gn","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h2ayd02","permalink":"\/r\/seancarroll\/comments\/o2tl8b\/there_is_no_monolithic_purpose_of_life\/h3t16gn\/","retrieved_on":1652751863,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"seancarroll","subreddit_id":"t5_i0nkv","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/seancarroll","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Moral progress is a kind of bone thrown to the bottom of power hierarchies, which is a way of saying \"You can have your more ethical world now, because we have such a grip on things that we don't need to *literally* enslave you as ambitiously as before.\", or something similar to this. In a world where our free speech would be a dire threat to say, first world governments and intelligence organizations, and millitaries, we would *simply* have no free speech, because they have the power.\n\nIt's not like ethics is a total mystery-- people know what right and wrong is in very simple cases(unless you're a little on the spectrum and think ethics is a matter of calculating arbitrary values) and this is because even lower primates can express ethical ideas to each other(of course, lower primates can also be complete sociopaths, but this isn't a symmetrical counterpoint, I don't think, because one can say that a baboon for instance, is clueless when it comes to ethics, where as someone performing a genocide, isn't, in anywhere near the same way). They're oriented to be deeply anti-social and unethical and express their power, as a function of their trait-set(but they *know* what they're doing is wrong, they can simply afford to not care). I will lose many people here when I say \"ethics is pretty obvious\", -- the sort of person who can't admit torturing a child with a blowtorch \"for fun\" is not just wrong, but *really* wrong, will struggle here, in which case, this post really isn't written towards such a person(tangent: The conception of \"meta-ethics\" in academia are simply pro-power memes-- ambiguous ethics benefit power structures, but not the bottoms of hierarchies. In short, almost all of our smart people are confused because power is the beneficiary of most people being confused about right and wrong-- \"ethics\", and being unethical is a feature of power-expression.). \n\nPower is what dictates if you can perform a genocide in the first place. Or enslave people. Or subject people to propaganda. Or torture animals by the hundreds of billions. Or create social conditions that basically fuck the poor relentlessly until the end of time. Or support standards or ideas that are clearly unfair. These are all expressions of power, and then over this power, which occurs fundamentally, we then map our memes and stories and narratives. It's not that there's a way the world is, and it's as we see it, because we see the world well, but rather, power impinges on reality(fundamentally in the identical [way it does in nature](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=200), but with less overt misery or clear victim\/offenders), which then dictates a narrative, forces a game state, and then the narrative gets mapped over that, depending on what position you are as a player in this game. If you're a \"big winner\", the narrative will favor you, it will be utterly self-serving. You'll be optimistic, stoic, see not *too much* wrong, and think people are generally freaking out. If you're a \"big loser\", then you'll see moral failure all over the place. As usual, outliers exist. Some of your observations will be wrong, of course, because there's no special enlightened position in being a victim of oppression(just like being ontop of the world is no special seat of enlightenment either, because it suffers from the same egocentric predicament), but some places you'll be right for good reasons, or right by accident(by accident is the common way people are right about ethics), in a way that power either is ignorant to, or simply doesn't care about. That's simply the sort of thing power affords.\n\nPower is what affords moral progress.

I have no idea what this means. How would we *not* do this. Whatever we do in this endeavor, is by definition, our will, in practice. Intentionally *not* preserving our will would be a function of our will. To paraphrase that supposed Schopenhauer quote: \"You can do what you want, but you can’t want what you want.\"\n\n&gt; As you’ve mentioned, we’re all tainted with some psychopathy, but I feel that’s not all that we are.\n\nThat's true, it's not all that we are, but it's the core driver for power\/domination, and it dictates pretty much everything. There is no escape from a constantly distilling evil and obscuring of truth. Every bit of progress forward is far more movement backwards, in terms of new, hidden power\/evil\/camouflage, for which the next generations may or may not realize, and if they ever solve, result in even greater hidden power\/evil, which is of course, even *more* camouflaged.\n\n&gt; To save the world, in a sense, means making sure it stays burning, but also that it does not get too hot. Survival is a careful balance between ice and fire.\n\nIt could be true. It may be the case that the \"repugnant conclusion\" of the human predicament is that suffering must go on. But this is the status quo idea. This is the idea our egocentric species takes for granted, from every billionaire, to every middle-of-the-pyramid inhabitant, to even the majority of the bottom of the human pyramid that suffers the hardest.

Otherwise why cede moral progress to them? \n\nYes, you're right, in the sense that cattle are an important commodity to the farmer. It's just that humans cause more trouble when mistreated, which is why powerful humans and weak cattle have a [slightly different relationship](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg) than powerful humans and weak humans.\n\n&gt; At the very least, people have power like the rocks above the struts in a mine have the power to fall and disrupt the mine. That's why there's struts. But what if those rocks were organic beings, and mining a practice so ancient that mines had become an ecological feature? There'd be a tidy ecological niche there for the rocklings who could extract some kind of quid pro quo from a mine. Like, say, a rockling that would thwart the struts somehow under dark conditions, but would be benign if exposed to light. I'm saying opportunity attracts the opportunist. Even if people are only a commodity of power, the opportunity for people to wrest control of the power they represent will always be there. And because the opportunity exists, we should at least half-expect the opportunist to already be there filling the niche. A MLK can exist, so he does. And it's not just about the individuals, either. Collectively, people have an opportunity to harness their own power. So in our social theory, we should anticipate a finding that they somehow capitalise on that opportunity. That's how I see it.\n\nI'm not a fan of this analogy, but I'm open to it being true. It's certainly optimistic, but the problem with this analogy when it reaches the human level is \"the mine\" represents something like social stability(notice due to values asymmetry that power doesn't care about maintaining social stability if it means gaining or keeping power, but ethical agents actually need to consider whether or not disrupting something like social stability is the right move-- this is the imbalance of good, which is constrained by many rules, and evil, which is largely unconstrained), and thwarting the struts I see as a kind of selection pressure applied to evil, powerful beings. In the short term, it's *conceivable* that some mines could collapse, killing the miner-- but the more mines you collapse, the stronger you make struts in applying selection pressure, and the more collapse-resistant miners you make. This is essentially why I'm not so optimistic, I essentially believe evil and power(synonymous to me, more or less) distills with time. An MLK can exist, but he's at a disadvantage due to the entropic process I described in a way that power is not. It's easier to assassinate an MLK, than to create one, from the perspectives of the tops\/bottoms of the hierarchy. Entropy means power+evil always has the edge, and evolution\/natural selection ensures that every attempt to weaken miners or collapse mines, paradoxically, makes them stronger.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625372256,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h3zoukj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ocjy9m","locked":false,"name":"t1_h3zoukj","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h3yrs1o","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/ocjy9m\/does_moral_philosophy_drive_moral_progress\/h3zoukj\/","retrieved_on":1652737634,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Mindfulness is an antidote to things like the suffering caused by psychosis, or intrusive thought, or other neuroses.\n\nTo clarify, it is possible to see thoughts as distinct. The alternative to this is *living* through your thoughts, feeling like you **are** your thoughts. But this can't be-- how can **you** be something that you're simply watching? Think back to a time you were strongly possessed by negative emotion, like anger, or fear, or worry, or anything. It was as if nothing could snap you out of it, right? But now imagine what would happen if all of a sudden, in the midst of this terrible few minutes, or terrible hour, or few hour ordeal, something *interrupted* this process. Suppose you got a phone call with some very unexpected, very positive news. A relative you didn't know passed away, and it turns out you've inherited a large sum of money. Well... that certainly changes this, doesn't it? I don't mean your life circumstances, I'm referring to the *sudden* change in your mind. You were suffering deeply psychologically, and in a split second, things just *change*. How could that be? Think about how odd that process is. As if by magic, we're moved through these thoughts, and we *feel* like there's something about them that makes these thoughts a deeply connected part of our identity, but this isn't true if you simply pay careful attention. If you pay careful attention you'll see that thoughts are more like clouds slowly passing by in the sky. Or a brief scent in the breeze. Scents or visuals are not \"you\", you're just *watching* or *smelling* these things.

Notice how this sounds with any other ideology:\n\n* Christians - \"How do we make Christianity viral?\"\n* Marxismm - \"How do we make Marxism viral?\"\n* Pacifism - \"How do we make pacifism viral?\"\n\nand so on.\n\nNow, maybe I'm just unlucky and there's a Christian Marxist Pacifist reading this who goes, \"What's your point? That would be great!\" but other than that, doesn't this seem strange? It says, \"Look, we've *figured* things out. We're human beings in the abitrary year 2021, and the debate is now over. Now is the time to put our views into **action**.\"\n\nUsually the only defense someone has at this point is:\n\n\"Okay well Christians are delusional, but Efilists aren't! Efilists are uniquely enlightened!\" And *this* is when one's ideological commitment should worry them-- because this is how all cults sound. If you're in a cult, and point something like this out, you **will** be removed from the group promptly. Cults don't care about discussions-- they've *already* figured things out. When you're doing philosophy, it means you're committed to honesty, truth, learning, and so on. If there's something *really there* to Efilism, then it's far better to just commit to discussion, examining all the nuance, looking for errors, looking all every possible variable and solution, it's really a life-long endeavor of asking questions, not so much producing answers. This is distinct from more straightforward ethical scenarios like arriving at the scene of someone drowning, and being able to help them due to being a skilled swimmer.

I criticize *every* popular pessimistic proactive ideology on these same terms, by the way(AN, PM, Veganism, etc).

I've written about this a few times, but I almost never encounter it. We're very absorbed in the puny scale of our own species and planet, and it amazes me that people still today have such anthropocentric\/geocentric attitudes when it comes to solving problems which seem likely to be problems of the universe, and not merely problems of Earth.\n\nThe torture chamber analogy is apt. My own version off the cuff is we're in a complex that is some sort of 'concentration camp-like' place, and we're in our own torture chamber, and we can't be sure if other torture chambers are on the premises. We know that at minimum, in *principle* we have the power to solve problems, so should we get out of our chamber and run for the woods? Or would it be ethical to also free the people in other chambers, if it turns out such chambers exist? What if their torture is far worse than ours, and rescuing them is actually achievable, or even *trivially easy*? What if we'd only waste our time doing such things? What if we'll torture ourselves or fall into some other trap by endeavoring to solve the problem? These are some of the important questions, to which I think there are objectively correct answers, both logistically, and ethically. Many disagree with that second point, especially.\n\nTo address Antinatalism specifically, the argument against unconditional antinatalism is really effortless, and it sounds like this:\n\nSuppose you had an AGI that was practically omniscient in it's ability to solve problems by calculating incomprehensible measurements of small particles and extrapolating them into real world scenarios, so for instance \"If you order a sandwich in x location at 9:00 on aa\/bb\/cccc, avoid bumping into the person entering on your way out, walk into the corner store, look left, right, up, and approach the cashier and ask to buy a lottery ticket and simply tell the person at the register the first numbers that enter your mind, you will the jackpot.\"\n\nIf we had access to such an AGI, and it informed us that having a certain child, in specific conditions, resulted in freeing a population of 1 Trillion beings being tortured on a planet in our galaxy, one would be a monster to not have such a child. Not only would the parents be moral heroes, but the child would be a hero. What would it mean, for this child to say: \"I never *asked* to be born!? How *dare* you!\" This would simply be the most narcissistic, and unethical child in the history of Earth's existence, as far as we could tell. Only a monster or someone utterly intoxicated by dogmatic ideology would not sign up for this. Even if we couldn't be sure, and we had a 90%, or 75%, or 50% success rate for this working, and if failure was the outcome then this child would simply lead an average human life by today's standards(ups and downs, nothing too [dramatically hellish](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo) ), then everything mentioned prior would still be true. This is the argument against dogmatic Antinatalism, and why I share something similar to the blogger's \"Antinatalism+ asterisks\".\n\nOne point I want to address tangentially that I think confuses us is:\n\n&gt;  Dark energy sends other planets farther from our reach every day, so eventually the dictum “ought implies can” will excuse us; we won’t be obligated to do the impossible. \n\nI've encountered this \"ought implies can\" idea before, either directly, as expressed in those very words, and fleshed out as an axiom to follow, or tacitly, in a kind of attitude or implication, and I want to really draw attention to this idea and say after thinking about it for a while I think \"ought implies can\" is really *peak* confused pragmatism. By that I mean, is it a product of a values orientation around \"what works\" or \"what we're working with\" or \"what is realistic\"( you can get the *concern* I'm trying to characterize with these quoted values), that misses the point and doesn't understand how valuable the opposite idealistic value is to contrast it. To ground this less abstractly, I recently had a conversation with someone on reddit who seemed to be operating via \"ought implies can\", you can get a feel for the two different values orientations in a conflict [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/ob7irk\/what_kind_of_efilist_are_you\/h3q2lhv\/).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625539048,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h471zwu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_odycge","locked":false,"name":"t1_h471zwu","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_odycge","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/odycge\/the_cosmic_sinking_ship_questions_on_the_value_of\/h471zwu\/","retrieved_on":1652721727,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

If there was a planet in the other side of the galaxy with humanoid beings, they could conceivably fight over who had the longer index fingers, and then the shorter index finger people and longer index finger people would all war with each other and make reality about index finger size(one tribe would probably \"win\" over the other, which would say nothing other than \"one tribe got lucky\"), when in reality, small numbers of evil beings, oriented with domination traits, would exploit these two warring tribes who are too busy fighting with each other. The real fight is the evil beings, which is why divide and conquer was such a crucial strategic concept that has been used by domination empires like Rome and ancient China, and is a meme even the average person today has heard of(but has not self-reflected deeply on).\n\n&gt; but I deal with the delusion or stuck in the mentality that there must be a way\n\nI'm deeply pessimistic and cynical but I will admit silver linings exist not out of delusional optimism but because I think it's simply the case.

I think it's probably true that no one can win in our universe ethically(evil wins in the grand scheme, in other words, if you beat evil, you **are** evil, there's no good beating evil hollywood bullshit in our world), but we can still \"lose less\", so we can see losing less as a kind of winning. The way to do that? Simply strive to be as far away from evil as humanly possible(no easy feat, since all humans are oriented for evil to some degree via evolution-- you see it everywhere if you just look with care and attention, which is also very difficult to do). In other words, there are ways to move through the world that make things worse: Bad strategy number 145: Run around with bats and assault anyone you meet. Not opting for this strategy, means losing less. Where else can we lose less? It's very hard to answer once we get to more complex ideas(don't assault people with bats is a simple idea), because our \"good ideas\" or our \"solutions\" are often really just ways of further paving the road to hell, and not even with good intentions, but often with bad intentions which we're too ideologically blinded to even recognize.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625593040,"distinguished":null,"edited":1625593818.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h49d0vp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oey1u8","locked":false,"name":"t1_h49d0vp","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h49btkw","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/oey1u8\/i_love_that_people_think_15_for_minimum_wage_is\/h49d0vp\/","retrieved_on":1652716713,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I think I *used* to be much less authentic at times, but in my early 20's I would read a specific book on the ethics of dishonesty over and over, and it slowly convinced me over the course of a few years to be as honest as possible, so I just stopped caring about sacrificing honesty in order to either make people happy\/not unhappy, or avoid uncomfortable situations for myself, by constantly manicuring myself for others, so things improved for me as a result. I've always had a little bit of that, because I suspect I'm somewhat on the spectrum, so I was always subtly breaking some social taboo even as a child, but eventually with enough negative stimulus here, I became very insecure and withdrawn later. That came from being *pathologically* honest, though, the way in which some people with Aspergers or Autismm sometimes are. Like answering \"how are you?\" with a *literal* account of \"how they are\". I don't do this anymore, and I think one can balance being honest to a point where you're never *lying*(insofar as that is possible for a human being), while also not constantly projecting the exact truth everywhere, no matter the cost(pathological). So I don't currently see an aversion to in-authenticity as a bad thing, I think we *should* be averse to lying. Much of the worlds problems are the way they are because we're not averse enough to telling lies to ourselves and others.\n\nI would say a bigger worry than aversion to promoting myself in-authentically has been around being misunderstood. That's another reason why committing to honesty is so good, you can reduce how often that happens to you just by striving to be honest, but you can't really be immune to this, because humans are very powerfully oriented towards huge emotional responses and huge misunderstanding, often paired with hostility or maliciousness. Acknowledging that we *will* be misunderstood often(if we're engaging with people a lot) is going to save us a lot of stress, since a big part of suffering is the surprise, or the expectation that something *shouldn't* occur, when really, we would know it does\/will occur if we just look at the world closely.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625595423,"distinguished":null,"edited":1625595652.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h49id6q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oexxch","locked":false,"name":"t1_h49id6q","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h49ffn4","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/oexxch\/the_feeling_of_never_getting_anything_for_free\/h49id6q\/","retrieved_on":1652716391,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

So for instance, we could end all life on Earth if we worry that it will proliferate throughout the galaxy and result in incomprehensible numbers of suffering beings that would make the total suffering on Earth seem trivial when compared to it, or we could invest all of our energy into repairing and sustaining life on Earth for the odd chance that incomprehensible numbers of suffering beings *already* suffer in our galaxy or somewhere accessible+salvageable by us(potentially, with sufficient technological progress), but we cannot do *both* of these things, it seems, or at least it's conceivable to imagine that it's much harder to achieve both, or perhaps impossible.\n\n&gt;However, I’m not sure if the span of outcomes is actually that much larger for future suffering compared to other cases. The possible range of casualties in a war also spans many orders of magnitude, and murder is many orders of magnitude worse than petty theft. Also, when looking at expected suffering given a world state (see above), I think it’s not clear whether this spans more than, say, 6 orders of magnitude(considering unknown s-risks etc.).\n\nAnother issue is our intuitions may be bad about understanding the relationship between petty suffering(theft, in the above analogy) to more meaningful suffering(war, in the above analogy), and maximized scope\/scale.

But notice what would happen if you were having your worst day of 2021, and what that would *feel* like(and how long it would last), when suddenly, your phone rings. It's a lawyer, and it turns out a long lost relative of yours had you in their will, and you're supposed to claim a very large sum of money.

Also if there's something genuinely unlikable about this person, you do yourself and them a disservice by lying, because they don't the signals they need(Everyone would prefer people are honest to them-- no one would want to waste time with someone not liking them).\n\nImagine if you were in their shoes, would you prefer someone who doesn't like you pretended and led you on? That would just waste your time, right? So it would make more sense to treat people fairly in a way we'd prefer to be treated.\n\n&gt; If you managed to get yourself in a long term position where you don't have to lie at all without compromising your survival, I'm jealous and would like to know how I can do that too :3\n\nSome jobs and lives really do require behaviors where not too much of the truth can get through in communication. So for example, lawyers, or undercover police officers, etc, are on the more extreme end, and there are less extreme versions as you move closer to the norm. No advice there other than I personally wouldn't want those jobs, but someone has to do them, so I have no easy answer.\n\n&gt; I'm curious, How do you manage to cooperate with humans you don't like without lying? Lets say at work for example. Or even earlier, at school. Or even just with family.\n\nYou don't have to tell someone \"I don't like you\" just to cooperate with them, if that's the case. But you also don't need to tell them \"I like you\". I'm imagining the problem here is really severely disliking someone, right? Because even in friendships, minor things probably annoy people, but these are so easy to just ignore towards some kind of superficial and trivial behavior the brain is engaged in, and can be ignored. We're talking about the hard cases where you *really* dislike a person.\n\nHere you can just recognize the person didn't choose to be the way they are, they were born into a set of genes they didn't choose, to a set of parents they didn't choose, life shaped them to be a person that one day, would be arbitrarily not liked by someone like yourself. This is simply misfortune for everyone, so you can recognize that as the focus of your attitude towards them(which is more objectively true) rather than the fact that you dislike them( more subjectively true, but not always-- some people are genuinely bad people, objectively, but the former objective truth about misfortune would still be true even if you were forced to engage with an absolute monster). This isn't easy but if you can do it, it can make these engagements like night and day.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625656570,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h4cbp6k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oexxch","locked":false,"name":"t1_h4cbp6k","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h4beoo9","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/oexxch\/the_feeling_of_never_getting_anything_for_free\/h4cbp6k\/","retrieved_on":1652710283,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

What is a \"non pragmatic\" way to think about a moral issue? \n\nSure, this is a values dichotomy that we all lean towards one way or another(not necessarily static through out our thinking), and this values smuggling can sometimes confuse us or lead us to narrow or simply mistaken representations about reality.

Some of us are so locked into pragmatic or idealistic modes that we are truly unflexible towards understanding the world any other way(in such cases, we'd call our way of seeing things \"the right way\"-- this should be a red flag that we're highly likely to be confused). This is what I'd call a pathological values orientation, once we're so oriented, that we cannot even make sense of how some other perspective could a) be viable b) be *better*. There's no easy solution for this I know of, but it's possible to dramatically shake up one's phenomenology through drugs, extreme trauma, years of introspection-- these all can widen our way of seeing the world with less rigidity.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625661395,"distinguished":null,"edited":1625662187.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h4ciiqz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_of2li2","locked":false,"name":"t1_h4ciiqz","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h4ch11y","permalink":"\/r\/TrueAntinatalists\/comments\/of2li2\/does_the_consent_argument_work\/h4ciiqz\/","retrieved_on":1652709875,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TrueAntinatalists","subreddit_id":"t5_2e4o2i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TrueAntinatalists","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

That's the more important question to me, because that tells us precisely what kind of ethics we have. A deontological Antinatalist will be forced to robotically say 100% of birth is wrong, even if the birth reliably leads to human extinction(suppose for the sake of argument, that here, it *does*). How would the average human brain rationalize this new data? It would sound something like this:\n\n&gt; \"Oh well we can't even guarantee that human extinction will occur, we can always be wrong, so giving birth to stop all future birth is absolutely insane. Also, life can just reoccur! Also, Antinatalism isn't *about* causing extinction, it's just about individual ethics!\"\n\nEtc, etc, etc. This is how nimble the human brain is in squeezing in irrational dogma into their ethical axioms. The same sort of argument could be posited to \"hard-Efilists\"(Or, Efilists who would press the big red button, or use sloppier or more brutal methods)-- Imagine if you had to create life to destabilize all life, and turn Earth into Mars. What sort of rationalizations would we see?\n\nThis is why it's important to think these questions through. We could very well be in the universe where 100% of birth is objectively wrong. Or pushing the big red button is a no-brainer. But we also may not be, even if the short-term outcomes of such a thing more or less align with ethics-- this is why ethics is not easy, it's complicated. It spreads out into a scope beyond human comprehension. We didn't evolve brains that solve these kinds of problems, we evolved to solve very simplistic problems around finding food, shelter, mates, or playing cooperation\/conflict games with other animals\/our own species. We may simply not live in the kind of universe where pressing the big red button is right. The big red button could paradoxically make things worse. The same is true for simply saying no to birth. I have no idea if it's true or not, but we should be very open to it at least *worrying* us, we only get one chance to get things right, and that's another thing that should worry us, since we know that how we think is very often guided by emotions and group signals, not by rationality. This is why we have to hard commit to finding out what is true first(at *minimum*, right?), and there right and wrong ways of doing that. Dogma, and pretending we already know things we can't know, is almost certainly the wrong way to do that.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625698518,"distinguished":null,"edited":1625698768.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h4es4eb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oewowi","locked":false,"name":"t1_h4es4eb","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_oewowi","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/oewowi\/what_are_the_arguments_against_doomsbirthism\/h4es4eb\/","retrieved_on":1652705023,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

My first reaction is to explain literally, as in, humans are involved in a scheme of domination over niches and environments and resource acquisition, etc, and therefore evolved various traits and behaviors that let us (unethically) subjugate any species we can subjugate(including ourselves).\n\n&gt; There does not seem to be a 'degree' of consciousness - you either have something inside you that experiences things, or you don't.\n\nThis is the worst case scenario, given Earth's history, and would mean the mammals and birds and fish we torture aren't along some gradient of ethical consideration but along with even insects, are equivalent to us. Believing in the brain-size consciousness\/sentience gradient may be wishful thinking, and we need to seriously consider it.\n\n&gt; It seems to me that, if you accept this logic, the most ethical thing to do would be to exterminate all non-human animal life, because animals in general (and maybe humans as well, but we can fix that through genetic engineering) seem to live very unhappy lives. A first step is to be a vegan (I'm one myself) but I'm under no delusions that what I'm doing is helping in any meaningful way. Thoughts?\n\nThat's a very rare, sober admission on your part-- most vegans aren't quite that honest with themselves and there's so much room for moralization and tribalism and purity\/disgust signalling in the culture, which is a real shame, because animals are being tortured and we're squabbling amongst each other. So I just want to commend your honesty, it's again very rare right now. The thought experiment I frequently bring up to determine if one is sane here, is I imagine living the life of the tortured cow, but being able to mentally articulate and be aware of the kinds of thoughts some of us have in our good intentions to solve animal torture. What would it mean for you, as this cow, that's kicked around and beaten, to recognize that someone out there could be so confused in their own purity and disgust, that they ask the grill operator of a Burger King to \"please wipe down the grill\" when preparing their \"Beyond Whopper\", because they wouldn't want any animal exploitation to come in contact with their food. I've seen a suicidal adolescent get bullied online in mostly vegan communities, who were clearly being the victims of abuse at home, and clearly felt unwelcome everywhere, all because animal ethics was just the more important subject at the time. This is how we can know we've lost the plot horribly, and our entire scheme is more likely centered around very crass, tribal, monkey behavior, and not \"saving the animals\".\n\n I'm not personally vegan for reasons like those(I also don't vote for similar reasons). I wish I could believe that making individual economic choices inside a supermarket actually impacted the world's problem of animal torture, but it does not seem to be the case, because then it would be an effortless move for me personally(I've been vegan\/vegetarian for a few months and tried several different diets-- while veganism made me feel lethargic, it's not even a second thought to me if I knew it made any difference at all). \n\nSo I worry this is another one of those \"worst case scenarios\" where we may need other approaches. I'm not completely closed to economic strategies, but slowly making people vegan does not seem to do anything. What I've proposed in the past is targeted take-downs of single food groups, to crash niche economies one by one. So maybe just get everyone to stop eating something really strange, like geese. Geese are not consumed by the poor(poverty and low income is a very significant factor in the animal exploitation economy, I'm glad there are vegans who will address\/admit this), generally, so it's small niche, and there's an incentive here to virtue signal for wealthy geese consumers, like \"I helped put an end to the torture of a specific species\". It would actually hold weight to it, and it wouldn't cause one to be \"under any delusions\", like you say. This would involve a lot of work and coordination though, and maybe added incentives just to get as many people to play along as possible. Another strategy would be dismantling some animal product which fragments into many smaller products(like dairy), one product at a time. So perhaps gradually just make everyone stop eating, I don't know, Camembert cheese. But here, again, things can still backfire. It's unclear if de-stabilizing these industries wouldn't just force the people who profit from them to just go on to farm ducks, or produce brie, instead, and so on. It's trivially easy to pave the road to hell with good intentions, and our brains are poorly optimized towards feeling good, feeling guilt free, feeling superior to others, etc. This is all bad news, given how high the stakes are.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625703768,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h4f2ks5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ofhad8","locked":false,"name":"t1_h4f2ks5","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_ofhad8","permalink":"\/r\/Utilitarianism\/comments\/ofhad8\/why_is_the_value_of_an_animals_happiness_less\/h4f2ks5\/","retrieved_on":1652704403,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Utilitarianism","subreddit_id":"t5_2revn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Utilitarianism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

There's a causal relationship that differs from life to life and impinges on lives around them either intentionally\/directly, or in some underappreciated way. This then gets jumbled around in ways we often don't understand, extremely so once we play with the \"scope and scale slider\". If we zoom in for a moment, some lives impinge more locally in a very negative way, so for instance, [Gertrude Baniszewski](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo)(NSFL) was not only better off not being born, but far more so because she would grow up to be a sadist of historic proportions towards Sylvia Likens, and encouraged many other children to do the same, grooming psychopathy all around her. The same is true for the prolific serial killers and other torturers, they too would have been better off not born, not only because of their own suffering(which is undeniable and underappreciated) but the exponential suffering they caused, so this is primarily due to the causality around them, in their victims. \n\nIs the reverse possible? Is there a life that impinges positively on those around them? I don't see why not. But the problem with the way the ethics are presented here, is very granular, very small scale, very zoomed in, so we're always assessing every individual life and asking \"Better not born, or?\" when it's a causal soup. You can point to some very obvious cases of \"Better not\", but whether or not every **single** case is better not born, and this is both in principle and in practice, is really hard to fathom in a way that's precise and certain. Certainty is just bizarre to me.\n\nMuch of the bullseye here is really around how evolved creatures like ourselves interact with each other(It's often ethically negative, this is the core problem), but there's of course other causality at play, like the suns rays inducing skin cancer, for instance, so the more we zoom out, the easier the question is to answer, but this answer also becomes less interesting or practically applicable.

There's some feedback here, because we can recognize that we really ought to value something more than we do, which would slowly give us more of the trait that produces the value. There are tensions however between what we value: \n\nWe say we value our health, but we do something we know is unhealthy, like eat foods we know are probably bad. If it's true that health is really more valuable than we appreciate(assuming we know how to be healthy here), and we're still just not able to make sense of what's right, then we just need to look at the mechanics of what makes us fail to value health.

I *did* say I was going to eat less &lt;x&gt;!\" So the crucial variable is to be mindful, and then really closely examine what it is you value.

It's through awareness that we even get here. Cognitive dissonance is a kind of feedback that there could be a problem, and from here, this are among the possibilities:\n\n* To barely notice anything\n* To sort of notice something\n* To feel a real conflict\n* To be utterly lucid towards a conflict\n\nand so on, and these are not guarantees that you'll maintain this state.

There's a part of me (which I think of as the first-person-view of me, because associated thoughts start with \"I\") that says \"I want to eat the pie.\" Then there's another part of me (which I think of as the second-person-view of me, because associated thoughts start with \"you\") that says \"You must not eat the pie!\" Usually what happens is that the first-person-view is in control and eats the pie, while the second-person-view is yelling at it the whole time.\n\nInteresting, I'm glad you articulated it so clearly that because that's useful. I don't distinguish between what you call first and second person perspectives. From my view, these are both just \"I want to eat that pie\" vs. \"I mustn't eat that pie\" , we're just associating with one or the other, based on whatever values are operative for us at the time. Attention means dissociating from \"I want to eat that pie\" \/ \"I mustn't eat that pie\", and certain facts can be revealed from this more lucid vantage point, such as that there is no special self which we *are* and all other selves which we *aren't*-- there's no noble dieter who is our *true* self, while the pesky vice-promoting glutton sits in the shadows and says \"Hehehe.. just the eat the piiiieeeeee!\". I think conceptions like those are one way we get confused about personal identity. These are all appearances in our minds, which we tend to be rag-dolled by depending on the circumstances, and the antidote to said rag-dolling seems to be awareness because it causes a shift from identifying with the thought to instead observing the thought. Why is this useful? Why should anyone bother? One reason is we wouldn't want to be confused about ourselves. We wouldn't want to think we're the good pie eater, or the bad pie eater, if these are fantasy concepts we become lost in. We wouldn't want to hate ourselves over the pie when there's no need to or reason to, or we wouldn't want to eat more pie than is necessary if it's a bad idea, etc. We can only manage these things if there's a deficiency in attention\/awareness. Sufficient awareness means association to thoughts like \"I am so gross for eating that whole pie\" become far less coherent than \"That was too much pie\" with zero added baggage.\n\n&gt;So I would claim that I'm aware of values and their priority. In fact, I'm aware of multiple sets of values and priorities, all within my mind. What I lack is unity of purpose.\n\nI think you'd be surprised how quickly the mind becomes unaware of values\/priority if you put a lot more time and effort towards looking at the mind. I don't know of anyone who seriously takes up this project who doesn't come to this conclusion. Unfortunately this project sounds very unsexy to people, so people can't just go \"You should take time out of your day to sit there doing what appears to be... nothing\". Nonetheless I would recommend it.\n\nEdit, 'cause I didn't catch your edit, and it's very significant:\n\n&gt; I have done some meditation of this sort before, and I found it amusing because thoughts do creep in persistently. (I found it most effective to focus on an itching sensation, without scratching the itch.) But I'm not sure how it's relevant here.\n\nThat's huge, yeah. Just notice how subtly thoughts slip in, and how effortlessly the mind is just ripped away. Once you finish this paragraph, or perhaps even a few seconds after this sentence, *something* is going to yank the leash on your attention span in a way that is actually quite bewildering, if we could just notice even *this*. That's how *bad* we are, by nature. We should be **extremely** skeptical of any \"Awareness is the default\" or \"Awareness is high in humans\" claims. We are *profoundly* unaware and this is only apparent if one trains, in the same way as if... I don't know, humans were on the absolute rock bottom of the humanoid gradient in the universe, in terms of strength, and out of a trillion species, we were utter weaklings with muscular atrophy who told ourselves \"Eh, seems fine!

Something... strange, going on in that sub. One mod apparently had been \"collecting evidence\" that I'm awful or something, for a very, very long time. But no evidence was shown to me other than two posts which were mischaracterized fairly obviously. This was particularly bizarre because I had what I thought was a friendly chat with a mod roughly a few weeks earlier, they had PM'ed me because I criticized some reactions to a post about a disabled person having a child and it was just pointless circlejerking against a person who clearly had suffered so much but they committed 'the great sin of birth', of course, the mindless predatory pack behavior that tends to appear on r\/Antinatalism was everywhere. I pointed it out and was downvoted as usual. This mod, who I won't name, thanked me, and really insisted how hard they work to moderate the sub and don't tolerate abuse towards people who are simply making an effort to be good parents, etc. It wasn't that short of a chat, and I shared a few thoughts\/concerns, and I told them how hard I thought it was to moderate things fairly and thanked them for reaching out, and how much of a thankless job moderating the sub must be, and there was just no sign of any issue.\n\nThen...\n\nBanned, by this same mod, weeks later. Apparently they had been \"Gathering evidence\" of me, for a long time, but conveniently, \"Too many posts to provide evidence of\"(paraphrasing). Recognize how much of a red flag this behavior is. Why would this mod not simply tell me, \"Hey-- what you said here is not okay, so I just want to let you know to be more careful in how you speak to people here\". From here, whatever misunderstanding there was could have been sorted out in a sane way. But notice how odd it is for a person to *gather evidence* of your guilt and then finally accuse you, claiming to have mountains of evidence, present **almost nothing**, and then ban you, mute you, and ignore every single thing you write in your defense.

It's simply the case that being less privileged in life(as a result of arbitrary values, which is a word I used, but they ignored) increases one's chances at recognizing and sympathizing with Antinatalism, or pessimism in general. I've defended people countless times from these very standards on a wide range of subreddits, so there's really no reason to think I'd endorse some kind of ableism or superiority\/inferiority. I have a long track record of being pretty vocally against that.\n\nThey finally accused me of calling the person I was speaking to a psychopath, when I was doing the *opposite* of that, by ignoring the italics I used:\n\n&gt; You're not *just* a psychopath (what they were reading)\n\nversus\n\n&gt; You're *not* just a psychopath (what I *actually* said)\n\nNow, maybe these aren't native English speakers, or maybe they just made a simple mistake, but if this *was* a mistake, it should have been easy to sort out. What they instead did was they told me I had to apologize for calling the specific person I was speaking to a psychopath(Something I didn't do) or they would \"mark me as spam\" if I wrote another word in my defense, which I don't even know what that means, but they said it alongside an air of threat, like \"*trust me*, you *don't* want that option\".

A police reserved unity full of old normal people got from normal to commiting genocide without any force within months. What makes most people think they are different? Do they have a reason for it, or they just can't accept human nature? I said all that in order to avoid getting myself condemned with labels for expressing opinions and reduce other people's feelings of aburdity... At some extent.\n\nIt just appears as if you're making an argument that may or may not include ideas like:\n\na) A beings traits produce it's ethical intuitions(a malevolent\/callous god would just destroy its underlings, etc)\n\nb) Humans are beings which are, through certain traits, presumably, oriented towards things like genocide, murder, etc, and potentially, other unethiccal behavior.(humans who are otherwise peaceful effortlessly turn into savage killers under high stress or certain conditions)\n\nThat's *one* broad set of claims, under one umbrella, right? From this point, you don't get any conclusions. You don't get anything like \"therefore, ethics is arbitrary\" or anything like that. It's really just a standalone observation. Do you think otherwise?\n\n&gt; Murder isn't bad for the victim, they simply won't get harmed. You can say that the method of killing a person will logically cause pain, but that can be solved with government getting involved(which isn't something as far fetched as people may think) and giving people methods to do such actions in a painless, fast manner. \n\nOkay so you're presenting a hypothetical here, right? You're claiming that murder isn't bad for the victim in *principle*, because it's conceivable, in principle, for all murderers to use perfected, painless methods. That's... fine, I guess, but in practice, murder is bad for the victim. A murderer-victim relationship implies:\n\nA victim exists in a world containing murderers. This is a bad thing, objectively, because the sorts of people who are oriented to frivolously murder others, and make judgements over the lives of others, are not good people. If you were trapped in a room with a person who forced their desires, however arbitrary, over your desires, often in very ethically signifiant ways, and could not negotiate, and your lack of consent was totally ignored, that would be not just subjectively bad for you, that would be **objectively** bad for you.\n\nFrom this point, you get to all the ways in which murder is bad for the people to whom the victim of murder was important. These people not only lose the person they didn't want to lose, they too have to now exist in this hellworld apparently full of murderers who are forcing their sociopathic desires(and in the hypothetical, bizarrely, and out of character, are suddenly doing it painlessly-- we'll grant it, but it doesn't change as much as you think it does).\n\nTo come up with a scenario where all murderers are now painlessly murdering is *somewhat* interesting in the sense that all thought experiments with technical points are interesting, but it's not *meaningful*, because it has no actual coherence to the behavior, desires, and traits of the sorts of people who would frivolously murder others. Murderers don't care, and that's because they're psychopaths or sociopaths or narcissists, generally. It's not merely a matter of preference that this is disturbing(again, think back to how disturbed you would be in that room with that person who has power over you and doesn't care about your interests), but it's in line with basic concepts like consent and fair treatment and an acknowledgement that causing people to suffer frivolously or pointlessly or selfishly, is wrong. If words like \"wrong\" are to mean anything at all, then these concepts are precisely the concepts such words cohere with. Now, if someone doubts this, or begins to play some semantic game and say \"Meh, it's all subjective\" or \"Eh, nothing really matters, universe don't care\", then that person is full of shit, because the moment you get that person in that hypothetical room with that individual that's leering at you from the corner, looking at you like you're a fucking snack, that's when the real honesty kicks in and the bullshit semantic game vanishes promptly.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625787021,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h4j5plu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oghkrh","locked":false,"name":"t1_h4j5plu","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_oghkrh","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/oghkrh\/ceasing_existences\/h4j5plu\/","retrieved_on":1652695804,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It's more complicated than I once thought. I thought it was obvious at first, that something like Futurama's suicide booths were something along the lines of the right way. I look at cases like [this](https:\/\/youtu.be\/m_6Y5H9ngZc?t=89) and [this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=S8Axe8lyhL0) and many others like this and these are the easy cases, right? Here is where I think even many right-to-die supporters are actually too conservative, because you'll often hear people say \"I support the right to die, but of course, we'd need a rigorous system in place to make sure people are really sure\/of sound mind\/etc\" Here I think there's no hoop to jump through whatsoever, the option is immediately on the table, no questions asked.\n\n\nBut giving *everyone* this level of access, I think could very easily lead to worse outcomes in the long run. To intuit this, you simply have to create the absurd scenario to the other degree:\n\nImagine an 18 year old close friend who leads a perfectly content life. They even enjoy a relatively high level of privilege and fortune, in fact. One day, they cut themselves on a knife in the kitchen, and at that moment, for some reason, the neurons and neurochemistry just happened to be oriented to \"This is utterly unacceptable, and I need to die immediately.\"\n\n\"Everything is *ruined*\", they'd say. Just imagine how this conversation would unfold for you, as this person's friend, and therefore, someone who has their best interests in mind. You could state the obvious that it's just a cut, and that these heal. You could point to how satisfied they were before, or to any silver linings. But nothing works, let's say. And this person *insists* on death. Even painful death is somehow, paradoxically, being considered by this person.\n\nIt's fair to say that if this could happen, this person would be *simply* confused. This isn't a claim about some larger ontology or ethics or philosophy. We're not speaking about some \"gotcha\" where this is in fact actually hell, the aliens are coming tomorrow to enslave and torture us, and this person's, for lack of a better word, psychosis, is right for the wrong reasons. The point of this experiment is to admit that it's *possible* to be confused about suicide.\n\nOnce we admit we can be wrong, then we can see that we don't want a society that frivolously tells people they can just kill themselves painlessly at any time, because that leads to a) potentially good people dying when they need not die b) people who would prefer to not die, if they were simply lucky enough to not be confused c) incentives for bullying someone to death d) the same issue, just in the other way, where suicide is utterly abolished and forbidden, in the sense of \"Your life has so much \"value\" that we'll force torture upon you always rather than let you die\"(insane)\/\"Your life has so much \"value\" that we won't even give a shit if your reasons for dying are good or not.\n\nIt's possible to commit suicide purely for attention\/fame. It's possible to commit suicide purely to spite someone. It's possible to die for *bad reasons*, in other words, so total, limitless suicide, I'm pretty convinced is wrong. But we clearly need to move quite a bit farther towards relaxing restrictions, because the current scenario is deranged, and the stakes are very high in how many people are being pointlessly tortured, often for no good reason other than profit\/economic maximization.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625806992,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h4k5a08","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oe9uxt","locked":false,"name":"t1_h4k5a08","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_oe9uxt","permalink":"\/r\/BirthandDeathEthics\/comments\/oe9uxt\/right_to_die_whats_your_take\/h4k5a08\/","retrieved_on":1652693714,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BirthandDeathEthics","subreddit_id":"t5_3hdt91","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BirthandDeathEthics","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

No free will(which I subscribe to) does not necessitate nihilism, that's a common confusion, because moral nihilism is not predicated on free choice, it's predicated on parameters of ethical salience like conscious beings(a universe of unconsciousness has no ethical salience, as a matter of objective fact). It's wrong to torture you, for example, whether free will exists or not, simply because you'd immensely suffer in both instances. The pointless misery, the injustice, the robbing you of your agency(notice how utterly irrelevant free vs. unfree agency here is-- if you were a highly sentient, feeling android, running on code engineered by humans, with 100% predictable thoughts and behaviors, it would not matter in the case of wrongfully imprisoning you, or dominating you, etc).\n\nSo no free will has nothing to do with moral nihilism, and determinism does not mean that it's pointless to do anything because choices impinge on reality in a variety of ways whether they're freely made or not. In other words, things are not *so determined* that nothing you do will change any outcome. If a person is being tortured outside of our home, *someone* still has to do something for the torture to stop. Everyone can't simply sit around and say \"Oh well, may as well not do anything-- determinism.\" Whether or not there's any freedom is irrelevant here as well.\n\nThat being said...\n\nWhat you asked originally is still a valid question under moral realism because it could be the case that promortalism is true, under certain circumstances, or even in general just for anything alive in the universe. The main good reason to live is to better understand reality so we make the right choice. It's good to not pretend we've figured everything out, and we should be able recognize that our ignorance is great, and there are many ways to be wrong. One could be right in committing suicide, but one could be wrong, too, and if other options are on offer, we should entertain those options as long as possible. Some people don't have this option, and are killed by other people. Others don't have this option and are killed by unconscious processes, like being unfortunate enough to live with excruciating pain(physical and\/or psychological) that no human around them can help relieve them of, and the only move out of is suicide.

If you have a hard life especially, seeing people who are unaware of just how bad it gets, makes the ostracism and negative states of mind that tend to be produced from a hard life, worse. But it's also possible to be wrong in the other direction. It's possible to have such a hard life that one is doomed to fail to see even silver linings, or be defeatist across the board.

The only way people ever seem to argue against this is via semantic games that try to do things like point to a null value and say \"You can't make value judgements about null values!\" but these are not honest\/precise games, because there's a nature to the null property in that it is null, but then there are adjacent claims you can make *about* that nature.

Finding the door to exit the room has nothing to do with morality, it's a descriptive statement, on the \"is\" side of the is-ought distinction. \n\nThere's no claim being made that the door mattering has anything to do with morality. If you value leaving the room, you need to value where the door is, to exit the room in any reliable way. \"The door is in &lt;location&gt;\" is an is statement, but \"I want to exit this room reliably\" is a statement with implicit values. But yeah, there's no greater source of moral confusion today than Hume and people who think he slammed the gavel on epistemology until the end of time, but the confusion there is so dense it tends to be hopeless to try to untangle. It's basically a semantic trick that uses oughts derived from is, to say that oughts can't be derived from is, and the implication therefore is that oughts are always brittle in a way that is's aren't.\n\nOughts are loaded into everything we do, and we don't have a problem with their existence anywhere except in ethics. Why *ought* we value logic and reason? We just do, and it's good that we do. An utterly illogical Kafkaesque hell is worse. Objectively. It's a pity that people who are clever skeptics of this idea can't be forced to double down by being invited(with their consent) into the illogical Kafkaesque hell simulator until they scream the safe-word. Likewise, why *ought* we value ethics? The same confused person who is too unaware to realize that they use logic and reason to be **skeptical** of logic and reason, asks this kind of question. Again, it may unfortunately be that we need to offer them the hell simulator, until they scream the safe word. Here's what these skeptics could say:\n\n\"Okay, so it turns out that I was a tragically confused. Valuing logic and reason is a good thing, objectively, for conscious creatures. Words have to mean something. \"Two\" has to mean something, there's a fact of the matter to \"Two\" and to \"Good\", in the exact same descriptive, is-based sense. In the context of conscious beings. One such fact, I now realize, is: \"Torturing everything that exists to **perfection** is bad\". Sure, I had to be tortured to discover this fact, but it doesn't mean the fact is less factual. People can be coerced through torture, but this time it's genuine insight that I lacked prior to the torture, because it seemed to be the only avenue to get me to discover that I was confused about epistemology. I now understand that there really is an **objective** fact of the matter to a word like \"Bad\"-- and it's composed of 100% \"Is\" statements, in the totality of ontological description-- I was just thinking too pragmatically, in too narrow terms, and in too epistemologically isolated, rigid, granular, zoomed in, a framework.\"\n\nThis isn't an argument to convince anyone who is convinced by Hume, it's simply a description of the problem itself.

It's not an honest approach to ethics. Ethics has something to do with conscious beings, not rocks(insofar as rocks are unconscious, and therefore, have **objectively** no moral salience). This is a confusion, because ethical facts are descriptions of entailing consciousness, where as mathematical truths for example, do not require consciousness in ontological terms, they only require consciousness in epistemological terms. Ethics on the other hand deals with consciousness both in ontology and epistemology.\n\nNot all problems may be universally bad in quite the same way, but universal problems(in principle) are universally bad. There are a set of problems that we already know face all conscious beings. There's a configuration of reality where you're being tortured as slowly and as painfully as possible, and that's bad locally for you, but it's also universally bad. \"But how?!\" An anti-realist would ask. Psychopaths exist, and they may not only not care, but actually delight in your torture. First of all, disagreement does not mean that there isn't an answer to the problem. We can disagree on whether 2+2 results in 4 or 5, but pointing to someone with a different opinion has nothing do with there being an objective answer to the question. Second, a psychopath may not be oriented to understand right and wrong, but if you just tortured them enough, they'd realize, and on firm ground, that being frivolously tortured by something more powerful *really sucks*. From here, they could say: \"Torture doesn't only really suck for me, it really sucks for \/u\/Ma1eficent too. Torture sucks **universally**\" Or they will just remain stuck in a phenomenology that makes them morally ignorant. It wouldn't be any less arbitrary than someone who simply has the sort of brain that leads the to confidently assert \"2+2=5!\", you either admit this person is not oriented for mathematics, or you cause them to change their representation of reality somehow.\n\nIn other words, universal torture, is universally bad, by definition, and that is objectively bad in the same way that 2 and 2 objectively results in 4. The word \"bad\" is not especially arbitrary in a way that the word \"two\" is not, it's just that \"two\" is a highly simplistic description of reality, and \"bad\" is a highly complex and nuanced description.

Although, as I shall show later, the incidence of sexual assault of males is significantly underestimated and taken insufficiently seriously, it is the case that women are more frequently the victims of sexual assault.\n\n&gt; The second exception is one kind of domestic violence, but this is exceptional in an unusual way. In its spousal or “intimate partner” form, 37 the phrase “domestic violence” is routinely understood to refer to the violence husbands or boyfriends inflict on wives or girlfriends. The general perception is that spousal violence is almost exclusively the violent treatment of women by their husbands, boyfriends or other male partners. However, this perception is mistaken. Many studies have shown that wives use violence against their husbands at least as much as husbands use violence against their wives, 38 Given how unexpected such findings are to many people, at least one well-known author (who shared the prevailing prejudices prior to his quantitative research) examined the data in multiple ways in order to determine whether these could be reconciled with common views. 39 On almost every score, women were as violent as men. It was found that half the violence is mutual, and in the remaining half there were an equal number of female and male aggressors. 40 When a distinction was drawn between “normal violence” (pushing, shoving, slapping and throwing things) and “severe violence” (kicking, biting, punching, hitting with an object, “beating up” and attacking the spouse with a knife or gun), the rate of mutual violence dropped to a third, the rate of violence by only the husband remained the same but the rate of violence by only the wife increased. 41 Wives have been shown to initiate violence as often as husbands do. 42 At least some studies have suggested that there is a higher rate of wives assaulting husbands than husbands assaulting wives, 43 and most studies of dating violence show higher rates of female-inflicted violence. 44 It is thus not the case, as some have suggested, that female violence against intimate partners is usually in self-defense.\n\n&gt; Research findings on the effects of spousal violence are mixed. Some have found that husbands inflict more damage on wives than wives do on husbands. 45 It has been suggested that this is because husbands are generally bigger and stronger than their wives. 46 However, other studies have found that wives inflict more damage on husbands. 47 If weapons are used, the smaller size of women would make no difference to their capacity to cause injury. Yet other studies have found no difference in the severity of injury caused by male and female partners. 48\n\n&gt; Thus spousal violence is an exception to the trend that men are at greater risk of being the victims of violence, not because men are at lesser risk but because they are at comparable risk. However, the mistaken perception that wives do not batter husbands itself causes further disadvantage to males. Abused men are taken less seriously than abused women when they complain of abuse or seek help. There are also fewer resources to aid abused men.\n\nI didn't include the sources because it would be too much to link into each number individually and too sloppy to paste, but if someone wants them, I'll post them.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625872260,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h4n8t36","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oh0ecr","locked":false,"name":"t1_h4n8t36","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h4m66ee","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/oh0ecr\/opinion_on_raskfeminists\/h4n8t36\/","retrieved_on":1652687205,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

As an analogy, this would be like if Christianity invented the deadlift, bicep curl, shoulder press, the squat, etc. This is a technique that is utterly secular-- mindfulness meditation *is* the exercise which targets attention in the same way that the bicep curl is the exercise which targets biceps. It's been fairly in vogue within neuroscience for quite some time now to study the effects of something like mindfulness meditation, and there are demonstrable changes in some very interesting brain regions. This has real overlap philosophically due to the philosophical problem of consciousness, and the philosophy of personal identity, which Buddhism, through said techniques, claim that there is really no such thing as what we call the \"Self\".

This doesn't just extend to identity, but our brains are generally [bad at processing reality](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=R3pbZIqjULk). We didn't evolve brains to be more and more accurate about reality, or about ourselves, we just evolved pattern-recognition systems that made us feel like reality and ourselves were coherent concepts, because these ways of being were advantageous, evolutionarily.\n\n&gt; Now what I defend is that consciousness is not any different from that. Imagine you were suddenly frozen: your consciousness would be halted, it would literally die. Now if you were defrosted and brought back to life, would your regained consciousness be the same as the one before you were frozen? Does it come back from some kind of limbo, or is it a totally new product of the brain? \n\nYes, these are all right, but we don't even necessarily need to pretend to be suddenly frozen or draw analogies to lamps, though-- we have the perfect analogy on offer to all of us right here and now: We fall asleep every single night, and we lose consciousness. The crucial variable seems to be memory. Without memory, every moment would be some kind Kafkaesque, incoherent hell. Actually, there are cases of people who have a special kind of amnesia where memories only last minutes or something like that, although these usually involve some kind of damage to the brain and memory is complex and (I *think*) not localized to a specific region.\n\n&gt; And even if we are not frozen: seeing and having understood the examples above, is our current consciousness (and therefore our current self) the same one from, say, one hour ago? Or are we being renovated constantly, like our sight, like the light of a lamp?\n\nI want to distinguish consciousness, and the self. These may sound trivial or synonymous but they're actually very different concepts. Consciousness is the \"There is an experience\" experience. You're conscious right now, if you're reading this sentence right now-- that's simply a matter of fact. *Something* is happening, *something* is being experienced. That's consciousness.\n\n Now the *self*, is something else that can emerge from *that* experience-- it's the sensation within consciousness that says:\n\n \"I'm me-- there's a thinker to these thoughts. These thoughts are a part of my *identity*. I *associate* with these thoughts, feelings, emotions, physical sensations, visual field, and from these appearances in consciousness, I form a self-model that I call \"Me\" \". There are schools of thought that say that entire process of self is an illusion. Some people even claim *consciousness* is an illusion, but I think those people are using some strange definition, because the only thing in existence that can't possibly be an illusion is consciousness.

That's how *you* sound, right now.\n\n&gt;  You keep talking about your ban as though we didn’t give you the opportunity to discuss with us.\n\nYou... literally didn't. You ignored everything I wrote. In fact, I submitted two pages in response to your accusations. Within 1 minute of me sending that, you began *more* accusations, while never addressing what I said, which means it was *literally impossible* for you to have even given a fair attempt to read it. You weren't interested in listening, because you had already made your mind up. You said as much to another redditor, in fact, before I even said a word to you:\n\n&gt; It doesn't matter what you think. I have saved everything they've said. You may not have seen it, but that doesn't mean what I have evidence of is invalid because you 'feel' otherwise. - \/u\/atomicallyabsent \n\nWhat does it mean to have an attitude that says, \"I will *not* change my mind\" ? What's the point of an appeal?\n\n&gt; You won’t even admit what you said. You keep deflecting and bringing up the ‘psychopath’ part, when I dropped it and explained to you already that everything else you said was what got you banned. Not the “psychopath” part.\n\nWell that's really odd of you to say, because I couldn't even defend myself about the 'psychopath' part-- here's the ultimatum. This is the last message I received before I could even say another word:\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ExyMp6v.png\n\nHow could I \"keep deflecting\" if I couldn't even point out that the 'psychopath' part was a misquoting of me? Again, I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps you're not a native English speaker, I genuinely have no idea. Here's what **you** think I said:\n\n&gt; You're not *just* a psychopath - (What you're claiming I said)\n\nHere's what I **actually** wrote:\n\n&gt; You're *not* just a psychopath - (my actual words-- do you understand what the emphasis on \"not\" means?)\n\nThese two sentences have very different meanings. What does it mean to continue to refuse to acknowledge this?\n\nLet's look at the other accusation. Again, this is your **only** other accusation. One was that I allegedly called someone a psychopath(I was doing the *opposite*, again, try ... really try, to reflect on what it means to not only make this big of an error, but also refuse to correct it.) The accusation is the post that starts \"Eh, I don't see it to be a matter of intelligence personally,\". What I told you in the modmail:\n\n* It's simply true that ethics has nothing to do with intelligence, you can be genius and pure evil, or you can have low IQ, and be quite kind and ethical. Pretending that antinatalists are smart and the natalists are dumb, and it being that simple, is just embarrassing, and you never want to ban people who point this out. \n\n* The only part of this comment that I regret writing is the very last sentence I wrote, about the drinking game, where I mocked the circle-jerking, because I think it was written in utter frustration. Where I actually think I blundered here ethically, after giving my post a thorough assessment, is I lost sight of the fact that the community here is essentially a support group for people who are suffering like everyone else. I fully admitted to this mistake.\n\n* Re: \"AN is for people who have suffered\/people who are undesirable by society's arbitrary standards) -- \nIf you read this post with the worst intentions possible, you'll get a certain interpretation that looks like it's supporting some kind of eugenicist chauvinist position towards antinatalists, or saying they're worthless, or something like that. Let's be crystal clear here: That is a huge distance away from what I'm actually saying. What I'm *actually* saying here, is understood through the word \"arbitrary\". This is a *description* of a society that values the wrong things in people, this is the sense in which I'm describing people as undesirable. What I've written is a description, and in no way an endorsement, and for me to call people *actually* undesirable is completely incoherent from every other value I constantly make an effort to express. I spend all day just broadcasting loudly the idea that everyone has moral value. I try my best *even* to defend the people I find personally revolting and reprehensible, because I don't want to live in the sort of world where you'd beat an alligator to death or torture it because of the \"crime\" it committed by being a dangerous creature that terrorizes other creatures, which is to my eyes, the same thing as what we'd call an \"evil person\". Both are suffering from their ignorance about what is ethically true. In light of this explanation, and comments like [this one](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/F9xXnZW.png), and [this one](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CpjkADN.png)(if you've got tons of patience, you can find many more like this), is there an actual good reason to think I wouldn't extend this position to Antinatalists? I am criticizing behaviors, but there's no way I can coherently think an Antinatalist should be mistreated if I'm constantly saying it's wrong to mistreat *every* living thing because being blameworthy for a moral error is a confused idea that just causes harm(Something I write on an almost daily basis). \n\nWhat does it mean to ignore these explanations, and not directly address them at face value u\/atomicallyabsent? I bet there are even some people who would say they don't like me, but would still admit that I constantly defend people from society's arbitrary standards. It's quite a farfetched interpretation to say I'm somehow endorsing the view that someone is undesirable, and very worrying if someone doubles down on this position, over, and over, and over(all while saying my attempts at rationally resolving this are \"crying\" and \"whining\" -- do you realize what a huge red flag that is?).

He quoted a very specific accusation, which was the *opposite* of what I was accused of saying, and then made it clear I couldn't defend myself in response to what he just accused me of. How does this look?\n\n&gt; He was referring to the last part where you said “you’ve been harmed to some real degree by being here” after she told you to leave her alone. \n\nHad she told me to leave her alone, I most likely would have. It's a discussion forum, anyway-- a good way to not get another reply is to not engage with someone. But at no point did she \"tell\" me to \"leave her alone\"-- that's clearly not true, so I have no idea why you'd even attempt to say that. Do you think \"bye\" means \"leave me alone\", or something? As for \"you've been harmed to some real degree by being here\", that's a reference to Earth.\n\n&gt; You're not *just* a psychopath happily watching the hellish events on Earth unfold, you've been harmed to some real degree by being here.\n\nOn. Earth. Translation: \"You're *not* simply some bad person, watching the awful things on our planet, by being on this planet, you've experienced harm, on this planet.\"\n\n&gt; Because I wrote PARAGRAPHS to you about that part ALONE and only 1 sentence about the psycho part. You intentionally stuck to the psycho part and ignored everything else I said. \n\nYeah, you wrote paragraphs of accusations, while ignoring and never addressing my responses. You included so many that it was impossible to have a coherent conversation. You told me how sure you are of what I've written, and how you have it all saved, and how you're so disturbed, and how you can't fathom how I'd \"allow myself to interact with the members here that way\". You told me you \"don't know why I'm here if [I] can even allow myself to say some of the garbage [I've] said about us\" You told me that you think I \"Love to look down on others\".\n\n...What? Where? Show me where I'm \"looking down on others\". Show me \"some of the garbage\". You didn't. Anywhere. It was just accusations, to which I tried to respond(there were **two** posts only), which you ignored. Those were our \"paragraphs\".\n\n&gt; She told you that she hasn’t been harmed, she told you to leave her alone, and your scummy ass kept harassing her “wElL aHeM aS a MaTtEr oF FaKt U HalFv bEeN hArmEd ToO sUm ReAl DeGreE!!!!!!”\n\n&gt; We explained this to you over and over and over and over again that you have NO right to tell someone that they have been harmed and therefore are AN because of it. She asked you to leave her alone and clearly said that she fit into neither of those categories you so desperately tried to box her into. \n\nYou keep saying she told me to leave her alone, but that's just not true. Show me. Instead of baseless accusations, **show me**. How do I have no right to tell someone that? Simply being on Earth and experiencing a very generic level of suffering can be enough to become sympathetic to Antinatalism. Do you think people with incredible, deeply satisfying lives tend to become Antinatalist? If you have such a life, then congratulations, but most Antinatalists are not this privileged. In the end, I'm expressing an opinion in a discussion forum, and I think life on Earth is bad for really everyone. Being on Earth is a harm, and if it wasn't, many fewer AN's would exist. That's the opinion you want to ban people for? Pointing this out to someone who doesn't share it, in a discussion forum, is what you want to ban people for?\n\n&gt; You are the biggest chunk of hateful shit I’ve ever encountered. For you to harass a member like that, and not care at all, and consistently attempt to change the topic or put words in our mouth so you don’t have to take responsibility is amazing. \n\nThat's a very interesting thing to tell someone, but I'm not sure you realize what it tells people about you, otherwise you wouldn't a) refuse to address the clarifications I tried to make until I was threatened that I couldn't make more b) Refuse to address a single point of clarification in our recent, public conversations. You accused me of calling someone a psychopath repeatedly, when I was saying the **opposite**-- this level of error appears to not worry you in the *slightest* or provoke an apology from you. Normally when people who give a shit about the truth make this big of a mistake, they're taken aback and profusely apologize, or feel some kind of shame-- What does that say, given what you've done and not done here? c) Constantly smear and insult me from the start of you banning me, tell me I'm \"not a real antinatalist\", tell me that I'm manipulative, hateful, stupid, trolling, saying you've collected mountains of evidence against me, too much to post in fact,(while, 4 weeks earlier, having a very cordial chat which you engaged me with, where I thanked you and we had a thoughtful exchange after meeting for the first time? Where was the evidence you've been collecting for so long in that chat? Why not say, \"Oh by the way-- some posts of yours have been problematic , just a heads up, but can you stop doing &lt;whatever you have a problem with&gt;? What does it mean to *not* do this?), etc-- while I've more or less attempted to have a sane discussion with you.\n\nAnyway, I think this is probably going to be my last message to you here, because now everything that could have been said, really has.

There are good kinds, and bad kinds, in principle. In practice, our hierarchies tend to be superficial and\/or unethical. They give clever, lucky thugs and egomaniacs most of the power and status, and no one likes that.\n\n Not even the thugs do, in principle(they love it in practice), because if they could just understand(They probably can't), how much better the world would be for everyone if we weren't crushed under a pyramidal structure where Prince George gets to live in luxury as a \"lucky child\" and receive nothing but the best, while [some kids](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/DKHaveM.png) live in maximum poverty is obscene, and a clear pathology of hierarchy.\n\nThere's a \"reality element\" to hierarchy in that everything is going to be unequal, but I don't see it being impossible to change the pathological structure of how we organize ourselves or what we value. If we do it by force, then yes, new hierarchies just pop up-- and that's why communism when attempted by idealistic monkeys has been a disaster, because it just loses to the crushing brutal power and dominance system(both internally, and externally). But there are clever ways to approach the problem in less direct or even completely indirect ways. I think the first way is to stop valuing hierarchy. Stop valuing power. Stop valuing status. These are all arbitrary things. Royals mean absolutely *nothing*. Looks mean nothing. Wealth means nothing. Power is utterly arbitrary. Yes, it's powerful, but it's *as* arbitrary as being [the predator or being the prey](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=175), it's not something you should get a medal for, it's not something you should be in awe of. \n\nYou should recognize however that certain traits apply to power that are in direct conflict with ethics. To \"win\" a game of pure power, is to **be** unethical, and this is simply due to game theory, if being good means being constrained by a set of rules that amount to \"this is ethical\", and being evil is being unconstrained by said rules, then all else being equal, evil beats good. Every action that good can do, aside from some ultimate good, evil can also do, to feign being good. But good can't do these things-- good is limited to being good. It's a completely different game, it's being a completely different person, it's caring vs. not caring about sentient beings, and so on. You just lose the fight because you strategically do not have the same moves. It does not seem to be the case that power is highly synergistic with ethics, but the opposite is certainly true-- the most powerful people just don't care about ethics unless caring about ethics somehow benefits their power. So you can either value superficial winning, you can either tell the lion that they're a great big winner for eating the baby herbivore alive, or you can say \"No, this is stupid and arbitrary, and unethical.\".\n\nWhen you defend hierarchy **as it exists today**(bolding the most crucial part-- again, there are *good* hierarchies in principle), you're tacitly supporting: a) power b) immorality. Power values vs. Ethics values is what makes [this](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KLpM0bo.jpeg) happen. That's the world where [power is king, and therefore, evil is king](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg), our current world.

It can be cathartic if you're still suffering as a result of what negligent adults told you when you were younger.\n\nIf it's just the \"toxic waste\" kind of anxiety, then yeah, this is just a kind of philosophical, ontological worry in general. The best answer I have for you is no matter what this place is, it seems like the best strategy is to just try to do the right thing and orient yourself to make sense of the world in a way that can process the truth in as resilient of a way as possible. This is carefully worded to not endorse... strategies that can make things seem better temporarily, like, say, becoming an alcoholic, but won't necessarily orient you to the truth, or work in the long term. Likewise, convincing ourselves of some kind of fantasy optimism probably will feel good, and leads to survival in a hell-like world, but it's not in touch with the truth.\n\nIf this world is so bad, then there are elements of it that are truly out of our control. The worst scenarios that fuel your anxiety, for instance, malevolent gods who would \"Send you to hell\" after you die, etc, all these kinds of ideas-- they seem to fall firmly into the category of \"outside of our control\", no? So if we recognize this with total attention, the anxiety just falls on its face. It makes no sense. It's like flailing around when you know the bomb is chained to you, you know that there's 1 hour on the clock, you know you're locked in a metal cage and there's no key and nothing to pick the lock and the metal is too hard, and you can't disarm the bomb, so... what else is there to do? \n\nNothing. Right? Just sit. Maybe the bomb will explode and you'll instantly die. Maybe the bomb will explode and party streamers will emerge. But in a scenario where there's nothing you can do, then flailing around or sobbing or punching the bars, only make things worse.

For instance, what are you calling \"you\"? For most people, personal identity is only coherent through a few elements of the mind. One element is the ego, the self. The thing that says \"I'm me\", \"I want stuff\", \"I don't want other stuff\", and so on. That \"you\", can be turned off. When you turn this part off, through drugs, or certain exercises, really *mindblowing*(not too far from literally) phenomenologies are accessible. Unfortunately, you need some level of luck to get this kind of esoteric knowledge. You first need some combination of traits that lead you to be the sort of person who takes these drugs. You need the luck to take the right drugs, and have the right experiences. It's fully possible to be unlucky here, too.\n\nWith no ego, there's just no desire, right? We're not talking about rocks here, so this is compatible with something like panpsychism even. If rocks are conscious but have no ego, their phenomenology doesn't have a delineation with the rest of the universe. To explain to you what that would mean if *you* had this experience, that would be like being utterly self-less to the point of not even understand the concept of being a self. That would be like looking at your hand right now, resting on the mouse, or keyboard, or desk, or your phone, and seeing no actual point of delineation. There's no boundary where you could say, \"Ah yes, *this* is where \"me\" begins\". None of that would make sense-- there'd be no \"you\", **just** experience. And there'd be no *reaction* to the experience. There'd be no \"Ahhhhh, this is bad!\" or \"Ooohhhh, this is good!\". That's all egocentric self-based narrative. People who lack the required experience, can't understand this in most cases. One way to describe this is \"esoteric knowledge\" -- things that cannot be conveyed through mere language, but must be experienced firsthand to be understood, a *specific* kind of a posteriori knowledge.\n\nAnother element is memory. To have this persisting self that has experienced things before, memory does a lot of heavy lifting. Rocks have no neurons. Atoms have no neurons. A corpse has neurons, but there's no reason to think they're active when they brain dies, right? We've put corpses into EEG's before, I assume this is one of the *first* things we did with our various imaging and diagnostic technology of the brain-- we observed the hell out of the brain to see if it's *really* dead. It seems to be really dead, and that includes memory.\n\nWithout memory and without ego, there's really nothing at all like what you're calling \"you\" to occur, after death. Of course, we could just be wrong. This could all be an experience machine like the Matrix. Who knows. But that explanation I think is more likely to be an engineered meme to control a new era of more educated peasantry, since religion is trending downwards among younger people. Powerful people will always try to control the middle and bottom of the pyramid through memes and engineered ideas, so it's really a matter of asking:\n\n \"**Who** could this idea benefit, ultimately?\"","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626136004,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h4zeb8h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oj2n1z","locked":false,"name":"t1_h4zeb8h","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h4zadfx","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/oj2n1z\/is_there_an_afterlife\/h4zeb8h\/","retrieved_on":1652623723,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

At the end of the day, even after experiencing ego loss, your ego comes back. But desire can exist separately from ego. Why does there need to be an ego for me to desire good things in this world? For things to be working properly? \n\nYou're right, those two aren't incompatible. We sound insane when we say this, of course, because anyone who has only ever operated under the ego phenomenology will find that idea completely nonsensical. How could the ego and desire be compatible if the ego is the thing that's desiring? It's simple, you can recognize desire through sheer awareness, with no identification to it. This is a hard one but maybe it makes sense right away. It's possible to be at the very first elements of consciousness, just awareness itself, and see desire, but not in any way, have this representation:\n\n\"It is **I** who desires\"\n\nNothing like that at all. Just a recognition of a desire, not very distinguishable from something like the recognition that rain is falling.\n\n&gt; I agree that there’s no real distinction between me and anything else, but I still exist and ultimately I’m suffering. That’s all that matters.\n\nRight, well, our semantics here can confuse us. There's at least some kind of cognitive dissonance that should occur if we acknowledge both that: a) the self is an illusion and b)**I'm** suffering, right? I'm not saying that simply taking some drugs once is sufficient to solve this problem forever, but rather that there are things to learn, and our intuitions can easily be wrong.\n\n&gt; I agree that without ego and memory (brain) there’s no me, but there’s nothing either that creates a distinction between my consciousness and ego vs someone else’s. For example, why do we assume that we’re all individuals? Consciousness can be embedded into the universe so that when we think we’re having an individual experience we’re actually have a simultaneous experience. Meaning that me and you right now are the same “entity” living two different lives with two different egos and minds. So does that mean this “entity” will be “reborn”?

So then comes the question how wold one ask for concent for a non existing person.\n\nThe solution to the problem you raise, is to structure a thought experiment where we *know* the right answer, but we also *know* that consent is impossible to ask for. How does one go about the scenario? This doesn't really require any fanciness-- just make the unconscious person comatose. They're in a coma, and someone wants to have sex with the person. The person in a coma can't consent, and they also can't be brought out of a coma. Now what?\n\nIs the argument invalid just because consent is impossible? Here enters the same dichotomy I often bring up-- pragmatism vs. idealism. How one is oriented between these two values systems, will *determine* how one sees the ethics here.\n\nPragmatists will only care about what is possible **here and now**. They don't care about what's \"theoretically\" possible, or possible in principle. They just care that consent can't be given *or* asked for right now, so it's not a valid argument to ask for consent, to them.\n\nAn idealist however, won't care as much about right now, but truth is instead found in what is possible in principle. In principle, the idealist knows that if they can't get consent, then having sex with someone is wrong *regardless* whether or not they can't actually ask for it, or have it given. These points become irrelevant, and the only thing that matters is consent is not given, therefore the act is not okay.\n\nIt's through that second values system, that consent with respect to bringing things into existence is a valid argument.\n\nThe *counterargument* to the consent argument, would be a counterargument to hard antinatalism in general. Which would be a scenario where consent is broken because of some ethical emergency. You can modify the above thought experiment to get the same intuitions, but now we need to get philosophically \"fancy\"(which is to say, convoluted, and silly, in order to get access to some kind of truth about ethics):\n\nWe have the same comatose person who can't consent, and the same person who wants to have sex with said comatose person, but now we introduce some deranged, advanced aliens that are demanding this person have sex with the comatose person because if they don't, they'll do something either really bad, or not do something really good(pick your favorite flavor here, Negative-utilitarianism, or Utilitarianism). So, they'll torture all the children on Earth for a thousand years with their advanced technology, or else. Or they will deny giving us the technology that will transcend our current suffering planet into Genuine Bliss-world.\n\nThis is just how these deranged aliens entertain themselves. So now, consent becomes irrelevant, because you're a moral monster if you don't have sex with this comatose person without their consent, whether you want to or not-- the consequences that these aliens have presented, make you absolutely evil if you begin to think about some comatose person who won't even experience the act you're performing(unless they're unlucky enough to have that condition that causes them to seem unconscious in every way, but actually be conscious). Either way, not only would one be a monster to refuse to save all of Earth's living children from 1,000 years of advanced alien torture, one would be a monster to wake up from this coma and say \"How *dare* you have sex with me just to save all of Earth's children from 1,000 years of advanced alien torture! I did not consent!\"\n\nThe same would be true in a consent-based scenario involving natalism\/antinatalism, so you're free to just plug-n-play with this thought experiment to get the point. Consent is highly ethically salient, and it works in general for antinatalism(even if children who are not yet born cannot consent\/deny consent), but there *could* be exceptions to it, in other words.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626145486,"distinguished":null,"edited":1626146311.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h4zw1tt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oj0u60","locked":false,"name":"t1_h4zw1tt","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_oj0u60","permalink":"\/r\/DebateAntinatalism\/comments\/oj0u60\/how_do_i_aske_for_concent\/h4zw1tt\/","retrieved_on":1652622655,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DebateAntinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2872hd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DebateAntinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

They don't live by human rules, and morality, and don't have to follow human morality either, so stop it with your God and savior complex trying to save everyone and everything and controlling and disrespecting nature\" .. which sounds harsh, but I have lost count of the times I have heard this.\n\nI think this part is deeply confused. There's no such thing as \"human morality\", I think. There are humans, who are attempting to do morality, and human intuitions about morality that are right\/wrong, but there's no human morality vs. lion morality. vs. alien morality and these are all just different flavors like chocolate cake, vanilla cake, strawberry cake. That is a common confusion, I think.\n\nWhat's right or wrong is right or wrong regardless of your species. If it's true that torturing a human child for one's \"own entertainment\" is wrong, then it's true that torturing a young chimpanzee, a duckling, etc., is wrong. Morality *can't* be limited to a species any more than mathematics can. 2+2=4 is true, regardless if humans invented it. An alien race would be confused if they showed up on Earth and said \"We don't care about your \"human mathematics\", we think 2+2=5\". They'd need to demonstrate that 2 and 2 equals 5, and maybe they're right. But they're probably wrong, and the field of mathematics would survive another day. Ethics is identical to this, it's just that few people recognize that ethics functions this way, so we can't get the project off the ground in the same way that we've gotten the project of mathematics off the ground.\n\n&gt; so stop it with your God and savior complex trying to save everyone and everything and controlling and disrespecting nature\" \n\nEither nature has unethical elements in it, or not. There's a fact of the matter here. If nature has unethical elements, like torture, rape, etc-- then this is a moral problem to be solved. Nature can't be \"disrespected\", it's not a person with pride or status or feelings. The aversion to \"control nature\" is I think perfectly rational-- there are many instances where humans exploit nature in ways that are unethical, and this is no surprise, humans are not exempt from nature, they and everything they produce, **are** nature, too. \n\nGod complexes too, is another perfectly rational criticism and worry. The way humans exploit nature suggests this well. So many people suffer from the confusion that humans are somehow *exempt* from nature, so they then delineate between cities, things human endeavors(unnatural, artificial), etc, and then vegetation and wild animals(natural). This is a side-effect of this god complex, there is no magic delineation. If fungi built tiny cities by extracting and transmuting ore from rocks or something, and somehow invented electricity, or moving machines, that resembled small human cities in some way, that would **be** nature. Everything is nature, the fact that many humans think they and their products are exempt is a part of this God-complex. It says \"We're special\". I think that egocentrism is primarily caused by Abrahamic religions and cultures, because these religions and cultures seem to most strongly insist that humanity is some kind of distinct, special creation, and nature was made for humans to exploit(this is stated more euphemistically of course). The evolutionary advantage for thinking we're special, should be obvious. [Lions](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall) would benefit from inventing such self-serving stories too, because it would help justify their behavior. If they had language, they would in fact *need* such fabricated mythology, otherwise young lions would ask, \"Mom, Dad, why are we brutal and callous monsters to other living beings?\" There would be no truly satisfying answer without a simplistic narrative.\n\nSo these are the two real worries in that argument: Controlling\/exploiting nature, and God complexes\/egomania. Humans are thoroughly guilty of both. This is why any pro-active ethical endeavor needs to be highly conservative. We never know if we're *really* right, or we're just inventing a bullshit narrative as an adaptive mechanism for our genes to dominate everything\/each other. Even antinatalism or efilism or veganism or *any* \"benevolent\" meme you can imagine, could in theory, be used as a bullshit narrative to cover up for genetic exploitation. There's no strategy that can be called \"good\" or \"ethical\", which is off the table to be used in superficial ways for non-good or unethical ends.\n\nOf course, none of this has anything to say about the fact of the matter when it comes to nature. People who pretend nature \"running it's course\" is somehow good is obscene or delusional, even though they have a point when they worry about our interfering-- here we should be cynical and pessimistic too.

Some people are completely dead inside after dealing with pessimistic content, so they can't really get much. Others are naturally unable due to psychopathic or similar traits, through no fault of their own. Some smaller number of the former group will actually get *aroused* by this content, and instead relate with the predator, and be totally unable to relate with the victim. Others yet have a kind of pathological empathy response where they're so averse to the content that they just can't watch, and therefore, can't extract any kind of experiential wisdom other than \"BAD BAD BAD BAD CLOSE IT BAD\". I think the most insight comes when one can truly put themselves into the shoes of the animal getting tortured, and just as selflessly as possible, relate to them, in a way that isn't too concerned about ones own discomfort, but instead is experiencing their pain, without some kind of personal reaction like disgust or anger etc., filtering their experience through non-reactive awareness.

So something like an advanced AGI that is so sophisticated it can tell you how events in the far future will unfold, and it tells you that giving birth to a specific child under x y z circumstances, will directly lead to a neighboring alien species being tortured, to instead be rescued, in ways it otherwise would continue to be tortured. I strongly doubt that we live in the sort of universe where **every** birth is a net harm. I think some subset of humans had lives that caused a net reduction in human misery, either due to the things they did or thought or said directly, or due to their causal consequence on humanity.\n\nThe reason I support antinatalist approaches is because we can't know which lives are worth creating, and many lives easily seem to open the potential for net harm, due to all the ways things can go wrong, and the very few ways things can go right. Birth is generally quite a bad gamble. But pretending that they *always* go wrong, is to me, extremist, and strange. I'm open to the idea, I just don't see how that's the case in our world.\n\nIf the above scenario is too unrealistic, we can ground it by saying, suppose we could know that we're giving birth to an animal rights activist.

What if we also knew that this animal rights activist would be a crucial component to exploding the movement's popularity(So like, this would be the \"Martin Luther King Jr.\" of animal rights), and it would be a huge shift in our attitudes as a society towards how we treat animals. If you only *knew* you'd be causing such a birth, and you knew they'd live fairly average lives(in terms of suffering, nothing too bad, some lows, some highs, etc), would causing such a birth be ethical? I would say yes, clearly, if such a birth was, say, the direct causal factor to shutting down countless factory farms vs. not shutting them down, and ending exponentially growing animal torture(vs. not), one would actually be either horribly confused or a moral monster in my book to **not** cause such a birth.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626217243,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h53c2u9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oja2cl","locked":false,"name":"t1_h53c2u9","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_oja2cl","permalink":"\/r\/TrueAntinatalists\/comments\/oja2cl\/what_are_the_strongest_arguments_against\/h53c2u9\/","retrieved_on":1652615255,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TrueAntinatalists","subreddit_id":"t5_2e4o2i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TrueAntinatalists","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

The clinical, official interpretation is confused, but also our own interpretations can be, too.\n\nThe first problem with mental health is *certain* kinds of people dictate what mental health *means*. Certain environments, born of 'highly accomplished' people coming out of academia, in an arbitrary segment of our world. There's always going to be a self-serving element when this is the case, even when it's passed through the filter of scientific rigor. Someone has to inject values for what health means, here, and these \"someones\" are generally similar sorts of people. You're not going to get a ton of richness or nuance in these values.\n\nSo as a result, we have a society that looks at neuroticism for instance, and says \"This is unhealthy\". and looks at low neuroticism, and says, \"This is healthy\". But psychopaths and other disorders can be very low in neuroticism too. At best, this is an insufficient metric for what \"health\" is, because there's just no guarantee that any of these attributes have us arrive at \"health\".\n\nHowever, it's clear that if words are to mean anything, mental health is as objective a concept as physical health. Physical health may be hard to define, and *seems* arbitrary, but this is still compatible with a fluid-objectivity. So maybe thousands of years ago, living to the age of 40 or 50 while still being able to walk and still having your teeth was seen as profoundly healthy, but today it's less impressive, but if you're in unbearable misery and just vomiting relentlessly and leaking infected discharge from every single possible opening in your body, there's really no room for debate-- that's as objectively unhealthy as one can get. If someone says, \"Well in my *opinion*, that person's condition is the quintessence of health\" , then this someone is confused. There are right and wrong answers to health, and there is no reason to think there aren't right and wrong answers to mental health. Torturing beings for nothing other than your own entertainment, is not a sign of mental health in any meaningful sense. You can play semantic games here, and inject certain values, like the values of evolutionary success, but nature itself is [mentally unhealthy](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=176), if such a thing could be anthropomorphized. If nature had a single sentience and had to endure its own insanity, it would slam the \"tap out\" button and beg to make the torment stop, and beg for sanity. This would not be an accident, or a matter of arbitrary preference-- nature would be *right* in diagnosing itself as sadomasochistic, and therefore, insane. If anyone doubts this, all it takes is a quick, consensual, plugging into the torture simulation to change one's mind, if some \"fancy philosophy\" is operative and preventing one from understanding what *really* matters for conscious creatures.\n\nConscious beings needs values to do **anything**. To get off of the ground in terms of solipsism, you **must** value some degree of pragmatism. To have any kind of mathematical success, you **must** value logic. To make sense at all and to have any hope of cohering on what is reality and what isn't, one must again value logical consistency, be open to new evidence, be willing to change one's mind if better explanations appear, be curious, ask \"Where am I *wrong*?\", value simpler explanations over convoluted ones, etc. But there are humans who play the \"values are naughty\" philosophical game. They use values, to then say you can't actually justify values. But we've *already* done it. We've expressed the fact that values are *necessary* to get anywhere. Once this is true, it's as ought-absent as saying \"2  + 2 is *necessarily* 4\". There's no \"2 is added to 2, so... ought we get 4?\" This is the precise way in which people who subscribe to Hume's \"dichotomy\" are tragically confused. Once we get past Hume's confusion, we can at least admit that maximum hell is **bad**. Not bad like \"I think smoked tea tastes *bad*\". But objectively bad, in the most meaningful way \"bad\" can possibly be used. In the way where there's **nothing worse** than this \"bad\". Nothing. Mental health has a relationship to all of this, because if one says \"Hmmmmm, maybe... maximized hell is... *good*?\" then they're not mentally healthy. They've got a *particularly* bugged brain, even more so than the average human. It's the same as if someone were suffering from a visual or audio distortion that simply *was not* there. They'd fail to be meaningfully in touch with reality. \n\nThese are the notions I base a conception of mental health on. Mental health doesn't just mean ability to process physical reality, but it also means a functional reasoning ability. Imagine someone who was the *least* logical person you've ever met. And it's not even that they were simply confused and didn't know what logic was, they could tell you what logic was, but they'd tell you they disagree with logic. From here, **nothing** you could engage with this person on, could be made sense of. You'd say one thing, or ask a question, and they'd answer something totally unrelated. There would be no coherence at all, nothing would make sense, it would be even less intelligible than speaking to a [Schizophrenic](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E1L9Rb0LADg). This would be as *objective* as it gets to not being mentally healthy. What does the *opposite* of this look like? Well things would make *such* utter sense, that mere words from the most rational being in existence, would just be like... someone pouring cool water all over you after you'd had just spent hours in a 110 degree desert. Everything would be utterly intuitive, and you'd grow as a person in real time just engaging with such an individual. This is something like what the epitome of mental health would be like. But if one is not oriented towards mental health, via their phenomenology, then it could have no effect. Such a deeply mentally healthy person couldn't instantly cure someone with Schizophrenia, for instance. They're just not playing the same *game*, it's like one person trying to play checkers with arbitrary, invented, randomized rules, while the other person is playing a strict version of ice hockey.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626221239,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h53jox9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ogzbaj","locked":false,"name":"t1_h53jox9","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_ogzbaj","permalink":"\/r\/areweinhell\/comments\/ogzbaj\/measuring_ones_mental_health_in_hell_is_it\/h53jox9\/","retrieved_on":1652614803,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"areweinhell","subreddit_id":"t5_yzbmg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/areweinhell","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Clearly, we're all human and therefore subject to emotions, and I'm certainly not arguing that \"emotions are always bad\" or anything like that, I'm not approaching this like \"Mr. Spock\" or anything like that. I'm just saying that in extremely important decisions, we don't want emotions to motivate us where, if they were absent, all of our reasoning would be *insufficient* in causing us to perform said important decision. Does that make sense?\n\n&gt; Frankly, even the thoughts that one might have of desiring more life are patently irrational\n\nYeah but I'm not arguing for desiring more life. I'm only approaching this from a \"what is rational to do\" point of view. If it's 100% rational to end one's life, beyond all exceptions, beyond all doubts, I believe the answer speaks for itself, then. There's no more rationalizing that need be done. There's no more emotions that need enter the picture. I distinguish emotions like \"anger\" or \"despair\" and \"survival instinct\" in the exact same category: They all cloud our judgement and prevent us from the most rational step forward, which should be motivated by ethics and the truth, above all else. Emotions, preferences, selfish needs, arbitrary evolutionary mechanisms, all of these take a back seat, in how I'm approaching things. The only important things are: a) What is right and wrong and b) What is true.\n\n&gt; If someone has been suicidal for years, as I have (I've been suicidal my entire adult life, as a point in fact), then there isn't going to be any new evidence that can be introduced which would induce me, in a calm and rational mind, to decide that life was worth continuing. But I do still need something that would enable me to disable the safety-lock that is built in to my psychology. \n\nThe problem with this idea is one can never quite know if they reached this position truly through rationality, or rather some self-serving narrative based on emotions. This is why it's important to be open to new evidence, and make room for our ignorance, because this is a cornerstone attitude of rationality. Rationality often means constant updating, and an avoidance of dogma. If we just say \"Life is not worth living and that's **final**\", then this is a very strong red flag that we're not being rational(I don't think this is necessarily *contradicted* by someone who is in say, intense pain, and decides to commit suicide as a result of unbearable pain-- I support obvious \"Right to Die\" cases like these). Another red flag that we're not being rational is if we state this but they don't act on it-- this suggests cognitive dissonance. Now, it *could* be the case that your description here is perfectly true. It could be the case that it's just this pesky survival instinct and nothing more. But I personally doubt this at the moment. I'm always questioning it, of course, and it's just as important I think to be open fully to something like the most extreme form of pro-mortalism. It really could be the case that our world is calibrated in such a way that the most ethical and rational move forward would be for everyone to immediately commit suicide, however possible. But to me this is an open question that needs to be investigated, and the conditions for what such a world would look like, need to be precisely elaborated, and then critiqued, reviewed, etc.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626311129,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h57zfla","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m68zsj","locked":false,"name":"t1_h57zfla","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h57l4uw","permalink":"\/r\/DebateAntinatalism\/comments\/m68zsj\/i_agree_my_views_are_highly_unintuitive_and_very\/h57zfla\/","retrieved_on":1652605428,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DebateAntinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2872hd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DebateAntinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

No one wants to say \"Oh yeah, no **way**-- I'm **very** low in openness. Open to almost *nothing* here, in fact, heh. Super low openness.\" It's seen as unintellectual, because to get anywhere, you need to constantly be open to previously counterintuitive ideas, openness is associated with creativity, openness is embedded into scientific values, etc,. Being completely closed is akin to a kind of dogmatic way of being. So everyone here has a pretty good incentive to think of themselves as high in openness. Yet, being human, we know our psychology and our models of reality tend to be such that they're way more closed than we'd imagine, just for functioning. The brain is evolved to be somewhat flexible, but often the brain would rather be delusional and consistent, than in touch with reality and inconsistent\/paradoxical. The latter was bad for survival, even though it was \"right\".\n\nSo you have all these people who are either low in openness, or much lower than they thought they were, who are super offended when someone comes along and goes \"Yeah, you guys just aren't that high in openness.

This fact seems obvious, so is that just your low agreeableness or do you *really* believe there's no meaningful relationship in trait openness and a willingness to take something like a psychedelic drug?\n\n&gt; Also, I don’t think most people are aware of openness as a trait and they certainly don’t spend their time arguing about it on the internet. \n\nWhat's the point of saying this? I don't see how this relates to the conversation. \n\n\n&gt; It suggests a certain level of openness to even be discussing these things.\n\nI don't know, if merely typing messages on reddit is a sign of openness, we're clearly worlds apart in how we're seeing openness. You seem to be saying that the presence of *any* openness at all, is a sign of openness. To me that's not a meaningful way to look at it-- it would be like saying \"The behavior of ants suggests a certain level of intelligence.\" It's technically correct, right? But in a conversation where the context is...\n\n\n**very high intelligence** \n\n\n...It's just not appropriate as a real banger of a point to make. The same is true for openness. We're talking about *real* openness here, **high** openness, not merely being not totally paralyzed by the thought of any experience or idea that is novel.\n\nJust read this sentence:\n\n\"Bob just spent the last 8 hours in a bizarre world where all of his identity delineations and frameworks dissolved, after completely willingly, and eagerly, ingesting a substance that he knew *could* produce such experiences.

These things feel good. But they're not good motivations. The people in our world who are most strongly motivated by these things, develop pretty unsavory behaviors, and seek out these things in a superficial way, constantly doing anything just to feel valued, or asserting very strongly: \"I'm important. I'm powerful. I'm desirable. Look at me.\" We all have at least a little bit of this in us as human beings.\n\nThe best thing you can do is just recognize these desires, or these motivations, or what drives them-- insecurities, fears. They will not make much sense if we look at them carefully and attentively. How could it be that we're \"unimportant\", in what sense, even? By what standard? Who gets to decide? Why? This sort of self-talk can sometimes make these worries dissolve or seem brittle, enough to break free from the way they captivate our attention.\n\nWhen you get a thought that says \"I'm just a secondary character, I don't matter, I'm unimportant\", etc-- these are just thoughts. And they arise not because we're perceiving reality or anything like that, they arise because of a complex system that's based around our survival as living things. When we really get too absorbed in our thoughts, it feels like the thought *is* reality. You know like when you're very angry, or very sad? It seems impossible to suddenly stop that state of mind-- subjectively, it feels like it's *us* who is angry or sad. But what we're failing to recognize in those moments, is those states are just thoughts, and we're witnessing them. How can we *be* something we're looking at? Asking that question can sometimes help break the spell of a thought like \"I'm unimportant\" or \"I'm miserable\" or \"I'm so angry\", etc.\n\nTo avoid confusion, I'm not saying anything like \"emotions are not valid\" or \"emotions should be ignored\", etc. I'm just saying that thoughts and emotions can often hold our minds hostage in unnecessary and harmful ways.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626366982,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h5ajbvq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oklb6z","locked":false,"name":"t1_h5ajbvq","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_oklb6z","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/oklb6z\/20m_i_feel_like_a_minor_character_everywhere_i_go\/h5ajbvq\/","retrieved_on":1652600062,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I've read it a second time now and I think I got it. It's not telling me anything I didn't already believe. I don't think the utility of psychedelics involve some kind of traditional, science-couched, math-couched, truth(s). I think that's not the point of taking them at all. If Einstein's entire contribution to science was first settled in some psychedelic trip, he'd still need to do everything he did formally to get those contributions to the rest of us. So the approach here seems strange. Of *course* we can't get *that* kind of truth without our pragmatic models.\n\nWhat people don't seem to understand(in Rationality circles specifically, I mean-- and *maybe* I'm just wrong here and I've completely mis-read this community), is there's immense utility in just *changing*(dramatically) the day-to-day \"I'm me\" experience. People who have *never* experienced this, are really way worse off, in terms of making sense of reality, because there's a huge interference in the form of egocentrism and failure to appreciate how this causes us to fail to converge on reality. Everyone's convinced that their arbitrary representation of reality, **is** reality, and psychedelics take a hammer and just smash that to bits. It's possible to take psychedelics and have that pathology survive the hammering, of course, or the hammer could also fracture some rational faculties, there's no doubt, so there's a lot of room for healthy skepticism of them too. It's just that the fear is often misguided because of a failure to appreciate that first dilemma-- the ego, and the paradox involving the most egocentric people often being the least likely, the most averse, to taking something that has a chance of producing a \"death-like\" experience(or surviving the process with a resistance towards the most crucial lessons).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626369693,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h5aptfz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_okc16x","locked":false,"name":"t1_h5aptfz","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h58t374","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/okc16x\/what_is_slatestarcodex_and_why_is_it_such_a_good\/h5aptfz\/","retrieved_on":1652599680,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It's not an accident that some humans can [willingly burn themselves alive](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c) to protest injustice and not scream in agony.\n\nWhat is reality, what is perception of reality? If we are born, and we just live an average life, never changing our perception, we will be convinced to some degree that we know what reality is. But if we were born in a world of blind people, as a blind person, we could be unaware of visual concepts(forget, for a moment, that vision is hard wired into the brain, and that many blind people can still \"see\" in conceptual, mental terms, for the sake of this analogy).\n\nIf someone told us to drink something, which promised the visual field to emerge for truly the first time, it would be a matter of our traits as people, if we drank the drink or not. Some of us would refuse, and stay blind forever.\n\nOthers of us would drink, and get even more confused, despite being shown a new sensory layer-- the visual field. Others would learn new insights, but forget.\n\nOthers would gain genuine insight. There is a different representation of reality than previously thought. A richer and more *truthful* representation. Blindness in blind world, was a *genuine* ignorance.\n\nWhat would happen to us, psychologically, if we gained this visual field? We'd be humbled. We'd see immediately, unequivocally, how arrogant we were before. And we'd see this even after we lost our visual field once the effects of the drink wore off. \n\nThis is also how we work with respect to egocentrism. Egocentrism is a kind of association phenomenology, where we move through life associating with something which is not real, and only the arbitrary product of mechanisms meant for survival. It has nothing to do with projects that are in conflict with the project of survival. So for instance, there are fields of genuine inquiry-- science, mathematics, philosophy, ethics, etc, but none of these have anything **necessarily** to do with the evolutionary survival drives. These are just coincidences, in that, beings which are survival machines, sometimes stumble upon genuine fields of insight, knowledge, truth, etc. The ego is in the machinery of that \"survival machine\" complex, and the things of value are under the umbrella of those genuine fields of knowledge\/wisdom\/insight. 2+2=4 is true, the idea that \"You're you\", is not true(its subjectively is real, the feeling that \"you are you\" is real, but it is illusory-- 2+2 really *is* 4, despite our subjectivity).\n\nJust like the ego prevents knowledge\/wisdom\/insight in the most deeply meaningful ways(because the most deeply meaningful ways are achieved through a toning down of the ego, which the ego is paradoxically averse to), it opens the door to suffering. All suffering is egocentric. Without certain mechanics of the ego-- mindless thought, self-absorption, insecurity, fear, anger, etc-- suffering is far less captivating. The ego and similar machinery, is what \"cranks the dial\" on suffering. It's possible to reduce the ego, through certain drugs, and through certain training. All this training involves is, increasing awareness. If awareness increases, it exposes the fact that awareness is prior to the ego-machinery. With low awareness, the ego, the sufferer, the desirer, the neurotic, the combatant, the victim, all take center stage in attention, and we feel like we \"are\" these things. All of these states are heavily implicated in suffering, and when these states become brittle and\/or dissolve, the nature of suffering as suffering, dissolves.\n\nIf you're in hell, you want to pay closer attention to the nature of experience, because there's something important to discover. It's a long exercise, but it's worth it. Here's the process: \n\nSit down. Close your eyes. Relax by breathing slowly, deeply, naturally, until you notice you've relaxed. Feel the weight of everything, and the contact\/pressure of your body as you sit. Just recognize the total feeling, it's already there. Did you forget it was there, 5 minutes ago? Of course. Now you're striving to pay attention, so now it's more lucid. You will forget again, very soon, but if you train more and more, you'll forget less and less. From here, all you do is examine the feeling of air going into your nose and\/or mouth, into your lungs, and out. That's it. Nothing more. Simple, but not easy, because thoughts will quickly make you forget what you were even doing. When this happens, you simply recognize the thought, notice the thought, become aware(contrasted by the state *prior* to this, which is \"Lost in thought-- unaware of thought as thought\"), and then come back to the awareness of the breath going in and out, naturally. The breath is the anchor of this exercise. If you get so disturbed that even recognizing the breath seems futile, then simply start again without judgement(or notice any judgement if there is any). Recognize the feeling of sitting. Know, once again, that you are sitting(remember when I asked if you *forgot*? You forgot *again*, and now you're trying to become aware, once again). \n\nHere is where you can get your very first lesson about the nature of the mind, and thoughts. This is the mechanics of suffering, and awareness is, paradoxically, the antidote of suffering. Suffering is being lost in neurosis, associated to it, and awareness is not identifying with neurosis, which reduces or nullifies suffering. Just 10 minutes or so a day is dramatically better than nothing, but the more the better. \n\nThe alternative to this is simply being thrown around for years, decades, in painful thoughts and sensations, or distractions to superficially cope with the painful thoughts and sensations, until they inevitably get even worse and worse, until those methods no longer work-- take your pick. Most people pick the \"pointless suffering and permanent neurosis\" option, because they either don't know about training to reduce suffering and increase awareness, or they don't understand it as a genuine way to get insight into reality\/expose some confusion in perception.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626372349,"distinguished":null,"edited":1626373178.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h5aw5lc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_okelwc","locked":false,"name":"t1_h5aw5lc","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h58tymk","permalink":"\/r\/areweinhell\/comments\/okelwc\/feel_like_my_life_is_a_loop\/h5aw5lc\/","retrieved_on":1652599314,"score":0,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"areweinhell","subreddit_id":"t5_yzbmg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/areweinhell","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Physical training is normalized more or less, but mental training is seen as something religious people in togas do.\n\nBy training the mind, I'm specifically speaking about attention. If the benefits of training the attention rigorously for years were a drug, this would be the most expensive, and possibly illegal, drug on the planet. It would be a \"he who controls the spice\" scenario, because it would practically be a weapon in how useful it is, in the same way exogenous testosterone and other PED's would be game-breaking thousands of years ago.\n\nWe are *profoundly* inattentive, and I can trigger this intuition in you easily right now, by asking you to pay close attention, assuming that you're seated, to the sensations and pressures associated with it. Close your eyes and pretend for a second like your *life* depends on noticing with total precision, every detail of sitting down. If you're standing, notice all the pressure and strain on your feet and keeping yourself upright instead. The point here is *just* to hopefully spark a kind of \"Oh shit\" realization, by now asking you to compare that attempt at attention, with the prior condition you were in, a minute ago. The condition where you practically had no idea you were sitting, because your attention was limited to reading this post, or maybe just half-reading this post, while being captivated by some thoughts, judgements(\"Oh great... is this guy going to tell me to try *meditating*?\"), etc.\n\nOne may think something like, \"Okay great, it was a big difference, but what's the big deal? Why should I care about the feeling of my ass pressed into some surface? That seems unimportant.\" This is missing the point-- which is that our attention is narrow, when it need not be, and this hurts us in many crucial respects. Thoughts just ragdoll us all day long, when we could be far more aware in an effortless way. It's possible to even be so lost in thought, to not even recognize this to be a problem. There's no real practical solution if that's the case-- it's just one of those scenarios where more words or conversations won't resolve the failure to converge(like any debate over something deeply linked to differing phenomenology). More awareness is just like more data-- it's only bad if you can't afford it. A lack of awareness, is a lack of being able to afford more data. It's always bad. It's through a lack of awareness, that the concept of \"distraction\" occurs. This is why attention is probably referred to in the context of a \"span\"-- the \"attention span\". It's a scope, and a scale. It can be precise, but it can also be very wide and encompassing. Does training to improve something like this sound like it could be helpful? \n\nEven in events that aren't your average day, if we're speaking about bad days or days that are profoundly good, but could be far better, a failure of attention robs of us either of solving our most crucial problems in life, or failing to appreciate the most important moments in life as much as we could.\n\nThis is as straightforward as any physical exercise. It can also be unpleasant in a similar sense that any physical exercise is. Unfortunately, there's a difference here, in that if we're suffering from very low strength\/physical fitness, it's much more clear to us that there are benefits to being high strength\/high fitness, but there's no such \"evident\" display with attention. We get immediate feedback that our fitness sucks in fitness-relevant experiences in life, but nothing quite like that occurs with attention\/awareness, because you **need** the thing you lack, to get that feedback in the first place. You can see someone with muscle striations doing upside down presses(not sure of the term) and immediately recognize what's going on, but you can't quite look at a person and go \"This person's mind is like a diamond, like a laser, like a powerful microscope and the Hubble space telescope in one\". At best, it *sort of* makes sense to some of us, but there's not as much room for motivation as a result of an inability to intuit a problem. We also don't feel there's a guarantee that we know what the right exercise is, if such an exercise even exists. I can't offer you much of a solution there other than pointing those problems out. So now, the process:\n\nSit down, and close your eyes. Breathe in slowly, deeply, a few times, until noticeably relaxed. Notice the aforementioned sensation of sitting down, and just relax, and notice the feeling of breathing in, and breathing out. That's it. One is not actually doing anything special here. One is not forcing anything. Just examining, no added judgements, etc. This sounds simple, and it is, but it's not *easy*, just like a bicep curl is simple, but not easy(especially if you suffer from kind of severe muscular atrophy, which is my actual analogy for most of us, with respect to attention. If we all had severe muscle failure, and couldn't even realize it, that'd be analogous to how mindless we are without training, generally). \n\nVery quickly, one will \"fail\" at the point of this exercise, by forgetting they even committed to it(this isn't really failure, it's just a part of the process). A thought will enter our minds, completely captivate us, and eventually awareness will kick in. This is the window to recognize the thought, watch it pass, and return to noticing the feeling of breathing in, and breathing out. Do this for at least 10 or so minutes(the difference between nothing and something is very significant here, like with exercise), for a few months(if the word \"months\" scares you, note how tiny a fraction the daily commitment is out of your life), and the persistence of thoughts and emotions as thieves of attention(Not claiming thoughts\/emotions are to be *ignored* or *resisted*, this is a common confusion) will be profound, and how much more easily one navigates every day life and the best\/worst times, should also be clear(providing you pay attention).\n\nThis is also a method of understanding one's own mind-- to commit to this means to at least imply: \"I'm going to commit to stop potentially pretending that I understand myself, and instead, non-judgmentally observe what my mind is *actually* doing, what my subtle intentions *actually* are, to test and see if I truly know myself, or if I'm merely operating under some kind of self-serving narrative\". One is *merely* asking \"What is the evidence?\" and **nothing** more, so I consider it highly rational to introspect this way. I'm biased here in that I only tend to see this as ultimately beneficial to do, but I can grant that for some people it could be very unpleasant, or even impossible(in practice). Again, no easy solution there, other than stating the problem. I hope you give it a very serious try.

So you have this perspectival problem, yeah? If we pretend we're an ant, reality will be whatever ant perception there is. Reality won't be the endless soup of human endeavors, to the ant. But the ant just doesn't know that.\n\nWe know there's an \"ant reality\", we can account for that. They can't. They can't even escape their little \"Ant Matrix\", because... well... they don't have an ant version of the movie \"The Matrix\", they don't have an ant version of Plato to tell the allegories about how what they're calling reality contains a lot of illusion and confusion, they have no clue that anything other than their own ant phenomenology exists.\n\nBut...\n\nNeither do most humans, to be fair to ants. But still, some of us can account for this and recognize that we're probably clueless too, just like the ants, but a tiny bit better off due to having science and brains that can do philosophy and math and invent computation and do physics, etc.\n\nIf we just account for the fact that human phenomenology is real, and ant phenomenology is real, and there's a totality of \"real\" that gives rise to this phenomenology(but is not necessarily captured by this phenomenology-- it's possible ants and humans are both equally confused about the nature of reality), then we can posit some kind of \"total\" reality in principle. This is not to say we can *understand* this reality, but it must exist. Even if reality is a solipsistic fantasy, and you, reader, is the only thing real, and I'm not a real conscious mind and only a figment of your imagination, then there's *still* a reality that gives rise to your consciousness. **You** know for certain that consciousness is engaged for you at this very moment, it's the only self-affirming truth claim in existence that **can't** be wrong. Everything else can be wrong, but \"you are conscious **right now**\" is simply true and self-supported. If that's true, it's not insane to posit that an objective reality, and therefore, a totality(whether it's finite, infinite, a multiverse, an infinity of onion layers of simulation, just your one brain and no other minds in a single solipsistic fantasy, etc, doesn't matter).\n\n\nThe only problem here I can see is a tiny semantic problem when we're speaking of a reality containing infinities and the word \"totality\", but I think that's purely a limitation of language, and not a real problem in any logical sense. If we had better words\/better understandings of words, saying \"the totality of infinity\" would not sound problematic.\n\nTo clarify, I think it's useful to, in the context of a simulation hypothesis, to say \"base reality\", only for the purpose of saying \"It's from *here* that simulations arise and no prior layer\". In the *totality* of reality, all simulations and base reality is encapsulated by \"Reality\".","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626492392,"distinguished":null,"edited":1626492704.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h5h7rbe","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ohsbcb","locked":false,"name":"t1_h5h7rbe","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_ohsbcb","permalink":"\/r\/AWLIAS\/comments\/ohsbcb\/theres_no_ultimate_reality\/h5h7rbe\/","retrieved_on":1652585959,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AWLIAS","subreddit_id":"t5_2vmwn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AWLIAS","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

So even when we *suspect* that \"You're a bad person!\" could be the next sentence, or suspect something critical is being implied, we go into the stress response, just like the bell and the dogs. But we can know, just by bringing into our awareness, that this is not necessarily the case. This stress response happens *even* when there is no actual criticism at all, or even if the criticism is valid(we *want* valid criticism right? This is in our best interest). When you bring this into awareness, in the *moment*, it can make some, or even all, of the stress, just kind of wash away. Of course this is all easy to say, but hard to do. So if this sounds like something that could help, I'd recommend looking into training \"mindfulness\"(it's just training attention so we can bring certain things like the mechanics of stress conditioning to mind when we need to, and not 'forget' this is how it works by being lost in stressful thoughts).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626552893,"distinguished":null,"edited":1626553134.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h5jv10n","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_om24t3","locked":false,"name":"t1_h5jv10n","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_om24t3","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/om24t3\/is_anyone_else_incapable_of_accepting_even_the\/h5jv10n\/","retrieved_on":1652580358,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Where the pressure to join the military has taken the form of\nconscription, the costs of avoidance have been self-imposed exile, imprisonment, physical assault or, in\nthe most extreme circumstances, execution. Millions of men have been conscripted and forced into\nbattle. Others have been press-ganged into naval service. While conscription has been abolished in an\nincreasing number of countries – at least for now – it is still employed, in one form or another, in over\n80 countries. 2 These include many developed liberal democracies, where the legal barriers to the\nadvancement of women have (almost) all been broken down.\n\n&gt; In those times and places where the pressures on men to join the military have been social rather than\nlegal, the costs of not enlisting have been either shame or ostracism. It may be hard for people in\ncontemporary western societies to understand how powerful those forces have been in other contexts.\nHowever, young men, and even boys, have felt, and been made to feel, that their manhood is impugned\nif they fail to enlist. In other words, they would be cowards if they failed to respond to the call to arms.\nWomen, oblivious to their own privilege in being exempt from such pressures and expectations, have\nsometimes taken a lead in shaming men who they thought should already have volunteered.\n\n&gt; One particularly graphic example of this is the campaign, during the First World War, of British\nwomen distributing white feathers – a symbol of cowardice – to young men who were not in uniform. 3\nThese were distributed even to adolescent boys who were technically too young to register. 4 One boy,\nFrederick Broome, who had succeeded in enlisting at age 15, fought in battle, was returned to England\nin a febrile state and then discharged at the insistence of his father, who produced his birth certificate to\nconvince the authorities. Then, while walking over a bridge in town, then age 16, young Frederick was\naccosted by four girls who gave him three white feathers. He later recalled as follows:\n\n\n&gt; *I felt very humiliated. I finished the walk over the bridge and there on the other side was the Thirtyseventh\nLondon Territorial Association of the Royal Field Artillery. I walked straight in and rejoined\nthe army. 5*\n\n&gt; Even in those few societies where women have been conscripted, they have almost invariably been\ntreated more leniently. Thus, Israel, one of the few contemporary states (and perhaps the only liberal\ndemocratic state) currently to conscript women, is far less demanding of women than it is of men.\nWomen are conscripted for under two years and men for a full three years. 6 While men serve in the\nreserves until age 54, women serve only until age 24. 7 Moreover, married women but not married men\nare exempt. Women are also much more likely to be exempt on other grounds (such as religious\ncommitments). 8 Most important of all, women are not forced into combat and are thereby spared the\nworst of military life. 9 Indeed, they are largely placed in jobs that “free up” more men for combat.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626614569,"distinguished":null,"edited":1626614992.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h5mlze7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ombr5n","locked":false,"name":"t1_h5mlze7","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_ombr5n","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/ombr5n\/does_female_privilege_exist\/h5mlze7\/","retrieved_on":1652574537,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It's not. The worst thing in life is to end up with people who make you *feel* all alone.\" - a character in a movie played by Robin Williams\n\nA lot of the suffering from loneliness comes from resisting it and treating it as necessarily a negative. If you can manage to embrace it, it will stop hurting you. Loneliness means total freedom from abuse and manipulation, insofar as it lasts. Can it get *better* than loneliness? Of course, meaningful relationships are desirable. But they're very rare, so it's worth appreciating loneliness to some degree(however much is comfortable for you, any amount will help) rather than seeing it as only a negative.\n\nAlso, like someone else said, you're not *truly* alone. We're all in this boat together, broadly speaking or narrowly speaking. You're in many layers of invisible communities. People who would absolutely be your close friend in more ideal conditions, but can't. People who deeply relate to you. People who share an interest in what you're interested in. And then beyond humanity, you share the community of sentient beings. Everything that's sentient suffers to some degree. So we're all in this boat together even when it seems like you're all alone, and just remembering that, will automatically pull the weight of loneliness away. It's only through a forgetting of that, or not realizing\/not being aware of that, that loneliness can feel most heavy.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626624281,"distinguished":null,"edited":1626624733.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h5n71mn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_omqv00","locked":false,"name":"t1_h5n71mn","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_omqv00","permalink":"\/r\/CPTSD\/comments\/omqv00\/what_do_you_do_when_nothing_helps\/h5n71mn\/","retrieved_on":1652573309,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"CPTSD","subreddit_id":"t5_2vvid","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/CPTSD","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

This means to say they aren't *free* to choose. We often conflate choice with free choice, which is a system of indoctrination that has allowed for abusers to place the blame on victims, where in total terms, everyone is merely a victim for the reasons stated: No one signs up for this. No one sits there in the void going \"Hmm, you know what? I think I'll take the \"abused as a child\/abuser as an adult\" option\". People are simply the victims of causes which they never consented to-- being born, receiving certain genes, receiving certain people for parents, environments, peer group exposure, opportunities, geographic region, luck, etc. All of the causes that make us who we are, are not freely chosen by us-- therefore no one can blamed.\n\nAnd I'm deeply grateful it is that way. Imagine how horrifying the world would be if people who believed in free will were right. Then people who had the worst hands in life really *could* be told to \"pull themselves up by their bootstraps\". This attitude is not just contrary to the facts of reality, it's also insane. One doesn't get some special medal if they \"did a good job\" and became a billionaire, nor if they devote their lives to doing good(it's certainly **good** they do so, but they can't account for it-- it's not like everyone else is just freely deciding, \"You know what? I'll be not as good, or neutral, or I'll be evil.\"), and one doesn't get punishment if they got deeply unlucky. It's the monster inside us that feels the need to \"get revenge\" on people who, as children, were simply unlucky if we're being honest.\n\n&gt; And we all have a responsibility to look out for people in our surroundings, involving authorities when needed and so forth. Lastly we need to change attitudes concerning asking for help, to make it a neutral move even a sign of strength instead of weakness worthy of shame.\n\nSure, I'm fully on board with this. I think we can still say we \"have a responsibility\" in the sense that we really *ought* to do what you're describing, but in the other \"responsible\" sense as in, \"if you *don't*, we'll punish you for being the dog that doesn't go \"moooo\" \", that part is just completely nonsensical. That is how much of our society is designed unfortunately, and it justifies the farce of the criminal justice system, which does exactly that: punish people further who were given the worst opportunities in life from the very start. If no one *really* chooses who they are(reminder: no one chooses to get a bad childhood and then become a horrible person-- bad childhoods and bad luck and bad genes , these are the causes of bad people, and none of it is signed up for), then punishment simply makes no sense at all.

Something will happen to us, or something will worry us, or we'll regret something. And what happens in the mind, is these thoughts don't function under some rational system. They function under the convoluted and sloppy system that evolution happened to arbitrarily produce.\n\nSo we go about our lives, thinking, pathologically. \"Just great... x is going to happen. I fucking *knew* it. Why *wouldn't* it happen? Of course it would happen. It's so absurd\/unfair\/rage-inducing\/depressing\/&lt;insert whatever your favorite flavor of emotion happens to be&gt;\"\n\nAnd it just goes on. And then it goes away. We're distracted, *again*. \"Oh look, I forgot that this movie was coming out.\"\n\n\nAnd then? The thoughts, of course. Again. A new worry, a new anxiety, new anger, and so on. And this just goes on forever.\n\nMost people are born, and die, under the above system. If there was a loudspeaker playing, connected to our brains, advertising our conversation with no other conscious being than ourselves, and we were the only person with this technological setup, everyone we'd ever come in contact with would be convinced we were insane. But this is the norm for human beings. This is the banality of insanity.\n\nBut, there's good news. There's a way to break that way of existing. The only way to be in that state, is to fail to recognize certain facts about reality. You are not your thoughts. You are not your emotions. How could you possibly be these things? You are the *witness* of them. When you witness them, rather than identify with them: \"I **am** angry\" vs. simply acknowledging the feeling of anger being present, their potential to cause suffering diminishes or even goes away. And this does not involve some lie you have to tell yourself, nor are you \"wishfully thinking\", nor are you bottling up your emotion, none of that. You're just acknowledging what is occurring rather than being absorbed in an egocentric fantasy.\n\nThis is the set of suffering that gets chipped away in the set of endeavors that include ascetic values and practices. So asceticism isn't the *only* way, but it's in the ballpark of ways to fight suffering through introspection. Asceticism I think is the \"hard mode\" version, because it uhh... it definitely can try to forcefully turn off desire, so it's hit or miss, but I guess everything is hit or miss. It makes you strong by breaking you\/punishing you, and not a lot of people are good at tolerating that method. I recommend mindfulness meditation which is just training awareness by observing yourself breathe while sitting down.

It's cluster B so that's alongside narcissism and psychopathy(I prefer this over 'ASPD'), so there can definitely be a toxic element to BPD but I would guess that it's very often not self aware. I think this is even true in general, most people would say narcissists and psychopaths are fully aware all the time and that's just not true, no human being is that deeply in control of themselves.\n\nOther reasons that don't involve manipulation and callousness on the part of the person with BPD, could include: stigma, bad intentions, confusion, ignorance, miscommunication, bias, etc. (possibly but not necessarily from both parties)\n\nSometimes BPD is described as a disorder of pathological empathy, so I suspect many BPD's are certainly not apathetic, but I think sometimes this manifests into a loss of it or even a chronic burning out in cases of extreme trauma\/abuse(these BPD's may seem more like other cluster B's when this happens, so it's all fuzzy and complex I think).\n\nI definitely agree with you that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity, no matter how they turned out based on the cards they were dealt in life. Unfortunately once people make up their minds, they don't really change them. If two people are talking about a third party which one of these two people don't know, and they insist lots of negative things about this third party, then the engagement is just poisoned. The third party could even greet the person they don't know and be cordial but there's often going to be a tension and distrust purely from the stigma, even if there was no evidence of any wrongdoing. From here, the third party could get offended or just seem to mirror this cold attitude, and then this will seem like evidence that supports the original rumor: \"Ah hah, I *knew* this person was bad\". From here, this just spirals into a deeply negative encounter. This is how bad intentions and buggy human brains can collude to produce anti-social outcomes.\n\nAnd from here, there's very often no way to repair this even if the third party is a saint.

So many people on the planet lack the self-awareness to even recognize that a) they've \"got\" something causing them and others misery and b) this thing can actually be *solved*\n\nTo have *both* of these things, is really amazing and rare to the point of being cause for a tiny celebration. And if you're like me and have experienced a lot of unkind people throughout life, then the realization of how rare and desirable a) + b) is can dawn on you extra hard. So if you want, I think it's worth it to just reflect on that alone. I would strongly suggest not to skip that. It's actually precious even if it doesn't sound like it.\n\nAs to \"how?\", it's simple but not easy. It's simple because the mechanics of a), which again is: \"I've got something causing me and others misery\", is not a total mystery. Another good thing. We know it's in the mind, right? We know it's based in thoughts, and emotions. Notice how with each introspection, we are closer and closer to identifying it plainly. This the *feeling* of progress. And it's also why it's not easy, because progress can sometimes take a lot of effort and time. But it's just like... working out, or something you have a recipe for. If you follow the instructions, you can be sure you'll get the result. Also like working out, or doing anything that involves progress, it can feel really good to do. Something to look forward to.\n\nSo thoughts and emotions. From here it's just introspection. *Which* thoughts and emotions are problematic? Which motivations would we not wish to be motivated by? Which values are not, after closer examination, *not* something we *really* want to value? \n\nWhat happens when we say or think something for example, and we *spot* that we're not being honest. Or we're being unkind for no real reason. Or we're being unfair to someone, or ourselves? We can do all of these things *without* realizing it, and this is the bulk of the people on the planet, right? It's just how the mind works in general. But what happens when we're **aware** of a realization like \"I'm not honest in this moment\". Then we can do something, right? It's only by forgetting, or being unaware, that we can do anything we *wouldn't* want to do. And if we make effort to pay better attention(we have to *remember* to do it), we will spot all the things we failed to spot before, and if they're clear enough, then it's just like... I don't know, making yourself a sandwich and you suddenly realize:\n\n\"Wait a second. I'm not even hungry... what am I even doing right now?\"\n\nFrom here, you just... stop making the sandwich, right? The behavior becomes completely incoherent from here, as long as you don't suddenly forget that you're not in fact hungry nor do you desire a sandwich at all, not now, not later. Right?\n\nIf that general situation sounds familiar, then that's exactly what we're looking for.

Both historically and with carnism. \n\nI agree with a lot of the issues your raise in your post, but this part I think may be oversimplified. The easiest way to understand this is with one's own use of technology. It goes without saying that we're *fully* against slavery, right? Yet we know we're \"participating\" in the system of slavery by merely buying the technology, so someone out there who built their own smartphone could walk up to one of us and accuse us of being \"okay with slavery\", yet it's clear that we're not, and it's a complex problem with no clear solution. There's not that strong of a relationship between *buying* the smartphone, and being okay with slavery. It's just not there, right? Our money is not some magical democratic tool that has the power to topple systems of slavery. The real sinister part of the game called capitalism(this is coming from someone who believes that just about every mention of \"capitalism\" as some core issue to humanity's problems only make things worse because of how deep the problem actually is) is it's anti-democratic or unintuitive mechanics.\n\nIf you're trying to, say, topple Apple smartphones with your purchase power, and you start a movement where 25% of now-former Apple smartphone users no longer use them(and suppose their alternative was some kind of built-from-scratch smartphone through some grass roots effort), then Apple can just lower the price of their phones and paradoxically, now the poor who no longer could afford that fancy, convenient Apple product, now buy it, causing net *profit*, and net *increase* in human slavery. Another thing that could be done is simply keep the slavery unchanged, and then artificially manipulate the supply by destroying the product-- companies are notorious for destroying food or other goods this way to rig the system. And it *works*, because the system rewards bad acting and punishes(or fails to sufficiently reward) being ethical.\n\nThere's no reason to believe that we can \"vote\" with our money in some meaningful way. If it were that simple, this would be just a matter of ethical think tanks to optimize purchase voting but that would be a tragic waste of time I think, because economics is just not that intuitive and far too causally complex to manipulate for average human beings in 2021. There's not even a reason to think *actual* voting works either, for that matter. It's been so often demonstrated in crucial political moments, worldwide, but in the US especially, that people who are powerful enough and wealthy enough will get their way.

While I did raised some objections, I don't think I broke any rules.\n\nYou're not alone, I was also banned for the crime of saying the precise *opposite* of what I was accused of saying(they insisted I called someone a psychopath, when I was saying they were *not* a psychopath). They simply ignored every attempt I made to point this out. I suspect that you'll be banned from r\/Antinatalism if you deviate from the status quo somehow, or offer nuanced\/non black-and-white interpretations of Antinatalism, but it could be more than that. I'm pretty sure they could technically ban anyone who thinks *some* births aren't unethical, because I noticed the mod who banned me laid out some new rules about \"no fence-sitting\". Not sure what this even means. Does this mean... \"Only some \"*fundamentalist*\"(in the sense of 'extremist') position on Antinatalism is acceptable here\" ? Anyway, you can read more about my take [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/promortalism\/comments\/oajkqs\/i_have_been_permanently_banned_from_rantinatalism\/h4j1dxg\/) if it interest you.\n\n\n&gt; But anyway, I wanted to ask if antinatalists would be for or against extending lifespans, for humans or non-human animals?\n\n&gt; If the answer is \"no\" because it increases suffering, then would that entail that extending one's own lifespan, through basic survival, would be against one's self-interest (pro-mortalism)?\n\n&gt; It would be especially interesting to hear how Benatar would respond to this, since he considers \"coming into existence\" a harm, but \"death\" a harm, presumably due to the interests of the existing person.\n\n\nI don't think there's a straight answer here, because the thing we should be concerned about is what *kind* of life this is, and this can vary. Life length doesn't really tell us anything ethically. You can have a [very short, brutal life](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez), or live a long life that that was fulfilled, where spite, hatred, egocentrism, were overcome dramatically, and the person became the exact sort of person you'd wish to have around you or populating the planet. Aside from that, there's a real benefit to the scope one gets from age provided that they overcome bad human thinking, like dogmatic thinking, rigidity, aversion to change one's mind when new evidence or arguments are given, ignorance of biases, etc. If we're just extending an 80-90 lifespan to a 150-160 lifespan where those last 50 or so years are bedbound in a state of slow decay, then clearly this is pointless. But if it's the sort of serious life extension that can make someone who looks and feels like they're 30, actually be 80, then that's potentially desirable I think because you just have more to work with, to learn things, to understand the world better, and so on. Short lives are almost by definition ignorant lives, where as long lives are not guarantees of insightful\/wise lives. \n\nNow there's a price to pay in giving everyone simply *better* lives(longer, healthier), because every extended life is only in the physical sense, like a birth in that it takes up space, it inflates population, consumption, and so on, so the only argument I can see against some sort of ideal transhumanist goal is the ecological one. Actually, there is one final idea to raise, but it conflicts with birth ethics themselves, which is the fact that if you're just extending life, you don't gain the benefit of the new sets of genes that would be produced by birth. You're pretty much stuck with the \"working model\" for the century and a half or whatever that you'll be working with. In an analogy: lions vs. antelope. The antelope could extend their lives and reduce birth to try to solve the lion problem. But they're not getting that powerful \"fruits of selection pressure\" effect that can be achieved through reproduction, while lions are, so the lions more easily game the wise old high-longevity antelope. Only way I can see of explaining this point.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626966293,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h64u5vq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oooh12","locked":false,"name":"t1_h64u5vq","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_oooh12","permalink":"\/r\/DebateAntinatalism\/comments\/oooh12\/to_those_who_support_antinatalism_here_are_you\/h64u5vq\/","retrieved_on":1652535990,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DebateAntinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2872hd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DebateAntinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Is it just one of those dumb evolutionary things where the fish who get gills or a third dorsal fin in just the right spot(just making stuff up) outperform those that lack these traits? So for instance, the culture that promotes healthier psychology and openness towards death may thrive in the short term and experience high quality of life, but then the cult which creates total secrecy and taboo of death creates such low death psychology immunity(or, such high death psychology sensitivity) that it ends up achieving certain benefits by keeping the society psychologically oriented in some specific ways that result from pretending like death is not coming. I suspect the death taboo and any associated memes(like the Abrahamic heavens, which say, \"Don't worry--- death isn't even the end.\") create worse, more egocentric humans(which would be an evolutionary advantage over the society next door who is open and realist about death and takes it seriously).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1626969155,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h650q2h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oo957x","locked":false,"name":"t1_h650q2h","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h64hlz2","permalink":"\/r\/promortalism\/comments\/oo957x\/this_is_all_insane\/h650q2h\/","retrieved_on":1652535604,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"promortalism","subreddit_id":"t5_3i342","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/promortalism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

And then what'll happen sometimes is, the rejection or subtle hostility towards that person will trigger some negative response, which can then in turn be seen as confirmation of the original hypothesis.

Be very patient. Have good intentions, and try not to look for confirmations of suspicions-- if you look hard, you'll find them even if they don't exist-- this is how the brain often works.

It turns out all of that just *may* just be propaganda to obscure the actual nature of reality, which is clear if you just look at nature [itself](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall). Life isn't *merely* suffering, which the fairy tales and stories and Marvel movies fail to honestly tell you, our universe seems to be a place where evil wins, which isn't just omitted from the stories, it's the exact *opposite* of what they say. They need you to keep fighting, and believing in some bullshit idea so the cogs keep turning, but the harsh truth is the system is *so* rigged, and the traits of evil people are so overwhelmingly stronger at defeating the traits of good people, that the game in *any* ethical sense seems to not even be about winning, which seems impossible, but about losing the *least*.\n\nJust look at the lions. Who is to say that isn't *precisely* the futility of segments of humanity that want to solve the grip of power? Psychopaths have won for thousands of years. They re-write the history.

You can point to things that *seem* powerful, but you have ultimately no idea what the tip of the pyramid is obscuring when it goes up into the clouds.

How often do you see people just jumping from political extremes? For every instance of this, you'll have tens of thousands who don't. People don't change their minds because our ancestors were rewarded when they were a) psychotic(delusional) and b) confident, while they tended to be punished when they were c) in touch with reality and d) skeptical\/unsure.\n\nThe first one is optimism bias and mystical thoughts. Our reality is a [hellworld of predatory behavior](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=155), and we intuitively just tend to believe \"Hmm, yeah, being in touch with reality sounds like the way to go. Why on Earth would evolution reward insanity? That can't be right.\" But the genes do not give a shit about anything *other* than replication. And it turns out, being insane in hell gives you a survival advantage over being in touch with reality. It'll take care of everything crucial like feeding young, protecting them, learning language, with instincts, and the rest, the monkey can just get zonked out of their mind believing in the wind demon God and the genes are happy. So this is why someone who really believes the \"This is fine\" meme has better odds than someone who *actually* understands that shit is burning all around them and suicide vs slowly burning alive appear to be the only two options on offer. You *tend* to not have kids, if you recognize that this is hell. \n\nThe second one is being confident and wrong, vs. being skeptical\/unsure and right. There's the famous rustling grass example, where you're a proto-human ancestor on the Savannah, and the grass rustles. It could be a tiger, or it could be the wind. If you're inquisitive, high in openness, curious, interested in learning, neutral, scientific, etc-- you investigate. If it's the wind, you live(therefore you have a greater than zero chance of mating, or your already born children have a parent for another day at least). If it's a tiger, you die, which again means no mating, and if you have kids, they could be screwed too. If you just automatically invent some bullshit about demons in the grass and truly believe it, something we'd call completely delusional today, then you automatically run away and get the full suite of evolutionary rewards.

You find yourself conscious, you find yourself in *some* kind of world. You can't know anything much else, but certain things seem more\/less likely. This is our scenario right now.\n\nThere's lots of bad experience(some of it is [*really* bad](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez) ), not just to ourselves, but likely countless more things like *us*. We don't know if: a) this is 'it', as far as consciousness goes b) if things get worse\/better c) consciousness just ceases experientially, at death\n\nBut ethics is in the cards. Some people feel so depressed right now, that they're convinced that they'd push such a button if only they had access. They dream of the perfect drug, and think *this* is the reason they aren't committing suicide. Speaking from experience, this is almost always a fantasy. When is this *not* a fantasy? When someone is in *immense* pain, and one is begging for death in a way that truly leaves no more room for doubt. Extreme \"right to die\" type cases fall into this category. Depression based suicidal ideation is very often paired with a high dis-regard for anything other than one's own subjectivity. It tends to be egocentric, which adds to the paradox of ending's one's life, which the ego does anything to avoid. If the motivation was from a truly self-less, egoless drive, then it wouldn't make sense in the first place, because then it would just be obvious to live on and try to make sense of this world. \n\nIf you're in such immense pain then there are thresholds, the highest threshold is something like bashing your skull against the nearest hard object, with full force, until you die. Clearly among the least attractive ways to die, but it's just a matter of living a certain kind of bad life, for any of us to be brought to that state. Then there's the \"cleaner methods\" threshold, and finally the truly peaceful drugs\/perfect button threshold. What does it mean to reach these thresholds? It means there's no deliberation, there's nothing to think about. You're *begging* for death, once you hit the threshold, your actions are identical to a sneeze. They're automatic. It's like being in a desert for hours, dying of thirst, and you see ice cold water. Not a mirage, real water. It's just obvious. There's no \"Hmm... should I drink it?\" The same is true with these threshold pains. This is almost never how depression based suicide works, which is why we should be skeptical of it and distinguish it from the other kind, because anything ego-based in the mind can be instantly transformed if something is done about the ego. This isn't true with treatment-immune diseases that cause immense unlivable pain, and this is why psychedelics are so powerful for depression. I struggle to imagine someone who is suicidally depressed and says \"I'm ready take my life right now\"(and really means it, they have everything ready, all loose ends tied up, they are utterly and totally ready), taking 5 grams of mushrooms, or a few hundred micrograms of LSD, and the next day going, \"Whelp, let's get this show on the road. That was interesting, but I'm out of here.\" The perspective shift and the ego-reduction is too great.\n\nThe only reasons I would push such a button would be a) Being in the kind of immense pain that made pushing it not even a deliberation(like being in intense agony with no sign of resolution), or b) if my being alive\/existing some negatively contributed to ethics. Otherwise, there's a kind of duty just by being alive, to be ethical, because this could be it. This could be everything there is ethically. You could be one of the few minds in existence who is processing ethics, and it could be profoundly selfish to die if the reasons are merely self-centered when others are suffering immensely. Of course, our suffering matters too, and should be avoided, but the approach here is to become more resilient however possible, if you're lucky enough to recognize that its possible to do it. It's identical to the situation if this were all just physical: \n\nYou're stuck under a rock pinning you down, but your muscles are naturally atrophied. All around you, people are trapped under rocks. What do you do? Well... you can kill yourself by bashing your brain against the boulder crushing your arm or torso or legs. Some people whose pain is severe enough do this, because recovery from the rock seems impossible. Sometimes it is impossible. Other times it's not. Another thing you could do is pick up smaller rocks over and over on a daily basis, and eventually, you'll be able to lift that rock off of yourself. And then if another one falls on you, it's possible you can lift that one off right away, or repeat the same process if it's even heavier. It's possible to even lift the rocks off of *others*, or show them how, by saying, \"Hey... uhh, I know this sounds crazy, but this seems to be rock hell, so uhhh, it could be a really good idea if you took picking up that rock over there, to develop strength, very seriously. You should be doing this every single day. So... you know, rocks aren't just crushing you and contributing to agony in rock hell.\"\n\n\nThat's partly what we're dealing with in existence, except a lot of it is based on suffering and various pathological ways of thinking we hold because we're too confused to even know what our brains are doing almost all the time.

I think people can lean one way( and this is not absolute, we aren't necessarily pessimistic\/optimistic across the board on all issues). Clearly, when people say \"pessimism\", they're talking about some kind of philosophical pessimism, but this is dictated by *traits*, not some magic insight or wisdom or intelligence or anything of that sort. So your disposition really does inform your philosophy.\n\nAnd disposition, is purely a matter of happenstance. It's a way of being right or wrong by accident. If the world is a generally bad place, and one is pessimistic, they're going to be right about certain questions, but they'll be right by accident. It's not that hard to also be wrong by accident once you're operating under a certain trait. So to ground what I'm saying, you can very often see both(in the trait, and in the philosophical sense) pessimistic approaches get you to a accurate looking picture of reality. But it's also true that you very often see the opposite-- people who are pessimistic and just fail to see\/admit positive points. This is why it's so arbitrary and just shooting darts into the darkness, people start with some kind of tendency or axiology and then they generally apply it everywhere.\n\nSo for the purpose that you're asking, with regard to big questions about the nature of reality, or about the direction of humanity, or about the future, etc-- I never think \"Oh, I'm a pessimist, so I think &lt; x &gt;\". It's just about being as realistic as humanly possible. Reality is often negative but you don't want to fall into some kind of trap that every other idiot with an ideology falls into, which we all easily see how it blinds others when they don't share our ideology.\n\nThat aside... I don't think Pearce's vision can ever happen simply because I don't think natural selection rewards the species that endeavors to do what Pearce would like to happen. We could have had this vision two hundred years ago. We could have said, \"Look we've got all of this human power, let's all collaborate now and no one needs to be hungry because we've got such wealth from conquests and access to resources on this planet\". Yet this didn't happen, instead, the human domination game continued. And this won't change. \n\nThe humans who dominate are the ones who are rewarded by evolution, just like every other animal. The kinds of technologies that Pearce sees saving people, will instead be used to enslave\/dominate people, because it's just... a law of nature, that's just how things play out. Evil wins due to the way the reward system works in a game space with no referee, and then the winner engineers the rules, and the disparity between winners and losers grows more extreme, which gives the winners more power, which means they rig the game even further, and so on. This is how humanity has been playing out for thousands of years, and there's no reason to think the winners, who are now oriented through thousands of years of genetic selection to aggressively pursue winning, will now say \"Okay, we're done winning now, let's bring about the utopia!\".
