The reason is, there's a kind of *frustration* and *resentment*(at least with Inmendham), buried in that description that I'd prefer to detach from a purely descriptive effort of what's going on. Clearly, these emotions are understandable, I would never *blame* anyone who was angry at DNA, I can see how it would be frustrating. Anyone who grapples with the gravity of misery that came about from things that are technically mindless, will likely be frustrated. But I actually think a) being frustrated at things outside of anyone's control is not helpful, and b) it'd be a lot worse if this was intelligently designed. Inmendham often conflates two terms: \"intelligent\/smart\" and \"good\/ethical\". He seems to think that for something to be intelligent, or creative, or complex, it should be designed in a rational way that doesn't produce, say, an infinite hell. But unfortunately, evil can also be intelligent. So there's a kind of flawed logic here as well. To really get this point across-- imagine if Inmendham *knew* that there was a God who engineered all of this. His first response would almost certainly be to criticize the whole project as \"stupid\", right? That's the semantic issue I have.\n\n As far as mindless processes go, they produce things that are sometimes more \"amazing\" than what a mind can produce. DNA doesn't get bored, DNA doesn't get uninspired, DNA doesn't run out of ideas, but it can in principle achieve things that, if a mind had achieved, would be pretty bewildering to us at minimum. These are some of the reasons why I don't think the term \"unintelligent design\" perfectly captures what's going on. Maybe something like \"unfortunate natural design\", I don't know-- that's not going to be catchy, but that's closer to what I see. And no, I'm not a biology student, I've just read a few pop-science books to get a bare minimum understanding.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622515871,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h05gztx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_noodzg","locked":false,"name":"t1_h05gztx","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h04a1ip","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/noodzg\/from_an_evolutionary_standpoint_efilism_is_so\/h05gztx\/","retrieved_utc":1627801820,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

It's technically possible to think *anything* because the brain is the ultimate representational architecture for endless absurdity and irrationality and contradictory thinking. What I mean is, if you account for no free will *correctly*, and if you appreciate the implications at all times, then it's truly impossible to be unethical. You have to *forget* the logical implications here, to hate anything. Even here, a fit of rage serious enough can seem to make my claim brittle.

There's nothing incoherent about a table in the context of physics, but there **is** something incoherent about free will, in the context of physics, in a way that is asymmetrical to the mere semantics of \"Table\" conceptually not existing at the small particle level vs. \"Free will\" not existing at the small particle level.\n\n&gt; But in human-scale physics it is impractical to ever predict someone\u2019s actions (the Laplace Demon argument), thus it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to act like we have free will and to structure society accordingly. \n\nWell we don't need to perfectly predict anyone's actions to recognize that free will is incoherent. We hold plenty of things to be true which can't in practice be substantiated(either because it would be too tedious, or lack of technology, etc). We know enough to know that there's no reason to think we can't predict someone's behavior, given what we know about the world. And we already predict it to a shocking degree in scientific settings(where experimenters *know* why someone did x, because they specifically manipulated them to do x, but this someone has no idea why they did x, so when asked, they invent some rationalization\/narrative, often in the context of free will).\n\n&gt; Admitting that there is no such thing as true free will DOES imply that we need to rethink some things about society, particularly in how criminal justice is done. But from his writing, he seems perfectly fine punishing people as we tend to do. The current system doesn\u2019t affect his life negatively (he didn\u2019t get dealt a bad hand in life), and reform might be a net negative for him. So he doesn\u2019t really have an incentive to argue for a lack of true free will.\n\nThis is my position too more or less, yeah, this is what I suspect. But I'm always open to being wrong here. I always find myself asking if there's something I'm not getting here on this subject, because so many smart people seem so deeply confused on this topic that it's always bothering me.\n\n&gt; He may also believe that it is a noble lie to keep telling. IIRC there is some evidence that people do more bad things if they don\u2019t believe in free will. So he may think he has a responsible not to spread that meme. I dunno. \n\nAs a tangent, I get this impression from Daniel Dennett. I've seen him become almost *outraged* at the idea of admitting this to the world, where it just struck me as so strange, because I find the opposite to be true. No free will removes so much spite and malicious behavior from being coherent, since no one *chooses* to be born a monster, and this works whether the subject doing the hating\/spite\/malice\/revenge, etc, is confused about the monster part, or is *really right* about the monster part.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622580569,"distinguished":null,"edited":1622580752.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h08ijaf","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_nq2snw","locked":false,"name":"t1_h08ijaf","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h08gjce","permalink":"\/r\/seancarroll\/comments\/nq2snw\/does_anyone_here_feel_they_strongly_understand\/h08ijaf\/","retrieved_utc":1627797128,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"seancarroll","subreddit_id":"t5_i0nkv","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Lying is not just tacitly normalized(it's generally not some *major* sin like murder, universally), but we are essentially trained by evolution to lie from childhood. We attempt to deceive our parents( I didn't eat the cookies!, etc, until we get more and more complex lies), we try to deceive our peers, teachers(Why didn't you bring in your homework?), etc etc.\n\nWhat this does is, it trains self-deception first and foremost, which is a) the cornerstone of telling the best lies(we evolved this because it's really hard to forcefully fabricate a lie and not get caught-- too many microexpressions in the face\/voice tone\/body language when we're fully aware we're telling a lie, but when we believe the lie, we solve that problem and get to use the super useful but unethical strategy of \"lying\"-- thanks evolution!) and b) the antithesis of self-awareness(obviously, you can't be truly aware if you're constantly deceiving yourself\/interpret things dishonestly\/self-servingly).\n\nThis is how we can *think* we're self-aware(and why if you polled most people, 80%+ would reply with something like \"I have **above average** self-awareness)-- this is how we can know people are full of shit when it comes to self-reporting these things, and why most people simply aren't self-aware.

I'm not saying it's impossible for zero vindictiveness there, but I'm generally not interested in the bullshit signalling that tends to occur post-hoc, I care about what is actually operative at the level of psychology. The dog bites our family member, we're fucking outraged, and we say \"The dog has to die\"(we sugar coat this phrase, of course) as we signal some low-neuroticism \"This is the way it must be\" dominance game over an animal whose life we have power over. And if that dog viciously tore apart our beloved family member, we'll **hate** that dog. We're **not** rational, but we **are** deeply emotional and very skilled at pretending like we're not, because we're also very self-deceptive.\n\nAnd then this gets even worse when it's not a dog, but another human being. The fact that most species moralize each other says nothing about if that moralization is logically coherent or ethical-- many species rape each other too. Many species have a seemingly psychotic disposition to reality. Many species run around in circles because the wetware they're running on is buggy, and this is most evident in human beings.\n\n&gt; I can\u2019t imagine what that would even mean for everyday life. Do you think there is a place in this world for words like responsibility, accountability, and willpower? They only make sense in the context of free will. \n\nYes, I think those words *are* compatible in a no-free will context. And this is not at all intuitive because freedom is so deeply ingrained into our entire semantic game, even with a word like a \"choice\". We simply **assume** that to have a choice, means, by definition, to have a **free** choice. If choices aren't free-- **truly free** , then they don't strike us as meaningful choices, right? But that sort of 'meaningful choice' we *like* to imagine is simply incoherent, and we should talk about the sort of choices we do have. The ones which **aren't** ultimately free. When you buy dessert, you can get cake or pie. That's a choice, and we can keep the word \"choice\". But we can't pretend you truly, and freely, expressed some kind of magic that interrupted causality and injected your free will magic-- that is a fantasy that causes much harm.\n\nThe same is true for responsibility and accountability and willpower. To have willpower really does represent a kind of internal struggle where the pressure to either do or not do a thing is truly immense, but through a ton of determination or virtue or some drive, we overcome that pressure and get the thing we wanted, done. Pay close attention to this phenomenon-- is freedom **truly** necessary for this? I don't think so. I think a robot with an internal narrative running on a perfectly predictable algorithm is perfectly compatible with this sort of thing if we let it loose on an environment, and we're essentially no different, and the same sort of argument can be made for responsibility\/accountability.\n\n&gt; How can we talk about morality at all, which is the study of what we ought to do, if nobody can choose to do anything?\n\nAgain, the semantics are a problem. It's not that we can't choose anything, we can't **freely** choose what we end up choosing. I don't think morality is prescriptive fundamentally, I think it's fundamentally descriptive. Morality has to do with **something**. It's not rocks. It's ultimate value is not best represented by the phrase \"graphite\". Words have meaning, and morality means something in an identical sense that \"2\" means something. Morality exists in a framework, objectively, that is ontologically identical to mathematics. From this framework, you get ought. You *ought* to be logically coherent, if you want to do math well. You *ought* to not burn children's feet with blowtorches for your own pleasure, if you want to be ethical.

There's no reason not to treat a psychopath in a similar way, except more effort towards a) rehabilitation and b) isolation if rehabilitation is impossible. Killing it like the dog seems like not the sort of society we want to live in, where if you get a bad roll of the dice, we just kill you since you don't fit in. That's our current world, except much worse, because currently we *torture* you for a long time on top of it.\n\n&gt; I would be curious to hear you expand on unfree choices. I feel we both agree we can make choices, albeit without unlimited freedom. I still call this free will and you don\u2019t, which is fine it\u2019s just a definition difference. I find most discussions of free will go around in circles because they define it differently. I define an act of free will as an action that feels internally generated and has an element of chance from the perspective of an external viewer. You define free will as the ability to have total freedom from constraints when taking an action.\n\nNo, actually, that last definition is nonsensical to me. When people talk about free will, they specifically express their values in the semantics of the discussion. So an idealist will almost always care about this question:\n\n\"Are we **really**, truly, ultimately free in the most meaningful way possible, while disregarding superficial loopholes like \"a gun to one's head\", but accounting for the most important variables like \"genetics and the social class you're born into**dramatically** directs what you become in life\"? \" ( My values are more idealist than pragmatist-- I care more about what's **ultimately** right. I still care about \"what works\", but it's not my primary value. I disagree that no free will would be some societal downfall, I think lying to people and blaming them and torturing them, and punishing them(Or simply *omitting* help for them), for things they couldn't control, does that, actually.)\n\nA person who is highly pragmatic, just does not care about this kind of question, by definition, since pragmatism is at odds with idealism as a value. So free will vs. no free will at the academic\/intellectual level is a values disagreement, since it's mostly compatibilism vs. (I don't like the word determinism since it really is irrelevant if things are determined or not) determinism. Pragmatists are convinced free will is *good* for us, as a meme, as far as I see it, but they never quite come out and say it. So we get this highly obscurantist sort of debate on the subject even when two intelligent people speak in writing or live debate.\n\n&gt; However I don\u2019t understand your position that we don\u2019t have moral accountability. If I understand you correctly, you say that unfree choices allow us to have responsibility and accountability. I agree. However how can we be responsible without moral agency? If I make an unfree choice to kill someone, am I responsible for my own actions? If yes, then how can I not be morally responsible? If not, then where does responsibility apply?\n\nNot sure what you mean here, since you say you agree that unfree choices allow for responsibility\/accountability, but then ask how we can be responsible. I guess I'll answer anyway: Responsibility is a kind of logic game, when you just brush aside all the semantics. A police officer is \"responsible\" to stop a robbery, because if police don't stop robberies, crimes are committed, police fail to do their jobs, and so on. If a police officer *fails* to stop a robbery when all of our expectations tell us they should be stopping it, that's a problem to be looked into. The relevant systems should be in place to decide how that happened, what should be done to this police officer, and so on. But in an **ultimate** sense, is a police officer **morally** responsible to stop a robbery? No, of course not. What if this person had stroke? What if this person suddenly recalled some trauma they had? What if this person was simply a psychopath, who was tired of pretending to be a conscientious police officer after how ever many years? None of these variables are **authored** by the police officer, they're just unlucky, and we're just unlucky. We don't \"hate\" the police officer, we don't punish the dog with beatings because they mauled the child so severely that it destroyed the child's life and the family's life to the point that they thought death was too merciful. All of those reactions are the reactions of tragically confused barbarians who fail to recognize the simple causal reality of our universe. Would the last example of the police officer's failure to perform be grounds to disqualify them from the responsibilities of being a police officer? Almost certainly. But do we run some kind of rigid system where the first sign of failure(A stroke on duty) results in permanent removal from the police force? I don't know, probably not, but I'm not the person to ask on how to best run a police department. But none of this requires pretending people have moral responsibility.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622657714,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h0cc97e","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_nq2snw","locked":false,"name":"t1_h0cc97e","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h0a70mx","permalink":"\/r\/seancarroll\/comments\/nq2snw\/does_anyone_here_feel_they_strongly_understand\/h0cc97e\/","retrieved_utc":1627791160,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"seancarroll","subreddit_id":"t5_i0nkv","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

To my point, even if it turns out that believing in free will was terrible for the world of human behaviour, it wouldn\u2019t change the fact of whether or not it exists. \n\nYeah but that's actually the position some compatibilists offer(and most tacitly subscribe to). It's those on the other side of the debate who then need to say \"Whether or not free will is good for us, it's irrelevant from the truth of the matter.\"\n\nI go back to all the negative emotions which free will makes possible, because a world *without* those emotions and all the awful fallout, would be an objectively more ethical world. \n\n&gt; Existence is defined as a predictable pattern found in the universe. When we are talking about human behaviour, categorizing behaviours as either voluntary decisions or involuntary actions reflects a useful pattern.\n\nYes, we agree.\n\n&gt; Therefore, the concept of free will is real at that level of description of human behaviour.\n\nNo, this does not follow in any way from the prior premise. The concept of **will** is real at the level of description of human behavior. Ranges of voluntary behavior(handcuffed or not, coerced or not) are coherent in our world. Ultimate moral agency is **never** coherent in our world(**free** will-- which isn't mere will). In this debate, it's very often that there's a smuggling of a kind of freedom(moral blameoworthiness, could-have-done-otherwise-ness), that simply does not exist.\n\n&gt; Let me know if I understand you correctly: you don\u2019t believe moral responsibility exists. Criminals or or police officers are not morally responsible for their actions any more than a dog.\n\nIn an ultimate sense, yes. This seems obvious when one simply takes the physics and biology of our world into account.\n\n&gt;  Morality is the framework that directs what moral agents ought to do.\n\nNot exactly, I don't like that description. It's clearly deeply related to that, but to me that's like saying \"Mathematics is the framework that directs what outcomes we ought to get when we make various integers interact with each other\". Mathematics simply describes the behavior of numbers, shapes, and so on. Ethics describes something to has to do with making reality not a hellworld for sentient beings. There are right and wrong answers to how numbers interact, \"2+2\" does **not** equal 7(objectively), and there are right and wrong answers for how sentient beings should interact if they don't want a hellworld: \"Relishing the suffering of a child as you apply a blowtorch to its feet in your dungeon\", is **not** ethical(objectively). \n\n&gt; Then I want to ask, in such a world that lacks moral agents, what is the thing that morality applies to? \n\nUltimately, math applies to the ontological totality, in principle, of numbers, shapes, and so on(whether humans recognize 1% of it, or 50% of it, or get the whole thing wrong, is irrelevant). Ultimately, ethics applies to the ontological totality, in principle, of hellworld inducing behaviors, at the level of both the subject(first person perspective) and the object(gods eye view), simultaneously. There's an objective gradation here identical to 2, 3, 4, 5, and so on, but for our basic human ape brains, it's just not quite so straightforward. So there's a scenario where we're all in the Matrix, but we're all experiencing bliss, and no one is suffering, but in objective terms, conscious robots that can be called \"psychopathic\"(in that they are wired to cause sentient misery), farm these beings for some vital organic substance. You take these robots away, and the hellworld gradient changes. You add suffering, and the hellworld gradient changes the other way. Since we're in a physics engine sandbox, there are moves in principle that lead us towards\/away from these various gradients. Example of a move to gravitate closer to a hellword: Aim to double the child torture and sexual abuse on planet Earth. \n\nAdmitting how straightforward this is, is how we can be reasonably confident that ethics is ontologically identical to math. It's just that we're able to run the same kind of experiment, mathematically, but get instant verification, so it's very difficult for anyone to be skeptical towards the ontology of math:\n\n\"Well, how can you *know* 2 and 2 make 4?\" Well, we just do the math, and show them. We run our computers, we build and operate space ships, and so on. But when someone asks:\n\n\"Well, how can you *know* enforcing the rape of all children on the planet would be *bad*?\"\n\n...we can't actually verify that as easily, so it sounds like some kind of valid philosophical skepticism, when it's not. We build entire heuristics around this kind of thinking just to make it even harder, because the incentives for an unethical world are too great for some people on our planet(the people who benefit from unethical strategies the most).\n\n&gt; Suppose you were looking after a pack of dogs. Is there any point in telling the dogs that biting is bad?\n\nOf course. Biting is bad, and we don't want a world where things just frivolously bite us(or us them, whether we're able to understand that or not). We probably don't even want a world where something bites us *even* when we're the asshole-- that just leads to more tit-for-tat barbarism.\n\n\n&gt;  The dogs who will bite anyway are not morally responsible. The dogs that don\u2019t bite are not morally responsible. Does a system of morality exist for a pack of dogs? \n\nRight, neither are morally responsible, but they're morally implicated because they're sentient things bumping into other sentient things. People in this debate(I'm not trying to imply you do, I genuinely have no idea) often have this kind of non sequitur kind of intuition that goes: \"Well if they're not morally responsible, then all talk of morality is somehow off the table\". This is how the human brain systematizes many things, because black and white thinking has been crucial to our evolution where we had to make snap decisions. Deliberating on what degree of \"badness\" the tiger running at us was, meant simply losing the evolutionary game, even if it was technically a genuine inquiry.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622672771,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h0dbf3h","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_nq2snw","locked":false,"name":"t1_h0dbf3h","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h0clck0","permalink":"\/r\/seancarroll\/comments\/nq2snw\/does_anyone_here_feel_they_strongly_understand\/h0dbf3h\/","retrieved_utc":1627789596,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"seancarroll","subreddit_id":"t5_i0nkv","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

We also need responses to sociopathic(synonymous almost always with \"unethical\") behavior, but none of this is important in the context of \"punishment\" or pretending like people could have done otherwise.

The rare case where one might exist is if one moral feeling contradicts another and you had to choose.\n\n&gt; Sean and others are moral constructivists, meaning they believe our moral frameworks stem from our moral emotions. If humanity did not feel bad about a certain action, we would not have a moral taboo against it. \n\nThis is a very interesting and thought provoking point. I'm certain that some people will easily be convinced by this sort of argument, because it's seems to me to be very intuitive and it seems logically clean at face value. But there's a problem here I think because you can use this identical sort of argument for mathematics. Let's try it:\n\n\"I believe in mathematical constructivism, meaning I believe that our mathematical intuitions stem from our ability to process logic. If humanity did not operate under logical frameworks(Where 2+2=4 made zero sense), we would not feel that 2+2 made 4, for instance, but perhaps could be certain that 2+2 made 5.\"\n\nIt's possible to essentially \"deconstruct\" anything, in this way. But ultimately, whether we're speaking of math or of ethics, our words **need** to make sense, no matter how they make us feel, or how they strike us, and this is true of both ethics and math. Ethics has to do with sentient beings, it doesn't have anything to do with unconscious rocks(unless of course, those rocks are in *some* relationship to sentient beings in context). There's more you can add here, but these are objective descriptions of what ethics is, irrespective of what humans \"feel\". If we felt **great** about child rape, because say, there was some weird cultural norm that mutated thousands of years ago, and the tears of children who were being abused brought us nothing but joy and spiritual ecstasy(this would be a deeply psychopathic culture, clearly), this would not suggest some kind of *brittleness* towards ethics, that ethics was *merely* constructed, or arbitrary. It would mean that humans are simply confused by their feelings. We *know* people are confused by their feelings, so when one argues: \"Ethics are *merely* about feeling! Therefore, ethics are arbitrary!\", it's not a thoroughly thought out idea.\n\nSo it happens to be that many of our ethical intuitions do intersect with moral truth, so for instance, you or I would recoil if we saw a person being tortured maliciously, but this is purely coincidental, and not suggestive that ethics is arbitrary any more than math is arbitrary. It's possible of course, to be ethically confused, like I said earlier. Again, we could be racists in the year 1800, in the United States, and feel deep satisfaction upon seeing the lynching of a dark skinned person, but again, this \"feeling\" has no relationship to ethics. We'd happen to be ethically wrong here, and for the wrong reasons. Objectively. What we feel is either right or wrong, but it's right\/wrong by accident unless it's deeply thought through. What's **actually** right, is deduced through logic, and the logic that comes from examining how sentient beings suffer or thrive. This is why this style of argument is just not very convincing for me. You need not appeal to **any** emotion to coherently arrive at ethical ideas.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622686732,"distinguished":null,"edited":1622687391.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h0e3mqx","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_nq2snw","locked":false,"name":"t1_h0e3mqx","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h0ds8wx","permalink":"\/r\/seancarroll\/comments\/nq2snw\/does_anyone_here_feel_they_strongly_understand\/h0e3mqx\/","retrieved_utc":1627788354,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"seancarroll","subreddit_id":"t5_i0nkv","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

If one doesn't understand this, then the other person will *simply* seem wrong to the point of being delusional, like in your Zeus\/Athens analogy.\n\nIf you do understand the value difference, then you see two different approaches to getting at the same end point of reality. What I'm actually interested in, is which value system gets us to \"the goods\" faster, because different things matter to us. Clearly, right? If different things matter to us by definition, due to us *simply* being different people, then even if we're using the same rules of logic, your \"logical disproof\" will appear empty to me, and my argument against it, will appear empty to you.\n\nI could easily see you to be just as delusional as the Zeus\/Athens person because they stuck too rigidly to some arbitrary point of humans attempting to use axioms, but I don't(i technically believe you are wrong, yes, just like you believe I am wrong), but I think your strategy eventually gets to things of value\/truth. Here's the best way I can explain to you just how dramatic the difference can be:\n\nOne could commit strongly to pragmatism, science, rationality, rules, right? Far more strongly than anyone ever has. We assume this can only be good, right? But it's possible it's bad, too. It's possible that simply loosening the rules, gets us some where even better. Or gets us to exactly where we were going, but gets us there faster. These are just different systems for navigating an entropic gradient like ours, where it's far easier to be wrong about anything than be right(both because of the substrate we're in, and because our reality processing wetware is corrupted by natural selection, because 'bugs' were more adaptive than things that would strike us as 'features'. The bug is very often the feature, and the feature is very often the bug.). Science lays out just one strategy for navigating something like this. The antithesis to this would be like playing the lottery. We could just get every scientist on Earth today, have them spend 8 hours every few months dropping acid together, writing down their experiences in the context of their educational background, and working off of that data. This would be the antithesis of science, right? But it's a real potential shortcut to getting something of value that may take a thousand years of slow, rigid pragmatism. Once you arrive at the truth by sheer accident, by sheer roll of the countless-sided dice, the mechanisms of logic will over take it, no matter how you got there. If there's **any** one thing to understand about what I've written, this part here, is it. This is the most crucial part. \n\nSo to ground that important part a bit more, imagine someone's... in the reality where malevolent aliens *really* are manipulating the events on Earth, and the human species. And no one knows, okay? This hypothetical reality is just about humanity being sitting ducks. And they're doing science, of course, business as usual. But they'll never actually arrive at \"Aliens are manipulating us\" if they just do science. It's just too slow and too pragmatic. If someone in this reality is a schizophrenic, or experiences something we'd call \"psychosis\" as a result of something like psychedelic drugs, then it really doesn't matter if this person arrived at reality through rigorous science or through a psychotic episode, because once you identify something like \"Aliens are manipulating humanity\", the evidence for that \"clicks\" in your head, and you're free to do science from there. But if we're not that schizophrenic, we'll never even get to that position in the first place. Of course, schizophrenics are wrong just about **always**, and this is a bad strategy for every day life. But it's not *always* bad, and pragmatists are the people who are least able to appreciate just how strongly you can \"win the lottery\" with other value systems, or other modes of getting to reality.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622735266,"distinguished":null,"edited":1622736353.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h0gaecb","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_nq2snw","locked":false,"name":"t1_h0gaecb","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h0g8z5u","permalink":"\/r\/seancarroll\/comments\/nq2snw\/does_anyone_here_feel_they_strongly_understand\/h0gaecb\/","retrieved_utc":1627784833,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"seancarroll","subreddit_id":"t5_i0nkv","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Just notice that I even wrote such a caveat in the first place, where it would be out of place if it appeared in the reverse scenario. This is not an accident, and says something important about what is socially acceptable discussion in terms of gender issues.\n\nEveryone should support everyone, regardless of identity, because of the crucial fundamental importance of the only identity that really matters: Sentient creatures. As long as you're conscious, you can suffer, and you matter.\n\nThat out of the way, men were historically seen(and were, due to muscle mass\/bone structure) the most rugged sex, so they were the ones who did most of the sacrificial heavy\/dangerous labor. They were the ones who were sent to the countless, endless wars, to die.\n\nThe ratio of homeless men to women is something like 7:3 in the U.S. Men live shorter lives, and are gaslit by society because we're more violent(we are), which is only superficially true, I think. I think both genders can be pathological, but male pathology is overt, where as female pathology is covert, so men get a disproportionate amount of criticism because their worst behaviors are in plain sight, in big \"show-y\" displays, where are women have evolved to be more subtle, for obvious reasons.\n\n*(Edit: If you doubt this, ask a woman who was bullied by other girls in middle school or high school about their experience-- it's not a coincidence that in the advent of social media, suicide for teenage girls shot up 75%, where as in boys, who had pro-social outlets like video games, was \"only\" up 25%-- young girls can be even more callous than men in the way they treat those of lower social status)*\n\nTo really put this into context, our traditions and myths are rife with male sacrifice, much of which comes from Christianity. It's no accident God's **son** was sacrificed and is supposed to suffer and bear the burden of all the evil in the world. Imagine how perverse this would be, if you're a woman reading, if God sacrificed his daughter in this way. It's vomit inducing, when we flip the gender, but even men have tacitly accepted that this is simply the status quo on Earth-- men are disposable.\n\nThere may be evolutionary reasons for this. It may be the case that a (potentially) caring mother was simply a dealbreaker for a child, where losing a mother's care really meant losing the evolutionary game in a way that losing the protection of the father was not as often bad, or sometimes could have even helped(if the father was particularly rotten-- nature hasn't found much of a solution for rotten mothers, alas). But evolution is known for countless strategies that are deeply unethical. There's parasitism, there's rape, and the list goes on and on. We shouldn't accept male sacrifice just because it's natural, or it has been the status quo for thousands of years of warring empires seeking to dominate the world(a collusion of both evil men, and evil women).\n\nNo one should be \"sacrificed\", not men, not women, not animals, and so on. The goal should simply be to turn the dial down on sentient suffering, both by making interpersonal narcissism less possible, and by making global, macro narcissism less possible(if such a thing is even possible).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622759165,"distinguished":null,"edited":1622759764.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h0hv4yg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nrla0o","locked":false,"name":"t1_h0hv4yg","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_nrla0o","permalink":"\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/nrla0o\/a_message_for_the_loney_men\/h0hv4yg\/","retrieved_utc":1627782308,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

It's far more likely that such a move would be co-opted by bad actors and then used as an excuse to euthanize whatever set of the power structure in any given moment deems undesirable, and then some kind of re-population would likely occur. It's just so easy to sabotage something like this, and humans are very often motivated by evil(simply recall the horrors of human history which you were almost certainly unaware of for some set of time until an attempt was made now to bring it to your attention once again). This is why I don't think paths to human extinction should ever be seriously attempted at this stage of humanity, when all signs point to a very ambitious power hierarchy that has intended to proliferate humanity through human sacrifice for thousands of years, and only shows signs of cranking the dial.

I mean that the desire *itself*, is either rules(in general, or specific rules \/ rule-sets), or no rules. If you want to use \"Desire\" instead of \"Orientation\", that's fine, I just think the word orientation is better because it captures a tendency of behavior\/value system that isn't necessarily linked to emotion. The lungs for example, don't *desire* oxygen(but you *could* say so, if you're being poetic or something), but they **are** *oriented* towards oxygen. The lungs are *inclined* towards a relationship with oxygen. (notice how you were mostly unaware of your lung function today, and they operated just fine without any desire from \"you\"-- your consciousness didn't spend much time going \"Ah, I desire oxygen, now it is time to breathe\"-- your lungs simply operate) This is how I look at people, as well, when it comes to values, like \"Follow rules\/Follow certain rule-sets\".\n\n&gt; The point is that there is no such thing as restricting your Will, which is something I thought you were saying in your OP. Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nI see what you thought I was saying, no, I don't believe in free will, therefore I don't believe in  the kind of \"restricting your will\" that you're thinking about here. When I'm describing sentient beings in our universe I'm just describing robots who can make choices, but can't make free choices. I'm just describing modes of \"Will\", where one kind of will is highly conservative and systematic and neat, and the other kind of will is highly sloppy and unconcerned but also more creative, and saying that in our specific environment here on Earth, one tends to be better(very generally speaking, not in any absolute sense). So if someone could write 1 book, but spend a life time obsessing and perfecting it, or write 50 books in a way that would bring them disgust in how unconscientiously(relative to the \"1 perfect book\") they were written, it's better, generally, to write 50 books.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1622832291,"distinguished":null,"edited":1622834057.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h0lkc3r","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nquxcb","locked":false,"name":"t1_h0lkc3r","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h0lhwo0","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/nquxcb\/ligotti_about_the_source_of_his_work\/h0lkc3r\/","retrieved_utc":1627776484,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

The way we get confused here is you could say anything is linked to desire when you're talking about sentient beings, but if your explanation explains everything, then it doesn't explain much, because it's completely devoid of nuance.\n\n\"Knitting is, at it's core, an illusion, because desire is at its foundation\"\n\nWhen we speak this way, we've reduced reality to such a degree that we've lost almost all nuance\/meaning.\n\nYes, I mean the actual lungs themselves. They're oriented towards oxygen(so are we, as beings whose consciousness depends on oxygen-- we go unconscious when oxygen is deprived), but we're not identically oriented towards oxygen. The lungs don't \"desire\" oxygen, and neither do we, necessarily. You're not desiring oxygen all day, when we're speaking about you, the consciousness. Your lungs are taking care of the oxygen problem and you occasionally notice that you're breathing, but generally, everything's just unconscious for you to the point that any thought of desire is purely speculative. To say \"I unconsciously\/subconsciously desire oxygen\" is premature, because we just don't know.

There's something of a tragedy to pessimism itself, where if one really comes face to face with what this place is, it destroys the mind due to the way it grabs the attention. It destroys the mind with what is mostly true, in a very subtle way. Here's a more numeric example for people oriented towards numbers:\n\nSuppose our world is 95% hellscape, and 5% genuine good(I'm a cynic who doesn't believe in this concept, but to argue against this point would be to miss a much deeper point). We look at this, and generally come to the conclusion that in the context of a 95% hellscape, there is no good, there is no silver lining, and it's simply 100% hell. From here, we're far more in touch with reality that someone who is blissfully ignorant of what the nature of the planet they're on is, or someone who is delusional and thinks life is mostly good, and so on, but we're *still* slightly delusional about that 5%. From here, we actually pave the road towards a real version of that 100% hell, in that tiny margin of error.\n\nSomeone may respond to this by truly doubling down on the 100% hell version, but to me it's pitifully easy to think of a silver lining at any given moment. 1) It is assumed that you are currently not screaming in pain, begging for opiates at this specific moment. You are not [here](https:\/\/youtu.be\/KDf_aL_7QHI) or [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hCRpuTRA7-g). Yes, these experiences do exist, to a small degree. Yes, most of us are out of touch with this reality, and this falsely colors the nature of our world. This is hellish, and this is bad. But it *could* be the case that this experience is doubled, quadrupled, or experienced a million-fold. That would be **dramatically** more hellish, and that's not debatable. \n\nIs this to say that life is somehow worth it because only a few people suffer with some of the worst agony possible compared to most people, or all people? No, of course not. No amount of pleasure in a vacuum is worth the torture of even a single person if none of it needs to exist in the first place. But it's still possible to be so focused on the negative that there's a kind of egocentric delusion about how bad reality really is, and it's obvious why this is: When something very seriously threatening enters our awareness, as animals, and we can't run or fight, our brains do everything possible to navigate this problem, and that navigation is almost never in touch with reality because all survival strategies are by definition psychotic in that they either downplay hell, or exaggerate hell(upon seeing a 95% hell, it would benefit a sentient being to hallucinate a 100% hell, purely for survival reasons. This would be adaptive in the short term, but maladaptive in the long term because it would close the door to tiny movements away from hell).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1623002634,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h0tgugg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ns3dxc","locked":false,"name":"t1_h0tgugg","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h0q5gkl","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/ns3dxc\/for_all_optimists\/h0tgugg\/","retrieved_utc":1627763258,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

The reality is, the world is quite a bad place, and this badness is just... utterly obscured. It's hidden from both children and adults, it's lost in misleading representations of history, it's downplayed via attitudes that range from cruel or sadistic, to apathetic or blissfully delusional.\n\nSo if you have any feeling in you, that's something like \"It's *always* wrong to be suspicious or paranoid\", I just want you to know that is not *inherently* wrong or worthy of shame.

Now, we only force them between homelessness and slavery, in a pretty clear dystopia. Any social system where large numbers of people are told they're unworthy, or stupid, or unskilled, or undesirable, is a dystopia in meaningful terms.\n\nIf you were the king or queen of such a dystopia, it would benefit you to create memes around the taboo of suicide. If religion were the focal point of everyone's life, then you'd probably invent a meme that says, \"If you kill yourself, the creator of the universe will sentence you to eternal torture.\" You need every peasant to work and suffer. Every soldier to fight and die. You are at war, with the other kings and queens, and everyone other than your dynasty is a pawn. This has been the dark reality of history for thousands of years.\n\nIf such beliefs fell out of fashion, then you'd need to have a field of psychiatry that told you there was something wrong with you for wanting to die if your life was nothing but a progressively worsening hell. Yet we seem to want to force **everyone** to live as long as possible, everywhere. How odd. One possibility of this is the knowledge that forcing and maximizing suffering, has large economic incentives. Humans who aren't psychopaths want to alleviate the pain for their suffering friends and family. They buy bus, plane tickets. They consume more. The drug consumption becomes immense, both for the people adjacent to the sufferer(which is less obvious), and obviously for sustaining the suffering individual in the form of various painkillers, or hospital upkeep(involving doctors, nurses, injections, all the various medical paraphernalia and maintenance, hospital staff). All of this is of course, very pricey. Suffering is big money. So where this is an incentive for profit, the most evil people (which sit atop of the world-- you don't get there being utterly committed to ethics-- these people are out-competed) will abuse it.

This is the burden you need to demonstrate, because without recollection, there's no coherent extension of identity. If a mad scientist tells you they're going to torture one of two people, but you must choose who, because if you do not, they will torture *both* people, and you decide between these 3 options, but then the mad scientist wipes your memory completely so you wake up with no idea what's going on, and are now suffering some consequences(let's say the family member(s) of the person you chose to suffer are now mad at you, and confused enough to not recognize that you were forced to do this awful thing so they're enacting revenge against you), then there's no coherent way anyone could say \"you\" are now morally blameworthy. You're free to call **everything** you. The most extreme version of monism simply calls the totality of ontology being one big \"you\". But in terms of granularity this is just one extreme position, and there are other deeply meaningful(and deeply **un**meaningful) representations and gradations of \"you\".\n\n If we assume moral responsibility is a coherent idea(it isn't, but let's assume it is), then the person these people are trying to \"punish\"(what \"you\" were), is now not the same person in a morally crucial way. You'd encounter the same problem if you kept memory intact, but were instead given a drug that triggers a mind-altering phenomenon that increases your sadism, prior to making the mad scientist's choice. It would make no sense to say \"you\" made the choice(and the choice here likely means to choose \"nothing\", since due to sadism, you'd likely pick the choice which causes both people to be tortured). When the drug wears off, if you're like anyone else in the same scenario, you'd say \"I would never have done that!\"-- and you'd be right. You wouldn't, and \"You\" didn't. These are just a few ways in which personal identity, the thing you call \"you\", is brittle. On this basis, even **if it can be said** that something caused you to exist(You disliked the word 'forced', but this is precisely what is happening. Anything causal is forced, by definition. If you *weren't* forced, a meaningful representation of **you** would have had a say-- but this idea is incoherent.), it simply wouldn't be a thing one could call \"you\".\n\n&gt; You cited the injustice as a reason to doubt my statement. My four\nnumbered-points were answers to the matter of injustice.\n\n\nIt's one question whether or not any of this is true or false, but it's **another** question whether this is just. You appear to be confusing my pointing out the tangential idea that even **if** true, this entire scenario would be unjust, with the argument: \"It is untrue **because** it is unjust\". This is what I mean by your assumptions are wrong. If you re-read my post, nowhere will you discover me saying: \"It is untrue **because** it is unjust\", it's simply the case that *if* true, it is unjust(due to the incoherence of moral responsibility in light of no persistent memory).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1623452819,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h1gjnnb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nphgiz","locked":false,"name":"t1_h1gjnnb","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h1geqoq","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/nphgiz\/whats_your_opinion_about_gnosticism_and\/h1gjnnb\/","retrieved_utc":1627721764,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Water and Sand would matter ethically beyond its relationship as \"stuff\" that impinges on sentient things(drowning in water is bad, a painful bit of sand in your eye is bad). A universe of nothing but rocks has no moral salience, it's a universe with a null state of wellbeing\/suffering. A universe with sentient things is a world where ethical problems exist(and ethical\/unethical actions exist, because these words have a real meaning, in the same way the number \"2\" has a real meaning, and when added to \"2\", results in \"4\", but not \"5\").\n\nEvery sentient thing shares something in common: They're conscious, and they want to be happy. So as sentient things, we should recognize this, and move through reality in a way that doesn't cause harm to sentient things. This is *very* difficult to do as humans, because humans have a lot of unethical drives in them, as a result of what happened to arbitrarily win various games which involved controlling space, resources, and reproduction.\n\nBasically, the humans who got to reproduce(and had all the conditions that maximized reproduction, resources, space, power) were running with strategies that can be described as \"evil\" or \"unethical\". Since there is no referee in evolution, only the ground rules of physics, biology, game theory, and so on, then perfected cheating is what \"wins\". We are currently in this unfolding game state where this is still the case, and this will not change, which tells us that evil *ultimately* wins here.

Is it not clear by now? Do you think all the fictional works of dystopias are *predicting* or warning something? No, they're literally metaphors for reality as it is. They're sublimation-- the act of creating proxy art of reality because expressing that reality is either taboo, depressing, unsexy, psychologically destabilizing or otherwise unmentionable.  You can't say \"We're in actual hell\" if you're in North Korea. In a very similar way, in the \"Free\" West, you also can't describe what's going on in a straightforward way. Everyone is an adapted zombie to our hellscape, which they are groomed to be from childhood. Childhood is full of many tears, and much fear, and much frustration. We kill a child's spirit, curiosity, motivation, esteem, hope-- that's the system working as intended.\n\nBy the time you're an adult you're no longer surprised by how the world works. You've been exposed to so much violence and malicious attitude and mind-numbing or psychopathic content that you've been groomed into your role in this zoo, and when someone says, \"Hey uhhh... you think this is like, Hell, or something?\" You don't even bat an eye, because you're *already* coping in some way-- so if you're coping in a way that can't face the reality, then there's no way for that reality to break through to you. You'd just get an allergic reaction. But the reality remains: We are all in a hell governed by psychopaths, and that's how it has *always* been. Rulers entertained themselves by throwing people into hollow metal bulls and setting fire under the metal, roasting them alive, thousands of years ago. Rulers of psychopathic armies and dynasties fought for ownership of planet Earth, for thousands of years.

Everywhere you look. It's not *simply* one empire or another-- it's **every single continent** on planet Earth. Humanity is mentally ill, because that's what happens to win evolutionary games. Everything you were taught as a child, all the stories, where there's a good guy and a bad guy(notice: This is how just about **every** story runs), is a lie. It's the *opposite* of this. Evil wins on this planet, every single time. And if you manage to overthrow evil? It means you're an even bigger evil, because it's impossible to beat the full suite of traits that make something evil, while actually being *good* yourself-- it's impossible to be oriented genetically and phenomenologically towards domination, callousness, sadomasochism, deception, manipulation, charm, egocentrism, all of the psychopathic traits are a perfectly designed system(by evolution) for \"winning\" domination games, and be \"good\" at the same time, in some meaningful way. Reality is not a fantasy where the good guys rise up and defeat the bad guys with moxy and a can-do attitude or the power of friendship, it's always just different versions of evil running on egocentric narratives where they convince themselves *they're* the good guy, and the \"other\" is the bad guy.

The problem with meditation is it's a long term exercise. I would say the scenario is analogous to having a kind of physical condition where the muscles are severely atrophied, and long term therapy is needed(this is what the default mindless state is like). What often happens with meditation, is there's an attempt akin to \"doing a few sit-ups a few times a day or every other day\" for a week, or a few weeks, or a month. And then the report is \"It doesn't seem to be working\". Unlike situps, where there's more of an immediate feedback that things are either working or not:\n\n* You will feel a very clear burn in your abdomen\n* You *could* eventually feel an unhealthy type of pain like a strained neck if you're doing things wrong\n\nWith meditation, the exercise is a *remedy* for a failure to notice. When our evaluations of it, involve noticing. So it's really tricky. For me, the most useful idea was more of a philosophical approach:\n\nI recognized that when I was angry or sad; whether legitimately, illegitimately, usefully, or pointlessly(the latter being the most common), I was stuck in a state of mind where I wasn't even aware I was thinking. That's the nature of thought, it slips it, it sinks its teeth into you, and it ragdolls you around for a bit like a dog thrashing a chew toy, and then suddenly and without warning, it hurls you to another dog(another thought) to repeat this process. This is what a day in the human mind is like.\n\nThis is *bad* for just about any endeavor one is undertaking in life. Whether they're studying, working, being social, doing something important, doing something unimportant, relaxing, watching a sunset, watching a movie, or even experiencing the worst day of their life.\n\nIf we recognize that more lucidity in a way that is not just crystal *clear*, but **crystal**, in it's non-reactiveness, is purely advantageous to both stopping suffering and stopping the causing of suffering to others, then from here it becomes clear that we should take the project of improving this kind of attention very seriously. And the best known method we have for this is simply sitting down with eyes closed and carefully observing something like the process of breathing.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1623613843,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h1nl2y1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nmtnhb","locked":false,"name":"t1_h1nl2y1","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h1ndduu","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/nmtnhb\/where_do_i_start_with_my_mental_problem\/h1nl2y1\/","retrieved_utc":1627709733,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

But that's also why the philosophical part is pretty important I think. One ultimately can't engage in meditation with a desire for suffering to *go away* and \"succeed\" in that goal, it's unfortunately paradoxical that way. Recognizing aversion and valuing equanimity are slow, gradual paths to make suffering go away, but it's not doable if making suffering go away is a goal. It happens when you stop wanting it to happen, in other words, but this state only happens after very long term commitments to both training and philosophy.\n\nIf you ever decide to return to it, perhaps you could try slightly changing that response you noticed in consciousness(which was a huge step forward to notice-- almost no one gets to that step, sometimes even after giving the training a really solid effort like you did), to something like this:\n\n&gt; \"I'm having negative thoughts because I suffer from anxiety.\"\n\nAnd that's it. Skip the prescription or the solution. Don't react or judge or try to squirm away or fight or run. Just *notice* for as long as it persists. If the negative thought captivates you in a way where paying close attention is too hard, simply notice *this* once it occurs, and return to some simpler object of attention like the breath, or the sensation\/pressure related to being seated.\n\nBut yes, you're right, there's a far clearer feedback with physical exercise because there's not a ton of philosophy that goes into lifting something heavy and putting it back down. *Generally* working out regularly will have far clearer results, where as it's possible to attempt meditation for surprisingly long periods of time and get nowhere.

It can mean something, of course. It's useful to say a billionaire \"has\", and someone living in the slums \"has not\".

In other words, if money and beauty and status and close relationships(which, when one honestly examines the world, we *know* are almost always, at minimum, superficial manipulation games), and other such scenarios, are what cause genetic thriving, and then the conscious things that carry that molecular structure base value on things like a bank account or number of social media followers, this does not mean that these things **are** what value **is**.

Any time I see someone talking about a paradigm, I imagine what this would sound like in the context of Ancient Egypt, or some other civilization thousands of years ago: \"The year is 4,000 B.C. as of writing, and a paradigm shift is occurring\". Then I recognize that there's no special difference between 4,000 BC and 2021 AD. We shouldn't be concerned with paradigms, and only consider what is true or not true, and why. \n\nThe term \"objective values\" is just another way of saying \"Things that matter, as a matter of fact\" or \"There exist *some facts* about what matters\". Even though different things matter to different people, and people can fail to recognize something that matters, it still seems patently true without any kind of confusion around a tension between facts\/values(Hume did immense damage, likely through good intentions, to ethics with the invention of this meme, and if you buy Hume's reasoning, it would benefit you to re-evaluate). More on this [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Bo6OaOzuyLM).\n\nFirst, virtue:\n\nVirtue, if it means anything, is just another word that is synonymous with good. There's no good reason to think virtue is meaningless that couldn't also be used to also say the number \"2\" is meaningless. In other words, it's possible to deconstruct reality to such a degree that one is stuck in a kind of solipsistic bubble, but this does not mean that one should navigate reality with such a degree of skepticism towards what has meaning and what matters. \n\nSo to ask \"is virtue good?\" is like asking \"is two, 2?\"\n\nThen, suffering:\n\nSuffering is more complicated than the above writing, because there are many kinds of suffering. There is pointless suffering, there is meaningful suffering, there is superficial suffering, there is morally repugnant suffering, and all suffering is contextualized by ego. Notice that if there is notion of self, and there is no boundary between harm and thing harmed, then suffering is impossible, perspectivally. We know that the brain is one way to generate this feeling of ego. So Stoicism is technically right that it's a matter of perspective, but that doesn't justify the kind of Stoicism you encounter these days, where psychopaths adopt Stoicism to essentially blame the victim and tell them to suck it up. Stoicism, in general, is an expression of monkeys who are terrified of intense pain, so they convince themselves of something which is true by accident, which wise or unwise monkeys invented, as an attempt to deal with a hellish reality. So it's important to notice how farcical a misuse of Stoicism can seem if it's applied to something like the torture of [Sylvia Likens](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo).\n\nBut just contrast this with a very wealthy child in one of the largest toy stores on Earth. Under this fortunate(but also, unfortunate) child's care, they've been given **everything** they desire. In this instance however, the caretaker of this child, whoever that may be, decides to say: \"No. Not this time. You may not have this last toy.\"\n\nAnd this child proceeds to act like a generic child would in this position: By throwing a tantrum and signalling a combination of violence, and lamentations of despair. Is this child's suffering *real*? Clearly, the negative feeling is negative. If there was a drug that produced this exact sensation in us, we would not make the mistake of taking it a second time, if we were unlucky enough to try it for the first time. But it's still true that there really is something this child is missing about what matters. What matters is not likely what this child is superficially oriented towards by arbitrary monkey desires. Now, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe that toy, somehow, mysteriously, is the most important thing in the universe. That's *possible*, but probably wrong. But let's just say we're all crazy here, and this child is the only sane being in the universe. *Even* here, the child is confused, because the pathway to accessing this most important thing is not expertly navigated by the arbitrary emotional signals of monkeys who almost certainly desire stupid or superficial things. What's more unlikely than this toy being the most important thing in the universe is that this child is some de facto cosmic genius. No, of course not, they're just right by accident. But when you're right by accident, the blanks get filled in very quickly, and objective reality coalesces before you(When you're psychotic, this is also the same sensation, of course, but when you're right it's distinguishable at least objectively).\n\nHuman beings are basically like this child. We're either confused about what really matters, because we're egomaniacs, due to that being what won evolutionary games, or we're right by accident to some degree. It really is true to say that when the child grows up, and no longer throws a tantrum about the toy, they are wiser for it. Such a thing is a coherent idea. It's not arbitrary that the child version wants the toy, and is *really* right in throwing the tantrum, while the wise adult doesn't want the toy, and doesn't drop to the floor kicking and screaming, in the same way that it's arbitrary that one person prefers cake for dessert and another person prefers pie. The child is **wrong** here. This is what I mean when I distinguish superficial suffering from meaningful suffering, and to do this, you have to constantly evaluate reality from multiple vantage points:\n\n* Subjectivity\n* Objectivity\n* In practice\n* In principle\n\nThe more egocentric we are, the more we fail to do this, and the more narrow(and therefore, more wrong) our representation of reality is.

When people say \"I've become stronger because of it\" or \"If this didn't happen I wouldn't be the person I am today.\" I do believe these are forms of coping\n\nYes, it's simultaneously coping while also occasionally being a kind of wisdom-access. Suppose you have a person who *really* enjoys the suffering of others, so, a sadist. You have a conversation with this person, and attempt to convince them that sadism is not a disposition they should feel good about, using appeals to logic, ethics, etc. They are unphased, and turn the conversation into an opportunity to cause *you* suffering.\n\nNow, suppose we could ethically( we can't , but suppose we can) simulate a torture scenario for this person. All you would need to do, is torture this person sufficiently, and in a way that did not cause them death(and therefore, relief), they *would* potentially learn, the hardest way possible, and gain access to a kind of wisdom about what *really* matters in this universe. They could *fail* to learn, of course, since some people are simply doomed by their traits. Perhaps they'd exit this scenario with an even greater hatred for everything in the world, driven to cause it as much harm as was caused to them. But I think even traits, are malleable, given enough torture. The torturer applies the torture, and then says to the sadist: \"Are the sensations you're feeling caused by ethical actions?\" And they'd either answer or not. \"Would you wish this on another being?\" And they'd either answer, or not. \n\nLet's be very clear here: This is **not** a kind of ultra-meaningful behavioral conditioning(I use the word ultra-meaningful to distinguish it from the fact that all stimulus-subject relationships are, ultimately, implicated in behavioral conditioning). The torturer is not *looking* for the right answer, and causing the sadist excruciating pain if they give the wrong answer or no answer. There's no manipulation or psychological tricking to \"Re-train\" the sadist intentionally. This is just an ethics simulation, and the sadist is as free as it is possible for a being in our world to come to whatever conclusions are true. The torture is repeated no matter what they answer.\n\nIf the torturer applies the extreme pain enough, I believe even the traits will be re-oriented. Of course, this will be in the context of a survival agent, in a universe like ours. But this doesn't mean there's no wisdom, or that it's brittle. The wisdom here is *really* real. It really *is* wrong to torture things this way, and if the sadist learned that, that *is* a good thing. It really is a silver lining behind this torture.\n\nThis entire analogy is an effort to explain my beliefs about suffering, coping, and ethics. People who suffer deeply tend to get right by accident about what *really* matters, even if this is just \"coping\". Coping, or its elements, are not incompatible with wisdom or truth.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1623734300,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h1tfxag","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o059kj","locked":false,"name":"t1_h1tfxag","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_o059kj","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/o059kj\/when_people_say_theyre_thankful_for_their\/h1tfxag\/","retrieved_utc":1627699374,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

If having pets is wrong in general, but someone who has committed their life to ethics in general, deeply benefits psychologically from having a dog around to such a degree that they would kill themselves in pessimistic despair otherwise, then having a dog is simply the ethical move there. In other words, if we have two scenarios: One where David Benatar kills himself at 18, or lives on to study philosophy and write his literature and influence people to not procreate, and the two scenarios are conditional around a relationship with a pet, then, assuming his life's work is a) ethically true in theory and b) ethically impactful in practice, it is a kind of ethical emergency for David Benatar to have a pet, regardless if \"having a pet is generally unethical\". It would be nice if he'd adopt, but suppose he can't, for some odd reason. I believe it would be ethical even to breed a pet, in such a scenario. If the world was a simulation containing real suffering, and someone stood over the laws of physics where David Benatar is deciding between getting a dog or not, at age 17, and they \"veto'd\" the breeding of the dog on ethical grounds while *knowing* they are preventing the proliferation of the most prominent antinatalist work and therefore preventing countless human and animal suffering, to the extent that the former tracks reality, such a simulation engineer would be a moral monster to *prevent* the birth of that specific dog.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1623740723,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h1tnw42","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_nz8nq7","locked":false,"name":"t1_h1tnw42","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_nz8nq7","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/nz8nq7\/thoughts_on_pet_ownership\/h1tnw42\/","retrieved_utc":1627698975,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Capitalism is just a tool. It's a tool that, when used by beings who are oriented towards evil(which is **every** being in our universe, given that this is an entropic gradient consisting of finite resources and replication beings with no \"referee\" to say something is right or wrong-- this is the recipe that reliably produces evil, and this is why humanity and every other species will infinitely spin its wheels trying to fix something which can **only** be versions of broken), produces more evil.\n\nYou can know this immediately if you just imagine two worlds that are simplified, sandbox representations similar to our world. One world is full of strict, practicing Buddhists. The other world, is full of clones of Ted Bundy and young attractive women. Both worlds, contain lots and lots of hammers.\n\nIn world A, hammers are used in a pro-social way. To build things, to alleviate the suffering of conscious beings, and so on.\n\nIn world B, hammers are used as a means of torture and to facilitate rape and brutal murder.\n\nIt would be rather insane to look at world B and say \"Look, these hammers are everywhere. Can't anyone see that hammers are the problem here?\" But this is exactly how people diagnose our current world. Who wields the hammer can create a representation of reality that obscures the true culprit of a world's problems or virtues. Tribalism and bad psychology causes us to fail to see that the Christians were right about one thing-- there's something evil *embedded* into the firmware-- it's not some spooky magical original sin because of something that happened in a garden, this is of course a fantasy. But what's actually going on is simple once you look very closely, carefully, and honestly at [nature](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=204). Think about *where* you and I are. We're in a universe, and in this universe, the physics moves from order, to disorder. This is the second law of thermodynamics at play. Again, look at *only* the facts of the matter. Resources are finite. Things replicate. To replicate, things need to compete for resources. They invent strategies to do this, the strategies get encoded into the DNA or the \"formula\", and the next generation gets thrown into the gladiator arena. It has been 1 billion years of a conscious-creature meat grinder as far as we know right now. Notice how unphased we all are by this. We're eager to \"keep playing\" because the DNA has oriented us to keep diving into the pool of razor blades, over, and over, and over. Not just dive in-- but throw our infants in, as well, because it \"toughens\" them. Because you can't let the \"baddies\" win. This is a **fantasy** that the DNA orients us towards. You don't get ethical strategies if there are no rules, and there **are** no rules in this universe. The most skilled **cheater** wins in this place, and we're all oriented to cheat. We're oriented to fail to see how we ourselves are cheaters. Yes, this is sad, but it's also true. And \"fighting the good fight\" is simply not possible for beings like ourselves. This isn't to say that *changes* aren't possible,  we can pick the pool of thumb tacks over the pool of razorblades. We can decide to stop throwing our kids into hazardous pools(by not making any, perhaps). But we can't stop the people who develop \"Mentally ill bloodbath pool world\". You **can't** beat those people without our very own mentally ill bloodbath amusement park. We're indoctrinated by adaptive stories of good and evil. Notice all stories in popular fiction follow the same general formula: Good underdogs, versus great big Evil, the battle is long and hard, but in the end, through friendship or magic or faith or moxy, good wins!

All genes eventually produce evil because genes produce \"The other\". As long as you have \"the other\", to compete with for resources, status, reproduction, domination-- you get evil, every single time. Not because beings *can't* genuinely cooperate, but simply because beings eventually evolve unethical, covert strategies, which win and gain a foothold due to riding on the wave of entropy-- the fact that you much more easily start fires than put them out. It's easy to work hard and ethically and build your own house, but it's so easy for your evil neighbor to just burn yours and laugh as they are now free to win the competition they had with you over mates and resources. **That** is why replicating unconscious things(DNA) reliably forms the substrate of evil.\n\nSo even the apparently \"least evil\" move in the short term, results in a maximization of evil in the long term. And this remains true even if you instantly disintegrate the entire planet, because the odds are quite bad for the universe not having more, either in current stock, or in progress.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1624247831,"distinguished":null,"edited":1624249070.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h2i3lrm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o3p8ra","locked":false,"name":"t1_h2i3lrm","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_o3p8ra","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/o3p8ra\/life_is_evil\/h2i3lrm\/","retrieved_utc":1627649638,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

A world where people think morality is whatever Allah commands, for example, and completely structured around this belief, is not a moral world. It's in fact an immoral world, because Abrahamic religions are patently obvious fantasies for which there is zero evidence and much psychosis and psychopathy throughout history and our present world.\n\nThinking that morality is a matter of math, is almost certainly confused, because it doesn't account for how easy it is to be wrong about ethics. So it's identical to the above example where the world believes that Allah has already mandated to us what ethics is, and how these moral truths are given to us in certain texts, and now all we have to do is systematize this text, do lots of math, really min-max our Abrahamic ethics and voila-- we get a better world. \n\n**That** world, is objectively more hellish than the world where people just practice these religions in their current \"lackadaisical\"(Boy, what a euphemism, since actual theocracies still exist in 2021) way. Why? Because of the math, really. Again the question is why is it objectively *more* hellish-- not why **is** it hellish. The math really is the salt that is rubbed into the wound here. Sure, the confusion is the ethics themselves(the books and myths are bullshit, and if you had the right ethics, the math would be fine), but you really shouldn't be doing moral math as stupid fucking monkeys with clothes on in the arbitrary year 2021-- you'll just cause more misery. Instead, work on making sense of ethics first. We've failed here horribly, given our \"post-enlightenment\" stage. When you do math with bad input, you get hellscapes. The worst part here is, the people who are *least* oriented towards ethics(autists, psychopaths\/pro-social psychopaths, OCD-types, high-systematizers\/low-creativiity due to rigidity), **love** doing moral math. It's like a fun little puzzle to them with feel-y things, and they can \"win\" if they solve the puzzle! :)\n\nNo, just stop. Christ. Please don't create the EthicsGo AGI, because it's going to be a fucking nightmare developed by some MIT kids with high psychopathy\/autism traits(I hear they love BDSM over at MIT-- these people seem to be just as good candidates for doing ethical math as say, [Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh) ) who think utilitarianism is peak ethics.\n\nHere's a final thought-- if psychopaths were to adopt an ethical system to their utterly empty outward facing persona(which masks their utterly callous, dominaneering, and sadomasochistic inner drive), which school of formal ethics would they adopt? Which school of formal ethics is best paired with high egocentrism(Worth asking the question the opposite way-- which is the **least** egoic formal ethics? Hint-- it's the one that's the *opposite* of the last one).\n\nSo, to summarize in two sentences:\n\n\"There's a reliably hellish element in simply *adding* calculus and min-maxing to ethical systems, because those ethical systems are almost certainly wrong(bad input tends to get bad output, and min-maxed, enthusiastic bad input, gets you hell). Therefore, do much less math, and quickly recognize this approach as flawed, if you care about ethics, and instead return to the drawing board ontologically\/epistemologically.\"","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1624306087,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h2kp82c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o4dadk","locked":false,"name":"t1_h2kp82c","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h2ijq3v","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/o4dadk\/how_many_elephants_would_you_kill_to_avoid\/h2kp82c\/","retrieved_utc":1627644776,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

That ego actually harms you and everyone around you. That's the ego that grabs all the cake for yourself while others around you starve in the post apocalypse. Bad ego!\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \n\n\"Couldn't you say that *your* ego simply hasn't met the sufficient threshold for immense joy and satisfaction and therefore doesn't appreciate what really matters in life?\"\n\nNo, you couldn't-- simply because they're asymmetrical. If we could run the experiment, extreme pleasure\/extreme torture, we could settle this once and for all. It's not a matter of preference. It's not that I like chocolate but you don't, and you in fact like vanilla. We'd *both* agree that chocolate is **objectively** better for all sentient beings, if we could just run the experiment by tasting both flavors side by side. We'd say something like \"Wow, Vanilla is *really* good, but you know what? Chocolate's just way better. Way way better. Not even *close*. You're actually **insane** to ever pick vanilla over chocolate.\" This is what the current scenario is when it comes to humans who take for granted that we should just continue on here on Earth, versus those who recognize what the stakes are here.\n\nBut we can't run it for several reasons. One, we literally can't run it. Two, we can't subject you to extreme torture to make you see just how huge of a risk creating more conscious beings is. If you say \"Nike: Just Do It\", you're putting your foot in the door towards the torture of a billion trillion sentient beings, and whatever your best case scenario is, it's never worth that worst case scenario.\n\n\nEradicate all consciousness in the universe painlessly and save the world. Pick chocolate, it's objectively the superior flavor.\n\nEdit:\n\n&gt; This is a consequence of the fact that the far future contains an astronomically large number of lives.\n\nSo ... ensure a future that does *not* contain such an astronomically large number of lives instead. It seems to be a huge mistake to promote such a future, because you open the door to a hellworld, no? Reminder: A hellworld where trillions upon trillions are tortured in agony is **impossible** if you simply do not take the current steps to create such a populated world. **Stop** making more. You've got time now to make sense of right and wrong, do that instead. Ask bigger questions. Are humans an ethical species, or are we a psychopathic species? Are we really good at getting things right, or probably sort of bad? What does right and wrong really mean? Is it *really* just a matter of utility? There's no asteroid coming, the weather's still fine, get to work here and stop the stupid monkey behavior. It's like chimps who think the problem is a banana shortage so they instead spend all of their energy on maximizing bananas in chimp world, when it turns out the chimps are just stupid fucking chimps who don't understand that banana util isn't the peak of sentient creature wellbeing so they instead bring about a fucking hellworld of a trillion banana farming chimps. That's the analogy for our current ethical intuitions and endeavors as humanity. That's how tragically lost we are right now, even our *smartest* minds.\n\nEdit2: An alternative to eradicating all life would be to simply turn off all ego in the universe.

We can discover this by just imagining a kind of sandbox sim in our heads where a shark is attacking a fisherman wielding a harpoon gun on a boat, and playing with the shark's IQ and sense of self\/egocentrism or perhaps language \"dials\". These variables may seem arbitrary, but IQ and Ego and so on are really some of the only meaningful variables that differentiate the shark from a psychopath. Make the shark feel that they're an \"I\", and give the shark high IQ and able to process complex concepts through language, and then they're still a shark, but they're now oriented to predate upon this fisherman and cause them suffering in a totally callous way that's difficult to distinguish from a human being who does this too. They deceptively sneak up on them, they're fearless, they're callous, they're domination machines-- predators are pretty much psychopaths. Whatever is lacking just isn't that important, and if it *is* lacking, we can feel free to add it to the shark in our sandbox sim.\n\nSo here we are, the shark is planning to attack the boat to get that sweet sweet fisherman sustenance(lets pretend sharks love the taste of human flesh), and the fisherman has a harpoon gun, and will simply harpoon this shark directly in the face if it senses a threat to their life.\n\nNotice how intelligence doesn't really solve the problem. A shark with low intelligence doesn't even understand the concept of \"harpoon gun\" or the consequence of \"If attack, then retaliation\" or simply \"Dangerous moment\". It's fearless, because that's an adaptive trait for predators(and psychopaths). It has low risk-aversion(like a psychopath). It's a sadomasochist, loosely speaking, because it's oriented to cause immense suffering for its own gain, and it doesn't care if it gets fucked up in the process(if it was overtly concerned with its own wellbeing, it wouldn't be a very good predator, again, like a psychopath). The relevant trait here *isn't* a matter of IQ, otherwise psychopaths, who are generally intelligent(contrasted by sociopaths, your generic anti-social thug who reliably ends up in prison), wouldn't have a mortality rate 33 times higher( this statistic is for psychopaths between 30-40 years of age) than non-psychopaths. It's really the fearlessness, the low risk-aversion, and the orientation to fuck things up and not care, that's doing the heavy lifting here.\n\nSo does the shark ever go: \"Oh no! A harpoon gun!\" ? Of course not. It's identical to how human psychopaths just aren't deterred by this sort of thing. They just don't *care*.

It's a pity that you won't test the brittleness of the semantics that you're proposing here and simply take a white-hot piece of metal and apply it to your face for a few seconds. This is when the reality of semantics would crystallize for you, and you'd understand for the first time in your life, what actually matters.\n\n&gt;  You can either choose to be happy in it, or choose to mope around sad in it. \n\nChrist. Yeah, you can choose anything, but you're not free to choose what you choose. So what is the point of even saying that? It's like saying a father can choose to take a rock and bash it over his beloved child's skull. It's always people like you who espouse this kind of victim blaming.

Face + Hot metal to test your \"you can choose\" theory, any time you desire, just a reminder.\n\n&gt; The people around you aren't deluding themselves; they are molding the very real world they experience, by choosing to be happy.\n\nThe argument I'm making here is that these people are not experiencing reality, they're experiencing their own narrow experience, and therefore oblivious to the real suffering going on all around them. This is *not* sanity, I'm afraid.\n\n&gt; You are smart, and you could do the same.\n\nWe're all probably above average here, but sometimes intelligence can be a burden rather than benefit-- the more intelligent one is, the more clever they can be in lying to themselves. Intelligence did not evolve for processing reality accurately, intelligence evolved to come up with more clever adaptations. Intelligence is more of a catalyst towards being delusional rather than an antidote to delusion.

This means that a good percentage of the world is delusional about the nature of reality.\n\n&gt; I don't know a scientific way to way happiness against suffering, but since most humans (even the minority attempting and being prevented from suicide), choose to live, instead of ending it, thus life must be worth living for most of them.\n\nWell no, that's absurd to conclude.

It's almost as if we could imagine Capitalism going away, that all the things on planet earth that motivate both [animals](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall), [humans to animals](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg) and [humans to humans](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/), to be absolutely vile monsters to one another, would vanish. Capitalism just happens to be a dogshit explanation for the phenomenon of evil(or \"economic suffering\", whatever tangent a critic of Capitalism wishes to set the goal posts at).

Which, in hindsight, if some brilliant aliens came down suddenly to inform you that this is in fact the nature of the reality you and I exist in, would seem completely obvious. How could we miss it? Evolution is a game of optimizing winning moves, and in this game, there's no referee. Again, **there is no referee**. Read that sentence a third time over-- It's *simply* a power hierarchy where the most powerful thing writes the rules until the next most powerful thing beats it.

Nor does \"utility\", right... so... this becomes completely intuitive when you just look at the absurd conclusions when you take an autistic, rigid, robotic approach to ethics under these values, like the repugnant conclusion, or the NU version, a world where we're so allergic to suffering due to some kind of scope insensitivity that we find physical exercise or running morally reprehensible because they cause suffering, and any suffering at all, is intolerable. Again, it's easy to see why Util is absurd, because can just invent a world with a trillion hellscapes of a trillion trillion beings being maximally tortured, which also contains a trillion trillion heavens containing a trillion trillion beings experiencing maximum bliss. Such a world would be absurd, and you'd be a monster to promote such a world-- but you'd also be a Utilitarian.\n\nThis is similar to your drug addict scenario in its absurdity. There are so many points to argue here, and we can just go down a semantic rabbit hole where I say \"Well drug addiction is actually not as idyllic as drug-naiive people tend to think-- heroin for instance isn't pure bliss all the way down, it comes with immense suffering in upkeep and consequences, or suffering in principle which has its own value that many people doing moral considerations often fail to take into account\".(To clarify that: People seem to think that **only** subjectivity matters with ethics, so they justify a Matrix where all of humanity is plugged into blissful experience machines, while malevolent entities farm their vital fluids-- this is a hellword, according to my ethics, but many people doing ethics are actually fine with such a world because there's *technically* no harm. To me , the objective nature of reality is morally important.)\n\nFrom here, you could just say \"Well let's the make the drugs perfect so there's no negative consequences\" and we really get to... nowhere of value, because this doesn't actually teach us anything about what is true in a clean way. You may as well say eradicate all life in the universe, and now we'll be getting somewhere. It's simply true that there's no more ethically perfect state of reality than a state where both a) no conscious beings exist and b) no conscious beings **can** exist. Such a state, means a probability of precisely **zero** chance of suffering. The ego panics when it considers this scenario, but that's because barely evolved monkeys with clothes on just don't grasp very well what really matters when it comes to ethics, they're instead oriented towards their next meal, their next source of entertainment, their next sexual encounter, and so on. But these things never matter more than a 0 probability of hell for all potential beings in reality. Such a state is an ethically perfect state, as far as I can see, and you'd be the greatest moral hero in existence if you could bring such a state about. Now comes an interesting scenario: \n\nWhat if you proposed that to bring such a state about, we had to torture *lots* of beings for a very long time. Well then, here, you'd actually opt *against* the path to the ethically perfect state because the *road* to the ethically perfect state matters more than the ethically perfect state in this specific case. This is the opportune time to notice, and again I'll be using the word \"autistic\" here in a totally non-pejorative sense, to describe to you the *exact* cognitive mechanics for **failing** when it comes to ethics:\n\nA robot, an autist, an AI, or a person with a phenomenology characterized by what I'd call a \"pathological systematization\", would think in the following algorithmic way: \"Well if non-existence is the perfect state, and nothing is better than perfection, then we should torture large numbers of beings for incomprehensible timescales if it means we guarantee perfection!\" (It'd be less emotive than this, but this is the informal logic that could occur).\n\nThe reason why this is wrong is, we value ethically perfect states *because* we're trying to avoid torture in the first place. This is why those who are on the spectrum, or AI's, or AI's programmed by people who think in this general way, have a high risk of resulting in ethical nightmares, because this sort of paradoxical thinking *tends* to be incompatible with rigid, mathematical, or robotic ways of approaching reality. This is *why* the famous paperclip maximizer is a meme we worry about, and why we should get to what *matters* in existence(what are *values*) before we force what we **think** matters onto existence(it's **not** paperclips, it's **not** util).

Being able to completely resolve any medical issue financially, again, night and day(most people on Earth simply lack this as a viable move). Now, this could mean that you're financially *crippled* after your medical expenses finish resolving, which occasionally plays out in a way that favors the wealthy person *worse* than the poor person(because the poor person simply **dies** and the rich person clings on to an absolutely awful life of hospitalized\/disabled hell, supported by their financial ability), that's totally possible too. So there's no \"grass is greener\" fantasy illusion on my end where I believe rich people *simply* live better lives than poor people are a matter of **fact**, \" no if's ands or buts \", that in particular is a harmful and common fantasy that we really should unlearn quickly.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1624503123,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h2uduj3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o6comp","locked":false,"name":"t1_h2uduj3","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_o6comp","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/o6comp\/people_who_say_money_cant_buy_happiness_have\/h2uduj3\/","retrieved_utc":1627627737,"score":-1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

You can hear them think:\n\n\"Well if *everyone's* mentally ill, then *no one* is mentally ill!\"\n\nBut that's only how reality works from the narrow, pragmatic perspective of a species trying to make sense of what \"mental illness\" *really* means. Look at how this works with intelligence. Rocks are *objectively* unintelligent, as far as we know. Rats are much more intelligent than rocks. And humans are *much*, *much* more intelligent than rats. But it's so easy to imagine something much, much, much, *much*, **much** more intelligent than humans. What does this say about reality? Or about the phrase \"humans are an intelligent species\". Is everything *simply* relative? And brittle? And a perspectival illusion? No, not exclusively. It's true that humans are a species that possesses intelligence, but it's **objectively true** that humans are stupid, if we account for scope and scale in principle. The last few words aren't weaseled in here, they aren't some fine print-- this is what actually matters when it comes to reality, and a pragmatist will have a tendency to fail to see that. It's not only \"what works\" that matters, or what is, but what is\/what works **in light of** what *could* be(idealism), not in the purely hypothetical sense, but in the potential sense in practice. To distinguish those two things, it's like the difference between saying \"Tibetans could be Martians\" and \"humanity *would* be better oriented to solve its problems if it just stopped giving a shit about much of its tribal orientation\". The former is not the same as the latter in the way in which they're both \"true in principle\". The latter really is **true** in principle to the degree that you may as well say it *is* true. The former *could* be true in principle, but it's totally uninteresting otherwise.\n\nWhen we speak about reality, we're really hard signalling two sets of values to some degree: Pragmatism , and Idealism. We often lean in one direction or another, and sometimes *pathologically* so, that we miss the forest for the trees, or vice versa. Much of our failure to converge on reality is a failure to hash out this value dichotomy.\n\nWe can still produce an explanation of the human species that places us firmly into the \"mental illness\" gradient, and say \"Yes, the *species* as a whole is pathological.\" without sacrificing the meaning of words in the same way we can produce an explanation like \"humanity is *objectively* stupid\" while being able to say \"That's a very smart person\".","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1624546445,"distinguished":null,"edited":1624550586.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h2w34m9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o6zeaa","locked":false,"name":"t1_h2w34m9","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_o6zeaa","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/o6zeaa\/tom_chivers_are_twitter_trolls_mentally_ill\/h2w34m9\/","retrieved_utc":1627624695,"score":15,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

When we say \"*chosen*\", what do we mean? We often mean that they're *freely* chosen. Not freely as in \"No one is going to crack their whip at you if you make the wrong choice\" \"freely\", we mean \"freely\" as in, **really** freely-- a product of you and nothing but you, something which makes you **ultimately** responsible for the product of whatever emerges from the thing you're calling \"you\" \". \n\nThat specific idea, that last one, if you carefully think about it, simply makes absolutely zero sense. And this is why it's an unfortunate confusion to feel worthless about something like this, because it's simply not true that you're worthless due to some arbitrary thought or behavior that either occurs or doesn't, for reasons which, ultimately, you cannot account for.\n\nNow, what does this say about.... guilt? Or shame? Does it make no sense to feel these? Well, these are *important* emotions, and they serve a purpose socially, because if we genuinely do something wrong, it's good to be reminded internally. And if we're genuinely bad people in any given instance, or collection of instances, then this is important too, because no one actually wants to be a bad person in principle.\n\nYes, there are bad people who will tell you something like: \"But I *love* being a bad person!\", so it's possible to be ignorant of the insight that no one wants to be a bad person, but such a person, if they could simply see themselves clearly, would be mortified by who they are, if they **could** be mortified-- this is what it means to say \"no one wants to be a bad person in *principle*\".\n\nSo whether or not we can freely choose anything, or if we simply choose it as a product of who we are, emotions like shame and guilt are still useful, it's just that they can lead us astray like any other emotion.\n\nIf you still feel worthless, just remember only the facts of the situation: You didn't make yourself. You didn't pick all the variables that made you, you(genes, parents, environment, upbringing, day to day experience, which neurons fired and which didn't, luck, and so on). This doesn't mean that your actions or behaviors matter any less, it just means that no one can point to a dog and say \"How *dare* you not go \"MOOOO!\" \" and understand how reality works. If dogs going \"moo\" is good, well then we should say \"Could you consider going moo?\" or \"Wouldn't it be best if dogs went moo?\" But *hating* a dog who doesn't go \"moo\", makes zero sense. If a dog couldn't go \"moo\", then only an insane person would say that is the dog's fault, and if this dog was suffering from feelings of worthlessness because they couldn't go \"moo\", well then, it's just a tragedy because there's no *good* reason for this.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1624548823,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h2w8fp3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o6yvqd","locked":false,"name":"t1_h2w8fp3","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h2w5mo9","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/o6yvqd\/why_is_treatment_always_so_focused_on_behavior\/h2w8fp3\/","retrieved_utc":1627624435,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

It's really hard to subscribe to something like promortalism over a more generic ethical value like negative-utilitarianism(even here, there's lots of nuance and areas for confusion, and all this idea is trying to say is the very generic \"Suffering is very\/the most morally salient, therefore less suffering is good\")\n\nBut the conditions for promortalism being true are clear to me: You'd need a worst case scenario world where **every moment** spent alive, whether one is doing good, or doing nothing, or doing evil(in some paradoxical world where doing evil resulted in the most good, it's hard to not call this one too a \"worst case scenario\"), resulted in far worse conditions for the totality of conscious experience than **immediately** ending one's life.\n\nNow, it should be noted that the most extreme version above, does not make sense, because even in such a scenario, it would seem that dedicating one's life to promortalism could be much more beneficial than immediately ending one's life. From here, it would simply be a game of \"Okay, well how do we stay alive long enough so we can maximize how many people voluntarily commit suicide?\" Clearly, if suicide is the best move, then we should all *not* commit it, to paradoxically encourage more people to commit it. So we know that \"hard promortalism\" almost certainly makes no sense. In a similar way, I think we can also intuit that some kind of \"fascistic promortalism\" doesn't make much better sense than \"torturing all of humanity to make them appreciate that suffering *really* matters\" makes sense. These are both bad solutions that have missed the point of ethics to begin with. So in summary, promortalism should be entertained and taken seriously, while we continue to slowly make better sense of reality, because you're never going to successfully enforce your policy anyway even if it is true(you produce a bigger hellworld), and if it just so happens that your understanding of reality was wrong somewhere, then you produce a bigger hellworld.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1624552385,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h2wgim3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o73zdj","locked":false,"name":"t1_h2wgim3","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_o73zdj","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/o73zdj\/do_you_supportbelieve_in_promortalism\/h2wgim3\/","retrieved_utc":1627624030,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

A fuller answer is \"Trolls are psychopaths which is technically categorical but also appears on the dimension of psychopathy that the entire human species appears on, therefore it's meaningful to say that humanity is a psychopathic species\"\n\nI've already suggested that my personal bias here is idealism, so I prefer to describe humanity as a psychopathic species. I think truly benevolent, intelligent aliens, who had a sophisticated understanding of psychology(in terms of sentient beings, in terms of the ideal, I'm not speaking about the narrow body of science we call \"Psychology\" today), would label our species with the **category**: \"Psychopathic\"(and they'd be right in the same way that we're right when we categorize rabbits into \"mammal\"), but within this category we could of course split hairs and zoom in with our magnifying glasses and go\n\n \"Oohh this one called Ted Bundy is a *real* nasty one, but this one here who's just generically selfish, an absolute egomaniac, domineering, calculating, callous, lacking in empathy, manipulative, deceptive, superficially charming(traits which the average person alive today possesses as a result of being the product of millions of years of rape and murder and manipulation selection games), seems like a very plain specimen by comparison.\" To be clear, this doesn't mean a phrase like \"That person isn't a psychopath\" loses meaning. It's technically true that as a human, they're optimized for psychopathic behavior to some degree *simply* due to having DNA-- in fact my brush here is so wide, my semantics are so oiled, that I'm tempted to place really *anything* that contains DNA on Earth onto some broader psychopathic gradient(it's really not one gradient, but many overlapping gradients)-- potentially eye-roll inducing stuff, for a pragmatist.\n\nWhat will cause this idea to really lose entertainees, though, is that it's not falsifiable in **practice**(only). So it's theoretical, it's scientific(technically, like certain metrics we're currently unable to measure are technically measurable), but it can *probably* never be proven from within humanity because psychopaths dominate all of our relevant hierarchies, and such a self-destructive fact is unlikely to emerge from within human institutions.

If we had empathy all the time, then paramedics couldn't do their job for instance, because the person bleeding out in front of them and in pain would sit there... simply bleeding out infront of them... in pain, rather than get the morphine and\/or the treatment, because the paramedic would literally be feeling what they feel-- and they wouldn't be able to function.\n\nAlso it's possible to empathize with bad people(who really are just unlucky people). We don't want to *perfectly* empathize with a sexual predator of children for instance, not only because it would gross us out, but because we want the empathy to actually get us somewhere important ethically. Empathy isn't just some \"for fun\" emotion that's just \"plain good\" to have, nor is it that we don't want empathy for these predators because we *want* to hate them(I don't think hatred of these people gets us very far, ethically). It's like any other human behavior, like an emotional state-- it can be useful socially, but it sure as hell can misfire and get us to the wrong outcome.\n\nSo if you're around abusive people, maybe empathy is just one of the worst possible dispositions to think straight under. People with BPD are often accused of having no empathy and appearing like monsters, but there's another theory I read where they're just people who in fact tend to have pathologically *high* empathy and have developed a kind of empathy fatigue\/empathy disorder because their empathy can extend to deeply unhealthy variants too(remember the paramedic example?).\n\nIt's worth just carefully examining the people around you and asking if these people you've maybe attracted are abusive people who really don't have your interests in mind at all. It's easy to be wrong here, which is why people with BPD famously have a habit of sabotaging their relationships, so it's also very important to see this in reverse, too. It could very well be the case that we as *subjects* are the abusers, so you certainly don't want to harm others if that's what you're doing too. This is what would distinguish someone with BPD with a psychopath for instance, who simply genuinely doesn't and can't care. BPD's tend to be produced by abuse, and have a tendency to attract abusers and\/or find themselves in strange abuser+codependent vs. abuser+codependent dynamics, so priority number one is really just emotional security for the sake of healing because like the quote by the Robin Williams character in \"Worlds Greatest Dad\" says: \n\n&gt; I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone. It's not. The worst thing in life is ending up with people who make you feel all alone.\n\nIf marijuana helps you to recognize that better(your post here at minimum seems self-aware and considerate towards those around you, notice how good that is, and ask yourself if that has been in you all along or if that's really *just* the weed talking. I think it's more likely to be the former), then good. I can speak from experience that there's some therapeutic benefit to this drug because it, first of all, induces memory loss, both short term and long term, and not everyone necessarily *wants* to remember everything all of the time, like people with BPD who suffer the lasting effects of trauma. But hopefully you can treat this as a therapy and not some kind of long term substance abuse, because that road is rarely the best case scenario I think. Of course it's up to you ultimately, I just wanted to clarify what I think is worth considering in this situation.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1624574498,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h2xkja3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o6oxoz","locked":false,"name":"t1_h2xkja3","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_o6oxoz","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/o6oxoz\/weed_is_the_only_thing_that_makes_life_livable\/h2xkja3\/","retrieved_utc":1627622048,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

All moral claims are false is semantically harmonious with \"morals don't exist\", if you can properly detect the specific semantics there.\n\nI think it's clearly not true. I'm unaware of the specific claims Mackie makes in his book for why there are good reasons to believe moral claims are false, but the reason why I'm pretty convinced morality does exist, is the same as the reason I'm convinced mathematical claims are not universally false, and are either objectively true or not(given enough space for nuance for the totality of logic to describe it).\n\nMorality and its adjacent terms have a meaning regardless of our subjectivity. So morally salient notions like \"suffering\", \"injustice\", \"cruelty\", \"kindness\", \"honesty\", and so on, actually mean something, in the same way that \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", \"+\", \"=\", mean something. All mathematics is, is a description of the way these variables, integers, or numbers, behave. So a phrase like \"2+2=4\" is objectively true, and it's true regardless of the fact that we're subjective agents doing math, or the fact that mere humans invented math, or the fact that some predicament of subjectivity burdens us, or the fact that two people can disagree about facts of the matter when it comes to math, and so on.\n\nMorality is identical here. Morality doesn't have to do with rocks. As far as we know, rocks aren't conscious. If taking a pickaxe to a boulder produced the same kind of trauma that taking a pickaxe to a person's knee produced, then we'd be wrong about the relationship rocks have to ethics. But as far as we know right now, there's no moral appreciation that rocks have, as a matter of **fact**. Not opinion. This is true in the same way \"2+2=4\" is true. And if it turns out that we've done the math wrong there, and 2+2 , somehow, through some sheer stupidity of ours, is actually 5, or both 4 and 5, then we'd need our representations of reality to reflect this new information. But as of right now, it's true that 2+2=4, and it's true that rocks have no moral worth. Now there are semantic tricks you can play here, if you're dishonest, and it's a lot easier to do with the rocks-end of the analogy but it's still possible with math too. You could say \"Well that's not true because you can bash someone over the hand with a rock!\" So yeah, here a rock would have a relationship to ethics, but this is only true because of a further relationship to a morally salient being-- a person, or animal, or other conscious being.\n\nIf you grant that consciousness\/sentience is really meaningfully morally salient, and rocks aren't(again, *meaningfully*, not through semantic tricks), then you can move from here. You can ask, well what is it about these conscious\/sentient things that's morally important? Is everything really just about pie versus cake? Is that the bullseye of ethics? No, that's *objectively* not true. You can narrowly, like with rocks, find some instance, in practice or in principle, where cakes vs. pies impinge on conscious beings and cause them suffering or wellbeing, but it's **objectively true** to say \"Cake vs. Pie\" is not the absolute bullseye of moral value, in the same way it's objectively true to say that \"3\" is **objectively** not the largest number.\n\nFrom here, you get to questions of actual moral worth, suffering, thriving, etc, and the entire way it's just purely matters of fact, right and wrong, only \"is\" statements, identical to math. Notice there's no \"we ought to do math\" or \"we ought to get 4 when we add two and two\", it's simply done, and ethics functions the exact same way, which is the short explanation for how Hume was wrong about ethics and why everyone who buys Hume's famous phrase is confused.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1624580150,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h2xun1m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o5wfsw","locked":false,"name":"t1_h2xun1m","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_o5wfsw","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/o5wfsw\/what_do_you_think_about_moral_error_theory\/h2xun1m\/","retrieved_utc":1627621549,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Subjectivity and objectivity are in superposition on some level. There's nuance here, of course. It's possible to be subjectively depressed, but objectively, suffering from a psychosis where one is simply *lying* to oneself and reaping the consequences of believing such a lie, emotionally. But all of this is accounted for in an objective description of the subject. No interpretation is *merely* subjective, because every element of subjectivity is also a description in objective space: \"That *subject* is having an interpretation, as a matter of **fact**\". \"Two and two make four, as a matter of **fact**, irrespective of subjects merely making mathematical interpretation.\"\n\n&gt; You could have the phrase \u201cpointless euphoria\u201d too.\n\nYes you could.

You just can't **know**!!\"\n\nYou'd be technically right if you pointed this out, you *can't* know. But that... doesn't matter, do you see? Not knowing this, doesn't tell us **anything** terribly meaningful about the *fact* of mathematical truths. Just because someone could say \"I prefer 2+2 to equal 5\" does not mean math is a matter of preference, because numbers have meaning. Just because someone could say \"I prefer to torture children\" does not mean ethics is a matter of preference, because the words that characterize meaningful representations of what ethics is(just like numbers characterize meaningful representations of what math is), have a meaning, and they map subjectivity onto objectivity, in their meaning.\n\nRepeating myself here from the last post.

We know enough about the brain and behavior to know a few things:\n\n\n* Regions of the brain are linked to specific behavior. If you harm one area that processes, say, language, or impulse control, or emotional regulation, the regulation of that thing will evidently be missing to some degree from a person, but everything else generally works fine within that *context*. They may suffer in other areas but it's really only insofar as a failure of whatever region you damanged impinges on their lives. There's an ecosystem in the brain.\n\n* The brain is plastic(the ecosystem can change), and people can change dramatically, for better **and** for worse, given the right(or wrong) circumstances. This can range from years of abuse, a single traumatic event, a drug experience, training, a brain tumor, some other malady(or the sudden clarification of a former malady through things like the aforementioned happenstances)\n\n* **Some** set of people, psychopaths, narcissists, or even people who aren't what we'd call \"bad people\", but are simply suffering severe depression, are seemingly resistant to really everything we throw at them.

Both of those would be too hasty for us to say.\n\nNow, whether or not you should **try** to \"fix\" a narcissist, or psychopath, etc-- the answer is easier: Almost always at this stage of our humanity, the answer is 'no'. These people are harmful to others, and you really should take that danger seriously. I wouldn't say the answer here is \"never\", because I'd like to keep the door open to everyone, I think narcissists and psychopaths really are unfortunate victims of unfortunate lives, and they suffered\/suffer deeply by being people who are oriented to cause others harm, but you have to protect people who are their victims first and foremost, and steer them in the right direction: Away from the narcissist\/psychopath, as quickly and painlessly as possible.

But no one is saying \"Animal agriculture is unethical only because some animals get treated much worse, while other animals get treated much better.\" The enterprise of exploiting the animal for our preferences is unethical. It can be helpful to understand this by performing the following experiment on yourself:\n\nNo matter what you believe or don't about what happens after death, it's true that you simply can't know for sure. Let's be highly conservative and for the sake of argument assume that nothing, phenomenologically, happens after the brain dies. Now suppose a sophisticated alien told you that you had two choices-- you could be reborn at random as a cow on planet Earth(Russian roulette, because you could be born as the very rare cow that gets lots of affection on a benevolent farm and painlessly killed, or you could be reborn [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg). Alternatively, the alien says, you could just return to the same state you were in as before your birth. If a person is sane(like a person who wouldn't play Russian roulette in literal terms), they'd pick the latter option, right? It's just not rational to gamble, we'd say. But now what if the alien says they're going to, in their own words, \"Sweeten the deal\". They introduce a third option which *guarantees* you to be spared from a place like Fairlife or similar, and instead tell you you'll go somewhere like [Hart Dairy](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5O5WOUzFlRQ). So we have the gamble which includes cow hell, we have the generic \"Humane\"(by the standards of humanity in arbitrary year 2021) farm, or we have \"A return to before u\/ulyssessword was born, which is a state containing exactly zero suffering. Does the introduction of this third option really change anything? \n\nConsider what'll happen: You're still a cow. You're still born, confused, likely in some pain and discomfort because you're in this strange place containing people who aren't exactly **perfectly** oriented to have your best interests in mind(not even parents of human children are, most of the time, notice). So you're fed whatever they decide to feed you. You can't really protest if something goes wrong because, again, this isn't about you. The purpose of your life **is**, ultimately, as a source of a profit for a human being. If you're ever inconvenient somehow to this goal, there's no negotiation, even if you *could* speak English. You are, for all intents and purposes, a slave who isn't beaten. You're still forcefully impregnated. You experience birth, which is intensely painful, over and over again, and you're likely not perfectly optimized to your instincts to care for your young, likely far from it. You're still manipulated around, from pens, to fields, and whether or not you're actually interested at any given time, is not up for your debate. You are not free, but you are tossed around, for someone else's needs, as an expression of their domination over you. If you ever run long into your lifespan, and suffer the tolls of age, but still have value to those who dominate you, again, your desires will never take precedent. You **are** a slave.\n\nI don't think anyone other than someone who is already *at*, or *adjacent* to, the disposition of someone who could say \"You know what? I wouldn't mind playing Russian roulette in real life. It sounds like it could be a thrill!\" would ever pick this unnecessary second, \"better\" option. There's no question there'd be more toil and more misery than simply not existing. And this is why it's not ethical to do-- because you wouldn't want it done to you, and if you just truly and honestly implant yourself in the experience, and suffice that one is oriented towards ethics( Not a psychopath, not fearless as a result of this, not suffering from a pathology of low risk-aversion, not lacking self-awareness, not lacking empathy, not deceptive-- in the sense of *self* deception, where they'd lie to themselves about what they'd really do in a thought experiment in order to maintain some sense of logical consistency maintenance over updating their representations with new evidence, and so on), then one will never pick the \"Cow simulation\".","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":1,"created_utc":1624597068,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h2yofo3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o7ciru","locked":false,"name":"t1_h2yofo3","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h2yhww8","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/o7ciru\/where_to_find_representative_data_on_animal_farm\/h2yofo3\/","retrieved_utc":1627620085,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

I once thought that conservatives were the sadists, and the liberals were the masochists. That's probably some illusion I have due to false patterns around the political compass and psychological dispositions, gender, etc. I should re-think that. My personal Steelman towards CRT is, it could be an attempt to solve the problem of power by making a farce of power in demonstrating what a joke it is to just re-write language to produce ethical absurdity, but I don't think we need this lesson, because it's all around us with cases like Nazi Germany and North Korea, and in dystopian literature.\n\nAfter thinking for a bit, it seems like the political extremes *used* to be more clearly gendered, but it's as if the subversive gender within conservatism(femininity) and the subversive gender within liberalism(masculinity) has acted upon each political force in the most toxic way possible as a means of empowering it, which would help explain why the worst elements of modern liberalism are more sadistic and malicious than the worst elements of old conservatism. I think polar opposites in general start out a certain way, but then eventually the opposite of whatever that is erodes it and shapes it into a system that becomes a combination of both opposites. So if masculinity is sadistic rather than masochistic due to some evolutionary drive, and masculinity dominates conservative views, then eventually the opposite elements of that will bleed in, and you'll get the final form of the psychopathic trait \"sadomasochism\".

There'd be the school of math that thinks math is really about logic. Another school would say \"No no no, it's *symbols*, you get to mathematical truth through symbols.\" And another one would say \"Proofs\" are what make math, math. All of them would of course reject the idea that there's anything *really* true, about math. We merely subjectively hallucinate that 2+2=4. 2+2 doesn't *really* equal four. Some schools would show you how 2+2 equals 5, or that you can't ask the question because math isn't really about proofs.\n\n If this sounds insane to you, that's exactly where we are, academically, when it comes to ethics, in 2021. If we were too stupid to deal with math in a neat, bottom up way, we'd have pathologically compartmentalized it to the point of being fucking clueless too, but fortunately, this wasn't the case, so we're actually in touch with reality as far as we can tell when it comes to mathematical truths.\n\nWe'd be wise to not endeavor to start the \"meta-mathematics\" department, right now. Unfortunately we're already stuck in the quicksand of meta-ethics, so like any problem on an entropic gradient like ours, it's hard to solve simply due to the fact that dousing something( or someone, alas), in gasoline, striking a match and setting something(one) on fire is trivially easy(which is why bad intentioned people thrive and never really die out, only get stronger+better camouflage) but un-burning things or constructing new working things is either really hard or just impossible.\n\n&gt; I thought that the point of your analogy was that we shouldn't neglect reasonable opportunities to improve the world (such as preventing burglaries) just because they distract from a really great pie in the sky.\n\nIn light of what I wrote, the point was more like, we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that what really matters, matters in the trivial sense too, and it isn't just because we have a bandwidth problem. Because to ignore it means we end up doing something like torturing people to get ethical wisdom, which makes us lose the game(and win another game, a very unethical game, which again means losing in the most meaningful possible sense). It's about understanding a) what matters b) what is true\/how is it true c) the way causality works d) understanding how things reliably get bad and how to navigate away from that and how that impacts future navigation. Ethics is not even only about something as narrow as suffering(NU is the closest to what I think works, but it's not perfect), setting the right intention matters. Being flexible where it can lead us astray matters. These don't translate well into ethics as well as an axiom like \"integers, when added, should form the sum of each other\"(due to a lack of skill and wisdom on our part), but ethics functionally identically the same way, axiomatically, and is objectively true in the same way.\n\nIf someone thinks, and this is in the most semantically literal, precise sense, wrt the word \"better\", \"we just need to make things better\" means \"things get better\", then they're confused, because what's really only happening here is:\n\nThings get better for the [predators](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=13), but things get worse in the grandest ethical sense\n\nIf you're still unsure what I'm trying to say, forget everything I said for a second and consider that throughout our history of \"progres\", we've only ever \"made things better\", we've oriented the reality around us to maximize the peak positive experience, but never really strived to ensure things don't get worse. We've **made** things worse, in fact, by making them \"better\", both in practice and potentially. We've perfected torture. Sure, no one's getting brazen bull'd today, but people are getting [Sylvia Lykens'd](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo) today, and we've only multiplied the potential for misery because we're Lions, and we just don't care, insofar as we engineer the world to be one big \"Upper\". The solution is the opposite-- a tranquilizer dart, because people on cocaine are really obnoxious, and when the coke wears off, they're just animals, while H junkies can be really bad, they're objectively less bad. What do I mean by objectively? I mean objectively in the same sense I do where I mean you'd **objectively** live a better life if you were forced to room with someone who had an addiction to Diet Coke than if you were forced to room with someone who had an addiction to *actual* coke, and pretending that this is purely a subjective preference, causes harm(refer to the pathology of our academia re: \"meta-ethics\").

While very young, physical trauma. I had a bad burn on my left land, on the palm, that was second degree, at 1. About 15% of the palm and fingers, and they grafted skin from my thigh in surgery. I don't remember any of it, but there's no question the world showed how it can be to me early on, for better or worse. No real disability from it other than I really struggled to learn to play the guitar later because there was a bit of webbing from the scarring, and I couldn't stretch out my hand normally to cover the frets.\n\nMost of the conscious trauma here was to my mother, and then childhood\/adolescence was a bunch of abuse. No sexual assault though. I share this with you too:\n\n&gt; I kept thinking \"where did that child go? Where did that joy go, that innocence and love for the world and those around me?\"\n\nDespite the accident, I was super curious and open to everything as a kid, and with the help of probably being on the spectrum to some degree, I lacked the social skills to really notice that anyone around me may be bad, so I was often scolded for doing things like giving homeless people money, or once I remember a priest in Catholic sunday school took me out of the classroom to cruelly twist my ear and tell me to stop asking so many questions because I asked something like \"why there weren't any dinosaurs in the bible?\"( I really loved dinosaurs and legos early on). Other than that, lots of physical abuse, psychological abuse, bullying, and so on, which became a kind of cycle because if the kids gang up on you, you do poorly in school all of a sudden(I was a straight A student until 6th grade, I had the best grades in the entire school so they'd send me to represent the school when they had to pick a single person for things like city-wide spelling bees), but then no one can really function when the cycle of abuse begins, so that was the end of academic thriving for me.\n\n&gt; But I don't want to give up hope that I can find that part of myself again. \n\nDefinitely, silver linings exist, and there's plenty of things to be grateful for or discover. We don't need to lie to ourselves about things being better than they are to admit the genuine facts of the matter that are positive or worthy of recognition, or the potential to improve.

It's a perfectly valid question I think to ask:\n\n \"Does the free will debate case *harm* in some way?\" \n\nor\n\n\"Does teasing out what is true about free will, whether or not we have it, or arguing about the semantics of conditions like determinism, fatalism, causality, decision-making, poison us in some way that maybe we should just drop the subject, or lie?\"\n\nI think the answer is no, but re: harm, anyone can be harmed by just about anything. It's possible to be psychologically destabilized upon realizing that I have no choice to write what I'm writing(due to being convinced that there is no free will, due to being the sort of person that reads \/r\/negativeutilitarians, due to being the sort of person who is drawn to the subject, due to the happenstance of physics that joins what I call \"me\" and this thread, just like you have no choice to read what I've written up to this point. What does that mean? It means that there was no way for you to *not* have read what I just wrote. That's all people are saying, and it's possible to admit this and be traumatized. Sure, there's no question about that. It's also possible to discover Santa Claus is fictional, and be traumatized. But I think it's harmful to tell people they have free will. The harm caused by this idea, is really the most philosophically and ethically misunderstood harm in the last several thousand years. To fully hash out the implications of no free will, while also recognizing that moral realism is true, means that it is impossible to be unjust or cruel or malicious to another living thing, as long as one is fully aware of these realizations about free will\/morality. Even if you *just* accept the golden rule, and no free will, then being a hateful asshole is no longer logically coherent behavior. Causing others suffering as a result of \"punishment\", is not logically coherent behavior. The moral nightmare that we call \"Criminal \"justice\" \", vanishes, the moment you recognize free will is a harmful fantasy. The morally repugnant selfishness of billionaires who think a thought like \"I'm truly amazing, and self-made. But look at those lazy saps choosing to be poor-- Good for nothing.\", becomes utterly incoherent if you just remember that you don't have free will. Of course, it's really hard to be aware, for us monkeys. Humanity is full of buggy hardware and software, but we know progress is possible there.\n\nSo to conclude, yes, we absolutely talk past each other. We can utterly depress not just laypeople but even philosophically oriented people or career academics by beating the long dead corpse of the free will horse. People can be confused and think nihilism results from no free choices. People can even be so confused as to think there's no reason to choose, if nothing is chosen freely. There are lots, and lots of ways to get the truth about *anything* wrong, but the stakes in ethical terms with free will are so immense and underappreciated that I think we're unfortunately forced to at least continue risking depressing people because there's a mind-bending amount of pointless misery that comes from the idea that people can really be *worthy* of blame, hatred, contempt, retribution, spite, and so on, when such an idea is nonsense, simply due to the idea that no one is free to choose anything. This misery absolutely eclipses whatever neuroses we may have about not having some magical freedom to do anything other than where the physics and causality takes us. Despite this fact, we still have to choose things(things that are simultaneously, chosen for us, by causality-- there's no logical contradiction here as long as the word \"Free\" doesn't enter the picture).

Another such major trap is semantic, and it's one of the most tedious. The core semantic failure in the free will debate, is conflating action and free action. Choice with **free** choice. We use these terms **utterly** interchangeably, depending on which side we're on, and we *don't* use these terms, when being extra precise would harm our argument. So let's just be extra precise. It's utterly uncontroversial that that complex agents can act within a range of possibilities(in principle, right?), in a way that rocks cannot, and that such agents truly do weigh and choose and can deliberate for as long as they are conscious. The fact that we're not speaking clearly here may tell us what our real *worry* about losing free will is. We should be more interested in talking about *that* worry, not arguing if it's real or not or compatible.\n\nNo arguer against free will will ever say it's not the case that we can act, but it's true that one can't **freely** act, or decide. We're not free, we're swept in a riptide of causality. And that's okay. There's nothing wrong with that, nothing bad happens, and in fact there's a bonus here in that we become less awful to each other once we accept that we're all stuck in this riptide and not *really* authoring ourselves or our actions. It's simply the **fact** of the matter that we are, right? We clearly agree here-- compatibilists understand causality. So let's speak about something more interesting like whether or not this truth is harmful or not, or what we mean by other words, or what we're worried about.\n\n&gt; In essence, what I think the latter camp is emphasizing is the fact that we have ex-ante possibilities: a range of possibilities we can choose from in expectation. (For example, in a game of chess, your ex-ante possibilities are comprised by the set of moves allowed by the rules of the game.) **And since this latter camp defines free will roughly as the ability to make choices among such ex-ante possibilities, they conclude that we indeed do have free will.**\n\n(my emphasis)\n\nA more parsimonious word to describe \"The ability to make choices among ex-ante possibilities\" is *will*, not *free* will. You have a will here, a preference, a motive, a drive, a pushing, an impinging, that pushes you along a subjectivity of choices, and you feel as a subject that it is **you** who is making a choice. But there's no freedom anywhere to be found. If you asked me now, \"Do you feel free?\" My gut reaction would be \"yes\". But I know intellectually that everything about me is an algorithm being expressed, even though subjectively I'm deciding between two things. None of this means I need to think I'm \"freely deciding\" in the magical sense.\n\nOne of the roots of this debate is about how our semantics transfer over to our beliefs, and the feedback this creates. If someone believes they're extra free, they'll feel so free that they may say \"I have free will\". This is important. It's not a matter of intelligence, it's not a matter of sophistication. Understanding free will is a matter of paying attention-- it's a matter resolved by understanding phenomenology. We should be putting free will believers and disbelievers into fMRI's or creating a psychological analysis like Jon Haidt did with politics to expose how political dispositions correlate with personality traits. I believe belief in free will does too, and it would be more quickly resolved by psychology or brain imaging, rather than in philosophy departments. No amount of conversation will resolve free will if it hasn't already been resolved. We have more than enough facts, but the meme persists.\n\n&gt; The emphasis on prior causes is important for understanding the nature of our choices and actions. In particular, it helps us understand that our choices do not comprise a break with physical mechanism, but that they are indeed the product of complex such mechanisms (which include the mechanisms of our knowledge and intentions, as well as the mechanism of weighing various ex-ante possibilities).\n\nYep, no problems here.\n\n&gt; In turn, this emphasis may help free us from certain bad ideas about human choices, such as naive ideas about how anyone can always pull themselves up by their bootstraps. \n\nThe word 'always' isn't necessary here because any feeling at all of \"pulling oneself\" is a fantasy and harmful(From here, we're arguing for utility\/nu, depending on how you wish to see the glass filled). This includes feeling special, that we're some source of our own success, it's \"you\" or \"I\" who did it-- pride. Just notice what goes out the window here. Nationalism. Racism. Tribalism. Identity politics. Species-ism. Sexism. If there's nothing special about \"you\", there's nothing special about any given element you identify with-- it's all arbitrary causal soup. No one goes \"God **Bless** America, the **Greatest** country on the entire planet Earth... in this utterly arbitrary causal soup...!\" Notice how insane that sounds, and it sounds insane for a reason-- it's incoherent behavior. The moment we perfectly stop any notion of free will, and have its consequences crystallize in our brains, no more pointless violence or malice or negative social elements, and only furthering projects that matter rather our own narrow fictional and arbitrary identity markers. \n\nYou can still be \"born in Luxembourg\" of course, but there's never any feeling that Luxembourg is somehow special, you could have been born anywhere, or that your life went well\/you're wealthy because there's some special effort you freely did which you deserve a pat on the back for, and others who fail, deserve a slap for. As far as \"What is compatible?\", there's nothing about admitting this that takes any magic out of life. You can *still* understand all of this, and have a twinkle in your eye when you think of Luxembourg. You can still say \"I have a deep affinity for Luxembourg, it means a lot to me\". None of the good things in the world get harmed by admitting we're robots. \n\nTo be clear, it's not *specifically* free will that produces something like Nationalism, but it does a lot of heavy lifting to the point that such a position is hard to make sense of when one admits who we are and where we were born is utterly arbitrary. It's an appreciation and full \"firmware upgrade\" that you really didn't make yourself, and are not responsible in the \"worthy of blame\" sense(you're responsible in other senses-- legally, maybe as a guardian, maybe in another narrower ethical context, which means \"one ought to do the right thing, whatever that is, by definition\"). But we should stop rewarding and punishing people for what amount to arbitrary configurations of causal soup-- *that's* crazy and deeply unethical and produces insane amounts of misery.\n\nThere are compatibilists who either give me a sense that they understand the causal soup but they either seem to betray a belief that they never explicitly say, or rarely *explicitly* say, which is that they *believe* in belief in free will. They believe the meme of free will is beneficial. I think it's the opposite-- I think if we really had a kind of free will that made punishing robots and rewarding them for code they didn't create fine, then it may be one of the few things I can imagine worthy of strongly and very negatively stigmatizing the *mere mention* of, and never speaking of it, because of how much harm the idea(the true idea, in this case), causes. \n\nFortunately I think that's not our situation, because the idea of anything being *meaningfully* free and producing the kinds of consequences the meme of \"free will\" does(Prisons, judging people vs. actions, revenge, spite, etc) is so nonsensical that if you tried *right now* to make the world *less free*, like strapping every living thing into place, sedating them until utter immobility, and sustaining their vitals for the rest of their lives...\n\n(and here's the hopefully, potentially, mind-blowing sentence that really risks setting the light bulb off semantically\/conceptually, or hopefully, where I expose my ontological ignorance)\n\n...you would change **nothing** about the way the world works, fundamentally, in terms of free choices.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1624751935,"distinguished":null,"edited":1625225283.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h35re2d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o8fq4x","locked":false,"name":"t1_h35re2d","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_o8fq4x","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/o8fq4x\/free_will_emphasizing_possibilities_magnus_vinding\/h35re2d\/","retrieved_utc":1627604801,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

So for instance, if someone bumps into you very forcefully, **five times** per day, every day, with no other context at all, well then here we often *feel* it makes no difference what the intentions were. We can still add context here to make the case very, very different. Just look: Context 1) The person bumping into you, has downs syndrome. Well here, we're clearly suffering but it's just unfortunate for everyone involved. Now look what happens when we change it: Context 2) The person bumping into you smiles sadistically at you when you make eye contact and chuckles to himself. Now it's just fucking creepy because this person advertised exactly who they are. \n\nBut now let's go back to something less hypothetical: Someone bumps into you forcefully **once**. It's just an isolated case. Well, that's something we should let go, if there was no bad intention whatsoever to do so, and we'd want someone else to do the same, because we're in this crazy world where mistakes happen, unintended. We shouldn't say \"Hey! Watch where you're going dumbass!\" Because here, we're being short sighted and malicious ourselves. And if it's the malicious person like last time, again, notice how much the intention matters in the isolated case. To drive this home even more, return one last time to the extreme, repeat-bumping case:\n\nYou may have thought, \"Okay, well the person with Downs Syndrome doesn't seem very morally responsible to me.\" So let's make it a normal, average person. Not evil, but clearly a person you can have a conversation with. This person bumps into you forcefully, repeatedly. The first few times you simply excuse them, but eventually the intentions don't matter, you're getting assaulted. You've told them to stop, and there's something wrong. They even apologize every time, in an utterly genuine way. But subjectively it's not the same as the first \"oops\".\n\nSo the point here really is intentions *really* matter a ton, in the singular cases. But the more you get punched in the face \"by accident\", the less and less intentions matter. But even in the extreme, just plug in the truly evil person with the worst intentions doing the deed, and you'll see that even in the extremes, the intentions *still* change the character of the experience to be far more negative.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1624765164,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h36d8p2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o8n6bh","locked":false,"name":"t1_h36d8p2","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_o8n6bh","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/o8n6bh\/our_behaviors_can_be_abusive_it_doesnt_matter\/h36d8p2\/","retrieved_utc":1627603671,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

It comes along with our nature that intuition can never be other than sensible, i.e., that it contains only the way in which we are affected by objects. The faculty for thinking of objects of sensible intuition, on the contrary, is the understanding. Neither of these properties is to be preferred to the other. Without sen\u00adsibility no object would be given to us, and without understanding none would be thought.\"\n\n\u2015 Immanuel Kant, The Critique of Pure Reason, The Idea of a Transcendental Logic\n\nI worry that Kant simply didn't have access to post-Fruedian or Eastern concepts here surrounding \"The ego\" or \"The Self\", and specifically the brittleness\/superficiality\/error-proneness of these things. The intuition contains the way in which we are affected by objects *subjectively*, and the way we are actually affected by objects, may differ from the intuition. This is the sort of phrasing Kant would have made if he *fully* appreciated the ego or how easy it is for monkeys like ourselves to feel one way, have things seem one way, but this seeming and it's causes, ultimately, being fictional or confused or not truly meaningfully representative of objective reality. The core point:\n\nAll subjectivity is objective to at least some tiny degree in meaningful terms, but some subjectivity *truly* converges with objectivity(either by accident, for good reasons or bad reasons or as a result of something else, whatever that may be).\n\n&gt; \"Neither our knowledge nor our insight will ever be increased to any great extent by a comparison and discussion of what has been said by others; for this is always merely like pouring water from one vessel into another. Only through our own contemplation of things themselves can insight and knowledge be really enriched; for it alone is the living source that is always ready and at hand. It is, therefore, curious to see how would-be philosophers are always busy on the former path and do not appear to know the latter at all; how they are always concerned with what one man has said and what another may have meant. Thus they are, so to speak, always turning old vessels upside down to see whether some drop may have been left behind, whereas the living source flows neglected at their feet. Nothing so much as this betrays their incapacity and gives the lie to their assumed air of importance, profundity, and originality. \n\nThis is very interesting-- I've never thought about memetics this way, but I think the very act of pouring itself, due to entropy, due to the mechanics and rules of this game of \"telephone\" we're playing, changes **something** about the knowledge or insight, for better or worse, because no vessel is ever identical, and every vessel is impermanent. My merely telling you even something as unchanging as \"2+2=4\" , forever catapults this meme on a new trajectory, seen through fresh eyes and mind. The way this knowledge is embedded changes as well, because it's no longer in the unique vessel it came from, and the soup within that vessel-- it's now a part of a new pot of soup.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1624835844,"distinguished":null,"edited":1624836367.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h39h8bj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o5ww4f","locked":false,"name":"t1_h39h8bj","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_o5ww4f","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/o5ww4f\/on_knowledge_and_originality_of_thought\/h39h8bj\/","retrieved_utc":1627597472,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Coping is a kind of false acceptance or false problem-solving, to me. To cope is to not be in touch with reality.

Like they have a model of the world that\u2019s skewed, but they can\u2019t let themselves see it\u2019s skewed. \n\nYes, I granted this earlier. It's easiest to show you the mechanics with a psychopath, because they're pretty much a more extreme, more malicious version.\n\nThink about the purpose of self-awareness from the vantage point of psychopathy in evolutionary terms. Think about what the psychopath is trying to achieve. It's a domination phenotype, the goal is to win evolutionary games, and so on. So it's \"doing battle\", whether that means; for its life, or for resources, or for status, or because its a psychopath-- doesn't matter. So it has these traits that allow it to do battle, right? Fearlessness. If it had fear like a non-psychopath, if it felt it had skin in the game, then it couldn't do the sorts of things it does. One can't be an optimized psychopath if they're afraid. They feel no fear in situations that are high risk, because this lets them *be* psychopaths, because that's just what evolution churns out with enough selection pressure. Speaking of risk, risk-aversion functions the same way. Fearlessness means nothing if they're *able* to process risk or interested in risk at all-- so that gets the dial cranked down too. \n\nSelf-awareness, works the same way. For a psychopath to be self-aware, it doesn't mean they'd think what you wrote:\n\n&gt; \u201chey, why am I helping myself but not this other person who is just like me?\u201d\n\nFor this you need *other* traits. Psychopaths don't give a shit about the other person. They *can't* give a shit, because other people have no moral value, it's pure self-absorption, self-aggrandization, egomania, lack of empathy, callousness, etc. These are the anti-social mechanics. Notice how if you have those traits, and **input** self-awareness, suddenly, nothing changes. It's *still* an anti-social machine. There's no magical consideration for the other, when you inject self-awareness into a psychopath. So what is the purpose of no self-awareness in evolutionary terms? The purpose is to protect the psychopath from the repugnant(to us) and inconvenient(to them) truth-- they are a moral monster. If you *know* you're a monster, and you're also self-concerned, and an egomaniac, you can't effectively **be** a monster-- it hinders a psychopath in the same way fear does. You must have low awareness of what you are. It's the same as fear-- if you have fear, you can't express psychopathic behavior efficiently for evolution to reward. These all function similarly.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625024885,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h3itdqt","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o76sts","locked":false,"name":"t1_h3itdqt","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h3irzo1","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/o76sts\/update_on_ban_policy_for_trolling_brigading_andor\/h3itdqt\/","retrieved_utc":1627559226,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Wouldn\u2019t they just say\u2014 hey I\u2019m different?\n\nBecause the kind of \"knowing\" you may be imagining may be linked with a kind of self-reflection. Remember there's none of, there's just this awareness that one is a monster, that one is in a relationship to victims in a certain way, in the way monsters are. It knows what a monster is. It knows how monsters are treated. It knows how desperate a being can be when its life is threatened by a monster. It knows how much hate there is, towards monsters. It knows all of it.\n\nBut the one forbidden knowledge for a monster(to function well *as* a monster), is the knowledge that *they* are the monster.\n\nOf course, this is just a hypothesis. It remains to be seen if this is truly the way things are. Perhaps evolution will generate new monsters who relish in the knowledge they are monsters. These are competing evolutionary strategies of the psychopathic phenotype-- but i think the un-aware monster robot has an edge. Low awareness helps in other areas too-- such as a lack of awareness that one is lying. Deception is an obviously powerful evolutionary move, but it is expensive-- to deceive a being needs to perfectly mimic, and for humans telling lies, this includes microexpressions, tones, body language, and so on. This is too costly. Evolution's shortcut is causing the deceiver (such as the psychopath, or the narcissist) to believe their own lies. This means they tell perfect lies, insofar as they believe. \n\nMonsters work the same way-- they can be perfectly monsterous by not knowing they are. Evolution instead invents a narrative. They are a \"hero\". A \"vigilante\". A \"savior\". Getting \"revenge\". Getting \"justice\". These are just domination modes, and narratives. Monsters can't know they're monsters to properly engage in these modes, or the narrative becomes incoherent. The unconscious monster strategy is therefore more versatile in evolution.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625026421,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h3ivxa2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o76sts","locked":false,"name":"t1_h3ivxa2","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h3iv1di","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/o76sts\/update_on_ban_policy_for_trolling_brigading_andor\/h3ivxa2\/","retrieved_utc":1627559078,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

This is because there's an innate asymmetry between power at the top of a hierarchy, and at the bottom. People can vote and organize, but due to power always being an expression of dominance phenotypes, and dominance phenotypes always being \"evil\"(Should be obvious, although there are plenty of memes going around in game theory to obscure this inconvenient truth-- being the most skilled player and the most skilled cheater, that is, least detectable, means you have the greatest advantage, and in the totality of an evolutionary game space, it simply means \"you win\"-- that's power, that's what sits at the top until something bigger comes a long).\n\n I say \"evil\" here because they cheat in the only relevant way possible-- ethically. So someone willing to torture someone has more moves available in the game than someone who would never torture someone. Or someone willing to torture everyone simply to display [dominance](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/), again, has an advantage over someone who would never do such a thing(in a one-on-one, the former would beat the latter, assuming they're a sufficiently skilled cheater in general, which includes deception, camouflage, and other variables that are constantly improved via [selection pressure](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) to give us what I'd informally call \"the psychopathic phenotype\".)\n\nSmall tangent, but there are plenty of adaptive strategies to deal with this ethical dilemma of evil winning. You can invent lots of memes that say \"The good guys win\" or \"God is on our side\" (an oldie, still used today everywhere, we're all breastfed on this stuff and enjoy this content as adults unquestioningly), or you can do it intellectually and say ethics doesn't exist or isn't real or has no meaning or is arbitrary(popular and wrong), another one in the former category is trying to come up with a concept in game theory to say \"Good wins\" or \"Cooperation wins\"(not sure how popular this is, especially the former), or you can simply be a psychopath(or anti-socially adjacent individual-- on the spectrum, narcissistic, etc) and double down.\n\nThe asymmetry mentioned earlier is as follows-- it's possible for a group of people with a decentralized enough system to express their decentralized power(the sum of which would be something we'd call \"decentralized\"), but eventually the way this works is, locally, the winds of entropy make it easier for the malicious skilled player(the psychopath at the top of the pyramid-- the apex psychopath) to express their order on the system. This is because the entropy is actually an *advantage* for the domination machine to create its centralized order, due to the dynamics of cheating vs. not cheating. It's easy to see that if two people build houses, and in this game, having a house is crucial, and one person is not a cheater and would never be malicious to another person, yet another is salivating at the thought of burning the other's house down and is skilled at hiding it, then this bad actor *simply* wins. By the time the good actor rebuilds, the lead the other one has is immense, and they can may even be able to just burn it down next time with even less effort. The same is true when the game is \"un-even\", with the apex psychopath. Such a being would express its dominance over the environment in a centralized order. The reason why this *doesn't* work from the bottom of the pyramid, is it's just too messy down there, and these individuals generally don't cooperate due to being domination machines. They can get some decentralization in play, maybe, temporarily, but all this does is strengthen the dominance machines at the top. It's possible to vote for the right candidate as a lone actor at the bottom of the pyramid, but it's even easier to infiltrate one political party(or both) and manipulate them for your needs. That's real power asymmetry.\n\nEntropy eventually causes local pockets of order to collapse, but it takes a *really* long time. I don't really believe in revolutions, I believe power, throughout history, has been like a fire that has been fanned in secret and obscured and changed colors. Some people think the fire goes out , and a new, \"Good fire\" or \"better fire\" takes its place, but I believe this is a naiive fantasy representation of what really happens. Another fantasy is in reverse: \"There was *once* a \"good fire\" or \"better fire\", but now things have gone down hill\". It's simply always a pyramidal structure, no exceptions.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625089321,"distinguished":null,"edited":1625089996.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h3lz10h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_o266cz","locked":false,"name":"t1_h3lz10h","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_o266cz","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/o266cz\/why_i_do_not_believe_decentralization_is_possible\/h3lz10h\/","retrieved_utc":1627552364,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Sadomasochistic tribal warfare isn't our undoing in any way, it's the *reason* we won't ever be undone except by an alien species more mentally ill than we are.*\n\n\n*(Who we need to actually pose a threat to by the way-- extremely unlikely that such an even matchup would occur, it would be very clear dominance in objective terms, but perhaps not subjective terms, which is why modern politically oriented individuals think they are fighting some sort of \"revolution\" when the idea is an absolute joke, and these people are really just pawns of the elites).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1625093269,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h3m79dv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oavjli","locked":false,"name":"t1_h3m79dv","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_oavjli","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/oavjli\/i_believe_we_should_learn_to_see_or_at_least_look\/h3m79dv\/","retrieved_utc":1627551912,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}
