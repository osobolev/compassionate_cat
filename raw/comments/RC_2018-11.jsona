This results in elderly and those with terminal\/extreme illness to live their lives to maximum misery until a natural death. Who are the financial beneficiaries from this scenario?(What are the total resources consumed during this process - who are the first degree beneficiaries, ie, hospitals, drug companies, etc) Lastly, who ultimately benefits(ie, the State. Tip: Think in terms of micro scale, and macro scale, that is, a single elderly person's slowly forced to die naturally in a hospital\/nursing home, vs. the totality of a first world superpower's elderly dying)\n\n* On planet Earth, you have historically not been allowed to do some very peculiar things. For instance, the laws against relations between two genders. This is a puzzle that's not simply dismissed by \"Religion can get silly\". Religion certainly has enforced the taboo against homosexuality, but it is the state who benefits. For every homosexual in your future superpower(No matter who it is, Russia, China, U.S., )  you have one less soldier in your army. You have one less family man, procreating, and generating future taxpayers, workers, and many more future lineages(One man creating a family makes many more families, in the big picture, even a few dozen homosexuals are a significant problem for a budding powerful nation over the course of many generations).\n\n* Lastly, the response to the image in the post: You are generally encouraged to do two things: **prolong life at all costs** , and **proliferate** at all costs. As if life was not full of enough pain and suffering for many non-disabled people, if you have the exceptional bad luck of being born disabled, you are forced to live in this prison by your parents, doomed to be confused, doomed to not even pepper your misery with occasional human joy, doomed to not be able to meaningfully express your pain when you have pain. Your parents too, are deeply unlucky people. The man who did this for his son has the bad luck of living in a world, and a state, that makes a virtue out of keeping disabled children alive at all costs. You are given incentives as a parent to do this - You get praise from society. You feel as if you've done an ultimate good. But have you? Any sane survey says no. Yet we find ourselves in this strange world. Again, who benefits from all the disabled children being kept alive today? The costs for raising these children are considerably higher than raising a normal child.

I fully acknowledge what you mean in that, life growing up was traumatic, stressful, and needlessly a struggle in a way which it wouldn't have been, had you simply been given some more mentally healthy parents. It certainly never feels like it \"makes up for it\", but you're quite wise now to how subtle toxic interpersonal dynamics are. You can fully appreciate just how normal looking your family could have seemed to be from the outside - that's how subtle something so nasty and harmful to childhood development could be, and you are fully sober to that reality. The approach which has worked for me to dissolve much of the regret and anger, was to acknowledge my mother as a victim of a disorder. If you or I had the brains and psychology of a full blown narcissist, we too would be helpless to behave in the ways which define narcissistic personality disorder. We would be egomaniacal, entitled, self absorbed, lie effortlessly, manipulative, abusive, all for our own personal gain. But we're hopefully not enough of these things to define us as narcissists. Our parents however, weren't so lucky. **This does not defend what they did - it was still awful, and in a just world, these people would be prevented from being around children or vulnerable individuals if we simply had a perfect system in place**. But the point is, when I viewed my abusive parents from the perspective of psychology, it was liberating. Of *course* they couldn't have acted other than the way they acted, they were narcissistic, right? This leads to acceptance, it leads to a kind of letting go that dissolves resentment and regret and anger, for me personally - it's the only mentally healthy approach as far as I'm concerned. Dwelling in anger and regret will torture you until the end of time. This is also quite different from the more saintly forgiveness; you don't(you **shouldn't**) forgive someone who has consistently done terrible things to you. But understanding that they couldn't have possibly done otherwise, than act out their mental disorder, is a psychologically healthy view and opens the door to healing.\n\nOn the topic of children, I think it's very common for people who come from abusive homes to want children, to \"get it right this time\", but I find that as a poor justification for children. It's less about the child, and more about some sort of revenge for your own neglectful childhood. I very much relate to this desire of having kids and getting it right, but I know that the abuse left a wound that would probably make me unfit of being a parent. Raising a kid is a lot harder than it sounds.
