But yes, I agree, a person who wishes harm towards another person, is simply a bad person(in that context-- that is to say, this is bad *behavior* and likely says something about who that person is), regardless if this thought exits the privacy of their mind or not.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1627923338,"distinguished":null,"edited":1627923713.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h7g4unu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ouicah","locked":false,"name":"t1_h7g4unu","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_ouicah","permalink":"\/r\/Utilitarianism\/comments\/ouicah\/being_bad_without_acting\/h7g4unu\/","retrieved_on":1652436022,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Utilitarianism","subreddit_id":"t5_2revn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Utilitarianism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

You are trained to lie as a child, you are lied to, you are supposed to lie to maneuver through the insane rules that parents and teachers place on you to \"not get into trouble\" or \"get some advantage\", and all this does is make anti-social individuals in our world who are intellectually deceptive later on in life. Every discussion you've had with a person where there's tension and no possibility of resolution on some level stems from dishonesty and an unwillingness to admit that one can be wrong, because there will often be thought-out arguments from the other side where the opportunity to say \"That's a fair point\" exists. It's through dishonesty that we conveniently ignore these opportunities, because we don't care about changing our minds. We care about ensuring our random bullshit narrative survives-- very similar to the obsession with one's genetics surviving. It took me a while to discern the difference between pathological truth telling and not lying, because it's possible to cause more harm by saying what you believe to be true in certain instances, but the attitude where I deceive myself or others intentionally is gone and it's such an immense relief to not have to micro-manage my lies like I would do as a child\/young adult. Even the most pointless, stupid lies in basic situations, simply being honest in these situations and actually projecting a version of reality to others which you think is accurate, is night and day from the kinds of lives the average person leads, where they maintain such complex lies that even they feel a kind of de-realization and lose track of what honesty is and what the lie is.\n\nThe first one is what had the most impact in my ethical attitude towards others. No matter how upset I am about something negative caused by someone, it could be anyone, a stranger on the internet, someone I interact with daily in person, a famous person I suspect is malicious, a high profile criminal case, etc-- the moment I remember that no one made who they are, and they're just a self-contained algorithmic pocket of physics that helplessly expresses \"they-ness\", it's impossible to simultaneously be a) honest and b) angry\/moralizing towards this person. It's like hating a bear because it attacked a wildlife photographer who got too close and triggered it to attack. It just makes zero sense whatsoever. And then you see this attitude in others, in youtube comments where say, criminals are sentenced for some horrible crime, and you see a comment like \"I hope they get raped in prison :)\" and the mechanics of the irrational hatred due to a *forgetting* of the fact that free will is a harmful fantasy, becomes crystal clear.\n\nThose are the two main ethical gamechangers imo. Simply being totally committed to honesty, and never forgetting that free will is an incoherent fantasy idea that doesn't do any good for the world, but does immense harm.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1627945408,"distinguished":null,"edited":1627945604.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h7hitmd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_own4kx","locked":false,"name":"t1_h7hitmd","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_own4kx","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/own4kx\/living_is_more_enjoyable_now\/h7hitmd\/","retrieved_on":1652433100,"score":10,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

To be a misanthrope is to be confused\/forget certain facts about reality. It's like being a miscetacean or a misavian... it just makes zero sense, because no being sits there in the void going, \"Okay I'm going to be born into this universe as.... a predatory animal! No wait... I'll pick a human being. Or maybe... some highly aggressive ape species, like a baboon\". Things are just thrown into existence. In light of this fact, how much sense does hating *anything* make?\n\nA lot of antinatalists still fall into that \"cognitive dissonance\" category, because they simultaneously acknowledge the ethical scenario we're in, they acknowledge the world is such a bad place that it's conceivable that bringing things into existence here is a very serious ethical matter, but at the *same time*, they will blame people, or make statements like \"humanity deserves what it gets\". Or moralize people for not recognizing the \"wisdom of antinatalism\" when no one can account for the presence or absence of any ethical position they do or do not hold. It's *as* insane to me as... finding some dog kennel where the dogs are all viciously abused for the purpose of a dog-fighting operation, recognizing the dog as a morally relevant being whose abuse is a moral crime, *rescuing it*, but then *beating* that dog because \"it should have known better\" or thinking: \"If it really deserved to not find itself in an awful scenario, it should have not found itself in such an awful place\". It's just a narcissistic and psychopathic attitude.\n\nThis is why one of the biggest areas for moral progress in the antinatalism community would be a total end of all the idiotic tribal nonsense, including the out-grouping of \"natalists\".

The problem of reality is much deeper than humanity, which is why misanthropy always struck me as superficial, unsophisticated, or just a more socially accepted narrative for anti-social types. I'm not claiming all misanthropes are sociopathic, but it's clear that a lot of these and adjacent philosophies attract angry\/malicious individuals who would be callous to other humans if they were just given the power and no negative consequences.\n\nIf aliens created some civilization on the other end of this galaxy, then there'd be every reason to expect that civilization would also follow some kind of dominance hierarchy structure. It's hard to imagine for them to have *not* arose through the same sadistic domination game that life\/civilization emerged on Earth with.\n\nThis is simply what happens when you get beings that mindlessly replicate and compete for mates and resources, humanity is just one arbitrary point in this system. If you have a) entropy b) finite resources c) replication , you get strategies that essentially \"cheat\", and the best \"cheaters\"(the lions that eat things alive are \"kinds\" of cheaters, [this](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) is another kind of cheating. [Psychopaths](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/gCjhRBv.png) are another kind of cheater with an entire \"cheater tool-kit\" which contains the predatory nature of the lion with the camouflage of the caterpillar) win the game. Winning then means replicating the entire algorithm of cheating, in the form of passing genes to the next generation, and these new beings enjoy all the power and benefits the parents enjoyed. It's like with human wealth, once you're rich, you get richer.\n\n That's how power works in nature as well, even down to the laws of physics, like with stars, or black holes. Once you have a large mass, you have a lot of gravitational pull. And then you pull even more things towards you, and you have *even more* mass, which means more gravity, and so on. The same is true for egocentrism. The most egomaniacal humans \"fake it until they make it\". They become billionaires if they already weren't. They attract the attention of mates, of investors, of social circles. In a conflict, they never go \"Hmmm, I guess I'll just drop this silly disagreement\". No, they double down. They insist they're right. They make *sure* they get their way. That's how egocentrism functions, it's a kind of \"superficial winning\" via \"gravitational force\" that sucks everything into their presence through sheer force, and then these aggressive domineering self-absorbed \"Cheater genes\" get another go at things once they have children, reaping the benefits of the parents \"gravitational pull\".

Except in anti-social cases, it would be an antidote to the suicide itself-- that's how awareness modifies behavior.

One really has to suffer immensely to even hope to get it, and it's clear any time you're speaking to someone who does, because they will try at least somewhat to show some type of reverence towards the limits of human misery, and take the question of suicide and suffering seriously, and admit that some pain thresholds(physical or psychological) simply cause suicide, in a \"physics\" sense, like sufficient humidity *causes* precipitation.\n\nThat being said, I think the valid concept this person would probably agree with is that at least in principle, there are generally alternatives to suicide, and ways of navigating reality that don't cause net harm or deprive the world of at least a single subjectivity that knows intense pain(this is the minimum tragedy that exists with every suicide, because it robs the world of a voice that testifies to how bad this place can be). In practice it may be different, and all it should take, if this person you're speaking to is honest, is to get them to imagine a torture chamber scenario where a sadist aims to make their life as miserable as possible, but offers them a suicide cocktail or a noose to end their pain. It's as simple as \"turning a dial up\" conceptually-- turning a pain and torture dial up, and mathematically, quantifiably(in principle), each person will eventually kill themselves rather than endure another day of torture.\n\nOnce someone admits this very self evident fact, all it takes is acknowledging that some lives, for instance, the [worst lives](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KDf_aL_7QHI), can conceivably be bad enough to cause one to desire to just go to sleep and not wake up. Some lives are even worse in psychological terms than the example in the video, while being nowhere near as bad physically, because of the lack of quality relationships, or due to feelings of intense ostracism, bullying, etc. A human being will generally endure intense physical misery, but it's the psychological misery that I think tends to lead to most suicides. This person is correct that at least in principle, there are solutions to psychological misery, and even physical misery. Dealing with suffering is a skill that can be trained, and some are simply not fortunate enough, either in being exposed to this idea, having a favorable view of the idea once exposed, to being oriented to develop this skill if they know the methods. All of this is a matter of luck, and there's no magic \"pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps\". All we can really do is encourage people to develop the skills, and also accept that not everyone can be helped.\n\nBut it's through an ignorance of [how bad life can get](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez) for some human beings, that causes this attitude that the person you're speaking with holds, the attitude that says: \"*Nothing* is worse than death\". If there was a way to simulate a set of first-person experiences of the worst tortures to such a person, then doing so would probably cause them to fall to their knees in tears, mortification, shame, and so on. There'd be an immediate upgrade in their brain, and a shift to at least grant that while we don't know what death is, or if consciousness survives death, or if death is subjectively good\/bad in any way, we *do* know with certainty that some experiences on our planet are so bad that there's no way to ever say \"Life is a gift\" in some wholesale sense, and these worst experiences can cause one to beg for the mercy of death. Once again, recognizing this or not is a matter or luck(or sometimes, bad luck, because a bad enough threshold in life is required to deeply understand this).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628050018,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h7n188c","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oxdpv1","locked":false,"name":"t1_h7n188c","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_oxdpv1","permalink":"\/r\/BirthandDeathEthics\/comments\/oxdpv1\/a_discussion_with_a_real_religious_prolife\/h7n188c\/","retrieved_on":1652421515,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BirthandDeathEthics","subreddit_id":"t5_3hdt91","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BirthandDeathEthics","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

And I think so *even* if the data is \"true\". I say true in quotes, because of the way I see the concept of progress as it'll appear to us. I more or less believe that there's a misunderstanding in popular ideas in game theory(like those endorsed by the putanumonit blog for instance), and psychopathy \"wins\" all games that have no referee(so, it wins our universe, it wins the dominance game of the entire universe), this is due to selection pressure and entropy. Selection pressure means that skilled cheating will be the best strategy given enough time(again, *only* due to the fact that there is no referee, like on Earth). \"Cheating\" here means simply being unethical, and you can define that however you wish. Ethics must *mean* something, linguistically, and it must mean being constrained in some way. No matter what your ethical rule orientation is: rules themselves, virtue, utility, NU, and so on-- if you're ethical you're by definition constrained. To be unethical however, is to be almost totally unconstrained. This is why a psychopath can run a charity for children for instance, and spend decades doing profoundly beneficial things for children, while simultaneously, raping and murdering children in a hidden dungeon. But an ethical person **cannot** do this-- they are constrained by rules. Being constrained means less moves are available to you, and you're strategically disadvantaged. Psychopathy wins.\n\nSecond, there's entropy, which is like the nail in the coffin. If the game was winnable by good actors in any way, even a small chance, entropy ensures that evil wins. This is the \"state of the game\" that says, it's easier to break something than to fix it. It's easier to set something on fire, than to repair the damage of a fire. It's easier to spread a lie or smear someone or spread a false rumor, than to undo the damage(reputational or otherwise) of the lie. Entropy is the tradewind that powers the sails of evil, while hindering true progress. It's like not just having the overpowered character in the video game, but the mechanics of the *stage* you're playing on, also perfectly favors your ridiculously overpowered character.\n\nYet... okay, let's assume this is all true-- why do we see all of this progress then? Why did we overcome slavery in much of the developed world? Why do we have better social safety nets? Why are less people starving? Why are we operating under democracies rather than monarchies? Why do we no longer torture people in brazen bulls?\n\nThese are all functions, I would argue, of power which can afford to produce such luxuries. Even though evil does win, and the game is ultimately zero-sum, there *are* non-zero sum elements which benefit everyone. This non-zero sum space is the space of progress, and it's what misleads **every** individual involved in game theory today who would call themselves an optimist to any degree. One of the core features of psychopathy, or evil(interchangeable), that is produced after evolutionary timescales and selection pressure, is [camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv). Camouflage is a function of power. To successfully camouflage means that you cannot even be identified. If you cannot be identified, you cannot be destroyed or attacked with intent. With good enough camouflage, you can even hide in plain sight, and no one will understand your nature(this is why sociopathy, or overt callous evil, will reduce along our entropic gradient, but psychopathy, will only distill and become more powerful-- one is overt evil, the other is covert evil). \n\nIt's not an accident that all of our mythology and fiction has largely been unchanged in how it depicts evil-- it's always cartoonish, and this is true thousands of years ago with stories like the Enuma Elish, where evil is some big evil dragon, to today, where we have figures in black armor(Darth Vader, Sauron, The Night King, etc), menacing figures, demonic figures, sharp teeth, horns, this is how we portray evil, we raise children on this representation, and it's not an accident. This is a function of the camouflage of evil in our world-- a world where evil intends to remain camouflaged does not benefit from endless memes about evil appearing deeply good or unassuming and constantly plot-twisting into \"Woah, whoops! The good thing, the beautiful thing, the hero, the philanthropist, Superman, Batman, Jon Snow, whatever-- Woaaaaaah! Turns out they're **pure fucking evil incarnate**! Who saw *that* one coming?!\" So instead we have memes that aid in camouflage. Even a movie like \"American Psycho\" is so cartoonish that it fails to show the *banality*, the plainness, the [**everyday-ness**](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6wvvjDb.png) of evil. Good wins in our fiction, which is totally strange and contrary to the way things work in reality-- and the winners of our non-fictional reality are always inventing narratives how they're the good guys, when it's so obvious they're *merely* the winners who produced immense atrocities and deceptions to win.\n\nAgain, just look at David and Goliath-- it's directly contrary to reality. David never wins in real life. Instead, Goliath walks up to him, shrugs off the stones, and breaks his neck before rubbing it in first like the sadist he almost certainly is. These are in fact the *winners* of our reality. This is how [power](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall) plays out in nature, yet strangely all of our memes are fabricated in such a way as if they were made with the intention to brainwash us that reality is the *opposite* of this cruel dominance mechanism. This is, again, not an accident. It's part of the entire dominance of evil that is ingrained in human culture. Power is the difference between the ability to [burn someone alive](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Giordano_Bruno#Imprisonment,_trial_and_execution,_1593%E2%80%931600), and be helpless in *being* burned alive. We're already familiar with endless psychology that reaffirms that our brains are not oriented to reality, but very often to bullshit narratives, because bullshit narratives are better for survival(this would be true and intuitive if our reality was hellish, which I argue, it is). So psychosis is adaptive, but so is psychopathy, and this meme has not yet and probably will never truly enter the discourse. The winners are insane and unethical, but we also can't *see* it in any reliable way because we're all deceived basically(a scientific claim because it's falsifiable in principle, but perhaps not in practice, so here people can split hairs depending on how deeply they value pragmatism), and it can't be any other way, and this is true currently with respect to dominance of earth in 2021.\n\nAll progress is therefore a kind of bone thrown to the masses. Dissidents are assassinated in places where they are an actual threat to the power structure, like the current Belarusian activist who was found hung in Ukraine recently. That's what power looks like when people actually pose a threat to power. In areas where power is less desperate, it can afford plenty of \"progress\". If anyone here was a sufficient threat to a 1st world superpower, it's simply true they would be \"neutralized\" promptly(imagine how *quickly* this would happen if you were a severe threat to national security), and this is what power means. To achieve this level of power *demands* an evil phenotype, for the reasons explained earlier-- one simply loses while being deeply ethical to an equally skilled version that is deeply unethical and can skillfully cheat. Sometimes this \"skillful cheating\" is trivial, like inventing a patriotic narrative to justify [torture](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/) or something [horrible](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/transcoded\/7\/7a\/342-usaf-11034_Medical_Aspects-Hiroshima.webm\/342-usaf-11034_Medical_Aspects-Hiroshima.webm.480p.vp9.webm). [Controlling narratives](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ff6TIOf.png) becomes effortless if power is given enough time to crystallize, and this has been achieved for thousands of years when the smarter monkeys realized the power of religion, and has only grown in sophistication to the point of being almost unrecognizable by the average person. Of course, the fact that it's taboo to point something like this out, is also not an accident, but a feature of the futility of being crushed under the weight of power. If **everything** I've written were true, you could shout it from the rooftops until you lost your voice, and you would achieve **nothing**. You could also shout the reality of unicorns from the rooftops, and it would achieve nothing, so it may not seem like a particularly profound point, but it's still valid and deeply convenient for power that something like this exists.

Intense evil + power is hidden, which means science can probably never solve this problem let alone identify it because it's too pragmatic and slow of a tool to tackle something that can adapt to its careful and delicate methodology, and science is the best chance we had, meaning it's hopeless and not resolvable. Progress is not genuine, but rather a strategic move on the part of this evil, because while it's true that by nature, a world where evil wins is a hellworld, evil still benefits from a covert hellworld over an overt hellworld. It also benefits from not even understanding that it *is* evil-- evil is most effective when it lacks self-awareness, which is why these sorts of traits are found in psychopathy, they make a more effective monster: fear is turned off(lacking fear is lacking a kind of unawareness as a strategic expression-- there's something *to* fear, otherwise it would be nonsensical to say someone lacks fear. It's like lacking a fear of werewolves. It's not meaningful to lack such fear. Lacking a fear that what you're doing is wrong, lacking a fear that what you're doing is dangerous, when this is precisely what you are doing-- **this** is meaningful, and clearly benefits a serial killer like Ted Bundy and agents who decide where nuclear weapons will be used alike), risk aversion is low\/turned off(again, *lacking* awareness of risk = more effective at winning than an equally skilled agent who is deterred by risk, evolution rewards *proactivity*, which is why passivity and indecisiveness is unsexy in humans, but proactivity and \"go-getterness\" and decisiveness, is admirable and sexy), egocentrism(egocentrism, self-aggrandization, these are all kinds of distortions in awareness that have strategic benefit for the psychopath or monster) so too with self-awareness. Being totally lucid to the fact that one *is* a monster, is not as effective as simply being a monster with a bullshit narrative, or no narrative and just being a callous robot that dominates everything in its path like some black hole that you can't negotiate with through sheer force of its gravity. That's what wins in our world, and Pinker's entire thesis simply cannot account for this sort of psychopathic dominance phenomenon, even if **everything** in the video OP posted criticizing Pinker is wrong, *even* if Pinker is right about all of the data on progress. The best-case scenario(or perhaps Steelman, in some sense?) of Pinker's thesis, if he recognizes this problem, is just a kind of shot in the dark that eventually ages poorly due to some 21st century atrocity, and then on a meta-level, we can all go \"Ah, so this *is* a hellworld\", and that mere acknowledgment after the fact that Pinker said things really are getting better would solidify the sort of deeply pessimistic case I'm making.\n\n(As an aside, the fact that our **most sophisticated ethics** has made it so conversations about good and evil and morality are practically incoherent, and you can get serious academics who could say something like: \"Well how can you *really* say torturing a little girl's feet with a blowtorch for no good reason at all through sheer sadism is *really* wrong?\" is also, not... an accident. Moral anti-realism , meta-ethics, moral nihilism, and even Hume's facts\/values dichotomy, these are all functions, intentionally or unintentionally, of a world which is shaped to make evil comfortable vs. uncomfortable-- the dark truth is all humans are oriented towards such evil strategies, which could only be the case after everyone on the planet alive today is descended from a long line of millions of years of successful rapists, sadists, and murderers, something we take for granted on a daily basis-- so the entire human genome is attempting to benefit from this \"ethics is brittle\" strategy, even though by doing so, **everyone** loses in the most crucial way possible-- even the most evil and powerful thing alive on Earth\/Our universe).\n\n&gt; A bit beyond perception's reach\n\n&gt; I sometimes believe I see\n\n&gt; that life is two locked boxes\n\n&gt; each containing the other's key.\n\n— Piet Hein","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628054610,"distinguished":null,"edited":1628110446.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h7n8gkn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ox693i","locked":false,"name":"t1_h7n8gkn","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h7n8g1i","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/ox693i\/is_pinkers_case_for_progress_mistaken\/h7n8gkn\/","retrieved_on":1652421102,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

He gets a lot of hate from pessimists of all stripes, and I think this is just malicious or founded in ideologically averse emotions rather than something warranted. I would never say Pinker thinks \"everything is fine\", that's a horrible misrepresentation. Rather than assume Pinker is just a slave to cherry-picking the most optimistic data possible, I wonder to myself if his books and thesis on progress aren't a kind of meta-level reverse psychology, and that he is familiar with just how evil the dominance scheme on Earth is(I can't imagine someone as intelligent as he is, is unable to extrapolate this from just soberly, and with a total commitment to honesty, looking at historical data and making some basic acknowledgements about natural selection). So I think this could be a strategic move where when things finally take a dramatic turn downwards(as I believe they will, and as I believe any intelligent person who isn't lying to themselves should worry about, given basic facts, like how callous and evil and manipulative and deceptive-- all part of the psychopathic phenotype, humans are, and how powerful technology gets with time), Pinker has sacrificed his career by at least attempting to narrate the best case scenario.\n\nIt's sort of like when you want your favorite sports team to win, and you insist that the team they're against, who you despise, \"seems to be the winner already\" before the game is even decided.

Maybe it's just devil's advocate, and we should find it strange that really just a small number of intellectuals dare say \"Things are getting better sort of... don't uhh.. worry so much, everyone\". *This* should tell us something.

As an aside, it's interesting that the project of ending animals getting eaten alive seems more realistic\/feasible in certain respects than the project of ending factory farming, which is purely a human enterprise. This should tell us something important about our species.\n\nIt's interesting also that we're ignoring the case of helping humans in the same contexts.

To be in a position would mean holding power over human predators, which... makes no sense, because then one would in some sense *be* the predator of the predator, or the power dynamic would be reversed. This realization has further implications about our species(and how dramatic the power dynamic in it may be), but it can also have implications with the main subject of resolving wild animal suffering-- the question of if we live in a deeply, fundamentally predatory environment, or not, could be relevant to such a project or broader ethics.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628064500,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h7nknr2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oxkli9","locked":false,"name":"t1_h7nknr2","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_oxkli9","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/oxkli9\/what_can_and_should_we_do_to_help_wild_animals\/h7nknr2\/","retrieved_on":1652420386,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Many big cities seem to be comprised of a) people who just want to mind their own business and want to be left alone or b) people who exploit naive people, with malicious intentions. This is the sad truth of reality, and this claim can be made in the absence of any disorder or delusion or psychosis.\n\nSo just rest for a second in the sanity of that fact.

We can just investigate this idea calmly, right? If it's true, we **really** want to know. It's not even a scary idea to us at this point, it's just *bewildering*.

This, he interpreted, was symbolic of the Holy Trinity. It's worth realizing that he didn't interpret this in some Buddhist or Hindu context. The number \"3\" almost certainly has *some* significance in the totality of those religions too, I would bet. Yet, the white guy in the United States instead went with a Christian narrative. Go figure. After dwelling on it for a day or so, he then wrote:\n\n&gt; “I knelt in the dewy grass as the sun rose and surrendered to Jesus Christ.” \n\nThis is *without* any psychedelics, and in an educated and accredited scientist. We know the brain does things like this, so there's no reason to believe it *can't* be possible through psychedelic experiences, or epilepsy, or psychosis.\n\nThat being said, I find it hard to believe that your psychedelic experiences were of no value at all. Just because there is endless bullshit out there, to me, doesn't mean there's any reason to believe all of it must be bullshit. The brain is no different sober than under the influence of certain drugs that are capable of producing meaningful insights(contrary to meaningless insights, like say, someone using marijuana, feeling intense epiphany\/profundity, writing down their insight, and then discovering, upon sobering up, that it's all just nonsense-- this is bread and butter of the beginning stages of  psychedelic science-- an experimental group and a control group).\n\nIf we're *just* talking about the \"beauty of reality\", then there's no question, if you try large doses of these drugs enough, and in the right settings, you *will* reliably experience otherworldly beauty that words will fail to capture. These experiences are so widely reported, and so easily accessed by those willing to explore the substances, that there's no reason to doubt this being true. And their subjectivity is just as valid as any other sober experience-- we're *just* experiencing a chemically induced representation of reality at **all** times, whether we've taken a certain drug or not. People's testimonies who report profound beauty to me, are just as valid as those who report that we live in a hellworld. Both are subjectivities whose realities are included in the totality of our reality-- both experiences really did happen, and there's a \"hashing out\" that needs to be done in light of the big picture. Ideally, we'd have some technology where you experience my phenomenology, I experience yours, and then both we both go: \"Ooohhhhhh.

A deeply neurotic, deeply seeking, deeply craving person-- someone who is utterly at the mercy of the monkey brain, may very well be as you describe. They will seek happiness, and the harder they seek it, the more fleeting and out of reach it will seem. Boredom specifically is interesting, because if you think about it, it really is a *kind* of mental illness. It's a demand for stimulation. It's a state that says: \"This here? This is **not enough**. I need more. I need excitement. I need fireworks. I need novelty. This current experience is insufficient.\"\n\nThis is a kind of neurosis, and a lack of attention. Why attention? Because if you just wake yourself up for a second, slap yourself awake, splash some water on your face and just try *very hard* to notice the gravity of reality, you will notice that boredom seems like the *least* appropriate state of mind. Anger, sadness, anxiety, fear, bewilderment, curiosity, these all seem like appropriate responses by comparison. But boredom is ... just utterly nonsensical. Here's what we can realize if we suddenly slap ourselves awake:\n\nWe are *currently* conscious. We are *currently* having an experience, and we have **no fucking clue** what any of this is. What *is* this? What is this experience? What is this place? Is this reality as it appears? Is this the Matrix? Are we Boltzman brains? How can we even know? What happens when this experience ends? We're supposedly on a large sphere in space, of a scale we hilariously fail to comprehend, and even this may not be even the tiniest fraction of the totality of reality. How *mind-blowing*...\n\nNow just contrast this with the mental state of your average bored child right now:\n\n\"Siiiiiigh. So bored. Nothing to do here. Nothing at all... no movies... no games... no people.... nothing good to eat... nothing fun to do.... this **sucks**\"\n\nNow what if you just showed this person the horrors of certain [experiences](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez). What does it mean to *still* be bored after realizing this happened to that child? There are all kinds of experiences, they don't necessarily need to be negative. There are some profoundly positive experiences too, since this is not the worst hell the laws of physics allow for. What does it mean to be bored in light of an awareness of these experiences? Or of the gravity of recorded history, all the wars, all the torture, all the innovations, all the best and worst things that were never written down or photographed that will blow away in the wind? It requires a kind of failure or deficit of attention to *still* be bored and unmoved. It *says* something about the bored person.\n\n&gt; There is no need to be an ascetic in order to be satisfied. For the ascetic is not satisfied until he rids himself of pain and suffering. You can linger all you want under a tree but you will never be satisfied. \n\nThe ascetics and similar types actually aren't about *ridding* themselves from suffering, but changing the orientation to it. Because suffering is simply a foundation of existence. It's the aversion to it, that causes much of it. Fear, avoidance, anticipating the pain, these attitudes do a lot of heavy lifting in making the nature of the suffering bad. Without noticing, we do this, in the form of thoughts, our imaginations. A meditation teacher described his time in India where he went up to the mountains to the avoid the heat of the Indian plains(120 degrees at the highest). To get there required something like a 17 hour bus ride. He mentions that the Indian buses are notoriously bad-- poorly built, uncomfortable, bumpy, crowded. He had a seat above the crank-case, from the engine, and the fumes were suffocating him. And he mentions his thought pattern-- that he couldn't imagine 17 hours of \"this\". So he said he first began by committing to just meditation practice on this bus. At first, according to him, it worked. But eventually, the engine fumes and extreme turbulence of the rickety bus and the bumpy roads, got to him, and it became unbearable. So finally he just asked: \"What if I relaxed? Instead of keeping all of this unpleasantness out, what if I allowed it in?\" And he claims a magical transformation occurred, where the preconceptions, the anticipations, the aversions, were causing much of the suffering, and even though the experiences were still fundamentally unpleasant, the difference between the neurotic, averse mental state, and the state of equanimity, was dramatic. So in not running from suffering, the outcome was the *solution* to suffering.\n\nInterestingly enough, the same is true for happiness. It's a cliche by now, but it's simply true: If you seek happiness, you will never get it.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628123499,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h7qvcn8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oy486m","locked":false,"name":"t1_h7qvcn8","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_oy486m","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/oy486m\/you_will_never_be_satisfied\/h7qvcn8\/","retrieved_on":1652413452,"score":16,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It's through association, feeling like we are a \"Me\", and that the things happening in our consciousness, mostly thoughts and emotions, **are** what we are.\n\nIt's simply a fact that we aren't our thoughts and emotions. How could we be something which we can observe? What *we* are, is something prior to what we call \"our\" thoughts and emotions, since we can observe them. But the natural state is *not* observation, but rather as you may know, association.\n\nIt's true that this association, this self-model, causes much suffering, and pointless suffering that has no utility I know of. It's not like dissociating from the suffering will make it go away in the most clear cases. So if someone is suffering from the pains of terminal cancer, it's not like simply not identifying with their pain makes the pain magically go away(it can, but there's no guarantee-- it will almost certainly still be quite bad on some level). But what purpose does associating, and therefore dramatically increasing the suffering by feeling like something you call \"You\" is now the victim, the target, of the pain, achieve? Does it give one some special warning that they're dying from cancer which they don't *already* know? No, of course not, it is truly just pointless and unnecessary misery, and it should be avoided in a skillful way.\n\nBut now notice the potential utility. Imagine being angry or depressed. Suppose it's genuine. Suppose the negative emotion is something like being betrayed by a spouse or partner. And one is angry, depressed, and so on. It can actually *hurt*, and by that I mean, it can deprive, it can confuse, blind, and so on-- to deeply identify with this emotion. One can just spiral on for hours, days, weeks, months, and have this anger\/sadness reoccur over and over, and cause on to fail to recognize certain truths of the matter. Like:\n\n* What is the *sense* of having this much resentment? (This question generally *cannot* be asked in the throes of intense negative emotion)\n* Is the person my negative emotion is directed at, somehow *deserving* of this emotion? Could they have done otherwise than they did? (This question generally *cannot* be asked in the throes of intense negative emotion)\n* Is there sense in strongly pushing against the idea of a relationship with an unfaithful person falling apart? Why would we *want* to be with this unfaithful person? (This question generally *cannot* be asked in the throes of intense negative emotion)\n\n...and so on. There are countless insights like this that being captivated and identified with thoughts and emotions robs us of, and more attention is the antidote to this. More attention is *just* more data, and an identification with things always means a lack of attention, because association is a kind of \"zooming in\" and pretending like we are much more than we fundamentally are, when we cannot possibly be these things. That's why attention is called an attention \"span\", it's a breadth, a zooming out and simultaneous appreciation of details\/data points without losing any clarity.

Discussing the problem of depression and anxiety(and certain facts about its nature, that these appear as thoughts and emotions that can be *observed*), has *triggered* depression and anxiety *itself*. Isn't that amazing?\n\nNeurosis really does appear to be at the forefront of our problems. If our problems really do have solutions, then it's inconceivable to think that being captivated by a state of neurosis could somehow be *helpful* in resolving these problems, no? Wouldn't it be powerful if we could approach our problems with a mental state of true clarity and attention, that isn't bothered by negative states of mind? Likewise wouldn't it be the worst state of mind, the least helpful, if our problems really are as they appear, to have to face these problems while in the least resilient mind states, which are most fragile and sensitive to thoughts and emotions? And if our thoughts are both real, and have no solution as a result of some tragic state of the world, even here, would it not be best to have that state of clarity, and wouldn't it only be a greater tragedy if we suffered *extra* on top of unsolvable problems, by being the perfect victims of thoughts and emotions?\n\nTo be captivated by various neuroses, is to kind of be distracted, if you think about it. Because the subjectivity of being captivated here, is living **in**, and living **through** these states, as if they **are** us. Just think back to some feeling of anxiety or dread you've felt. Some pit in your stomach when you realize something like a potential worry, and take it seriously, even though there may not be any hard evidence yet for this worry's validity. It's night and day to feel completely subsumed by this negative feeling, vs. simply *watching* this feeling. If you're entertaining what I'm proposing to you, you can instantly intuit what I'm saying, because you're *watching* it right now. You're imaging this feeling, you're superimposing it in your consciousness *without* living through it as you once did. Just close your eyes and think back to what dread feels like, from your current position of relative ease. When viewed from afar, it simply doesn't ragdoll you around like a bear thrashing a salmon around in a river, presumably, right?

That is all. It's certainly not *easy*, and it requires training, but it's possible. And the difference between simply observing, and *living*, identifying with these states of mind, is just night and day, because these states practically vanish if they are observed with clarity and precision.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628142900,"distinguished":null,"edited":1628144608.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h7rvb2f","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ovsss3","locked":false,"name":"t1_h7rvb2f","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h7rgaxd","permalink":"\/r\/Schizotypal\/comments\/ovsss3\/id_rather_have_terminal_cancer_and_feel_alive_and\/h7rvb2f\/","retrieved_on":1652411349,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizotypal","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlzo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizotypal","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

However, the highly counterintuitive truth about the nature of belief, from core beliefs to mundane ones, is that we don’t have different degrees, or strengths, of belief, because belief is certainty. As with Spinoza’s theory of belief formation, closer analysis reveals that this theory actually isn’t contrary to experience. Although, also as with Spinoza’s theory, the theoretical and practical implications of this theory are profound.\n\n&gt; And also as with Spinoza’s theory, not only is belief certainty, this is so simply by logical necessity, and therefore not because of the nature of the human brain — a second highly counterintuitive aspect of this theory. As I stated above, our capacity for belief is obviously due to the nature of the human brain. However, there isn’t anything about the human brain which causes belief to always be certainty. Instead, the certainty of belief is simply a logically inherent, and therefore inevitable, feature of belief, for any form of intelligence. And so the idea of degrees of belief is actually logically impossible.\n\nIsn't this a sort of blurry semantically, at least potentially, when one says things like \"I believe I'm eating an apple\" \/ \"I believe it'll rain tomorrow\"? These are treated identically for the purpose of this thesis, but in linguistic and practical terms, these statements really can have larger gradations of meaning\/nuance, like, one cay say \"believe\" and *really* mean \"believe\" in one sentence, and then one can say \"believe\" and *really* mean \"strongly suspect\" or \"weakly suspect\" in another sentence. This second sense is not counted for the purposes of this thesis, is that right? I think this isn't nitpicking, because when someone is truly *pressed* on the subject, at least in crucial philosophical respects, they'll usually admit some type of gradation of belief, no? Even when the belief is apparent, and one is mid-bite of the apple, one could ask the person: \"But do you *really*, with **total** certainty, believe what you're eating is an apple right now?\" And you could often get people to budge with some kind of philosophical skepticism, like: \"Hmm... well... I suppose I *could* be hallucinating right now.\" Would this kind of admission change the binary of belief towards \"disbelief\" in your eyes?\n\nSide question: You say belief is strangely absent from the psychological literature as a foundational concept, but what about neuroscience?

T\n\nI'm not sure we're on the same page after reading this, because the witness 'you'(it's not even a you, at that point) is simply aware of things that to me seem hard or impossible to achieve in something like Alzheimer's or psychosis. I'm not sure if you're saying that *all* experience is by definition delusional, as some kind of philosophical claim, but I suspect not, because then words like delusional lose their meaning. There's a reality to be or not be in touch with, right? And there are subjectivities and vantage points that are more\/less in touch, and this is heavily based on awareness. Some disorders or conditions are going to severely hamper awareness, like the ADHD you mentioned earlier, and most degenerative conditions. There's quite a lot of science recently on this, but our conversation is pretty heavily encapsulated just by the Wikipedia article on the ['default mode network'](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Default_mode_network), where Alzheimers, meditation, autism, etc. are referenced. So really, the problem here, at this stage of the discussion, is identifying if there is a fact of the matter to being in touch with reality. If there is, then certain neurological functions will by definition have *some* orientation function to that fact of the matter. How things appear to me right now is, the default mode network is significant in generating certain hallucinations and delusions. This would make more sense if we grant that we've evolved to hallucinate\/be delusional as an adaptive strategy, and then certain drugs, \"disorders\" , \"diseases\", damage to regions of the brain, **any** condition or experience or action that \"Shakes up\" the default representation of reality, may very well in fact make on *more*, rather than *less*, in touch with reality. And this is exactly what we see if we look thoroughly at these things. It is the \"normal\" that is sick, and then \"sick\" that is sane\/healthy, in other words. This is only untrue in the context of evolutionary values, where being sick is in fact healthy, and being healthy is sick(in terms of being in touch with reality or not), but this is because evolution produces beings that are adapted to hellish environments, which is also what we see(both the beings, and the environments) if we just carefully look at what is in front of us.\n\n&gt; 3. In certain circumstances, encouraging someone to identify with their \"inner witness\" in order to better manage their distress can be counter-productive.\n\nJust a small clarification here because the language we sometimes need to use here is burdened, but once one reaches the vantage point I'm describing, there's no identification going on-- it's just pure experience. So here the analogy in what you're saying, to me, sounds like saying \"Encouraging someone to get emergency first aid when they're bleeding out severely can be counterproductive\". Things can go wrong when one pays closer attention, one can suffer more, for example, or one can recall traumas that were \"successfully\" coped with(I would call this unsuccessful in the ideal sense, because it's really just a ticking time bomb in a context of a lack of training), but even going to the gym can be counterproductive. One can make a mistake and get injured in a way that takes decades to return to one's original fitness level.

I remember as a child people would just \"Throw me in\" to things, this is \"learning by doing\", right? And I remember my experience was just complete confusion. What am I doing? What am *trying* to do here? What's a good move, and a bad move? Specifically I remember I was thrown into Chess. Family members, friends, school mates, I'd often have the opportunity to play chess, but no one *really* sat me down to really get a lightbulb to go off in my head. I'm the sort of person who needs that lightbulb, or I'll get nowhere, even if I'm just grinding away, nothing will stick for me. I need a conception, a philosophy, and so on. You can't just tell me \"The knight moves *this* way, the pawn moves *this* way, if you lose your queen you lose\", and say \"Now just play\". That's like... the *worst* method, for me. It could be an amazing method for someone else, someone who needs just a blank slate and then lots of \"doing\".\n\nSo with the Feynman technique and a skill, writing on the skill could still be beneficial, but it could be paired with something hands on. So maybe juggling is the skill you're trying to acquire, so you're outlining a philosophy of juggling.

Because there's a distinction between conscious intention, and just knee-jerk, inattentive, \"lost in thought\" style of operating through thoughts and behaviors, which we could also call \"intention\". This is what distinguishes the baseline human experience from something like psychedelic experiences, highly traumatic events, \"the zone\", states of mind achieved through rigorous attention training\/introspection, etc. There's no \"free will\" so they're both just physics in action, so again, the semantics burden us when we refer to\/try to distinguish between *real* intentions\/choices, and inattentive\/mindless intentions\/choices, but there's still this distinction on some meta-level. It's possible to intend something with profound clarity and lucidity(and recognize intentions *as* intentions with the same lucidity), vs. basically sleepwalking into intentions\/choices(with little\/no awareness that intentions are even arising).\n\nSo we may intend to... get a specific drink from the fridge, but we may do so in an utterly lost, inattentive way. It's also possible to be totally lucid in this same process, to have total clarity of the urge to get a drink, to be aware of the thoughts that occur in the mind that deliberate between beverage a and b(rather than have these thoughts arise without even recognizing they're arising, and have them automated). It's like opening a door while sleepwalking, versus being so acutely aware of opening the same door, and so alert, that you're opening the door with such attention and precision as if your life and wellbeing depended on it. These are two dramatically different modes of experiencing the same environment and much of the same behaviors.\n\n&gt; During the psilocybin experience I did become distracted by pulling out my phone and it caused the magical experience to suddenly cease.\n\nSure, but probably not during the *peak* of it's intensity, right? This is what I'm trying to bring attention towards as being powerfully captivating to the point that fringe, trivial thoughts or behaviors(like thinking about snacks, or pulling out ones phone to check social media) appear completely absurd to consider. They're jarring and surreal in their absurdity, to me.\n\n&gt; In the example of Fritos are you suggesting it is a known reward? This is where it gets tricky too. I think psychedelics disrupt known reward processing. It’s intellectually recognized as familiar but that doesn’t mean it feels like it usually does. I think the disruption is occurring on a non intellectual level. Like the hedonic responses are re calibrated or reset. “Unfiltered reality” people will often describe it as. The filter is a way that our attention is programmed based on our learning and familiarity with the set of stimuli. It’s as if we don’t have this learning which allows us to attend differently to things and also escape chronic compulsive urges to attend familiar rewards.\n\nNot necessarily a known reward, it was just an example of some trivial bullshit the brain comes up with, to contrast it with something profoundly *un*-trivial. It's hard to dispute this when we're speaking of \"reward-processing\", simply because anything that's un-rewarding won't be a coherent example here. So even in the case of something like... an intrusive thought, say. Let's say the thought of being tortured just randomly enters the mind during peak psychedelic captivation\/ego-loss. It *could*, right? But the context of its subjectivity here would at minimum be dramatically different, I imagine. But even with 'intrusive thoughts' we could twist this as some type of 'reward processing' in some ultimate sense, I don't know, maybe as a part of some masochistic strategy? But if this were the case, psychedelics would still conceivably be able to disrupt this as reward processing too. The point is, almost anything can be fit into \"reward processing\" if we really try hard enough, but clearly, some things truly are dead-ringers for what a \"reward\" is, and psychedelics will seem to much more reliably disrupt that. But yeah, the \"filter\" you're describing reminds me of what you wrote here:\n\n&gt; A new study suggests that psychedelics may be associated with reduced confirmation bias, more specifically, the bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE). The researchers found that psychedelic users were better at integrating evidence when presented disconfirmatory evidence. On the other hand, stimulant users had increased bias. Perhaps our normal biases guide us to make the ordinary conclusions we hold\n\nA big hint here I think is in the stimulant users *increasing* bias. This confirms a lot of observations I've had before. Purely anecdotal, but I notice more egocentric types, narcissists, psychopaths, and so on, have a very high affinity for stimulants, like cocaine and methamphetamine. I notice people who have a high affinity for anti-egoic drugs, like psychedelics, are less narcissistic and psychopathic. And even if they did possess a meaningful amount of these traits prior to use, these drugs can reduce these traits in a lasting way. Egocentrism is deeply related to bias, and non-egoism is by definition the opposite value, it's an openness, a willingness to change, a non-stubborness, a tacit admission that one can be wrong, an agreeableness, etc. A psychopath really is characterized by the opposite of all of this. High egocentrism, which is like a kind of gravity... a non-negotiable nature. To have behaviors, especially violence or harm be forced on you for the psychopath's benefit, requires those traits: certainty, low agreeableness, along with no fear, callousness, etc. Deception is another cornerstone of bias-- biases are basically unconscious or semi-conscious deceptions, and deception is foundational to psychopathy and narcissism(these are the best liars in our species, and to be the best liar requires self-deception, because this is what happens to produce the most convincing lie). So the drugs seem to have certain synergies with the sort of person one is, at least in this narrow case of specific stimulants and specific psychedelics. I'm sure outliers exist, of course, but there's *something* here, I think. I don't know many people personally who have used lots of stimulants, but just in a casual sense, I've noticed that just as psychedelics can reduce anti-social traits, stimulant use(I'm speaking about \"hard stimulants\") seems to *increase* anti-social traits.\n\nEdit: Oh, and I completely forgot-- **boredom** is such a big one. Psychopaths are deeply prone to boredom, but on the flipside, they get *really* excited when they are stimulated. It's like... predatory animals, in general, the whole \"bloodlust\" thing, the \"craving\" thing. I notice this even in subtle ways, like.... I don't know, watching the crowd at a sporting event and seeing a fan just *losing* it. That whole, \"LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\" attitude, that's very *subtley* in my eyes associated with psychopathy. That's the trait set that *tends* to want cocaine. That's not the trait set that's going into the redwood forest to take mushrooms, if that makes sense. Boredom really is torture for the highly egoic being, they *need* stimulation. They *need* something to shout \"LET'S FUCKING GOOO\" about, whether it's a sport, or just ... murdering someone. You've *seen* this type of person if you just get around enough... they're just *manic*, self-aggrandizing, and you *know* they're the sort of person who'd just *dart* for the cocaine. And you *know* they're the sort of person who would be callous or domineering or even sadistic in their traits. Cocaine and Methamphetamine are like... *the* anti-boredom, ego-masturbation drugs. One can make the *case* for psychedelics, and it can appear this way at first glance, but really it's pretty distinct from stimulanets due to the potential for bad experiences and anti-egoic phenomenology that often comes with these drugs.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628210194,"distinguished":null,"edited":1628319494.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h7vlcaj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oxrx8r","locked":false,"name":"t1_h7vlcaj","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h7sxio2","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/oxrx8r\/escaping_the_cube_explore_vs_exploit_directing\/h7vlcaj\/","retrieved_on":1652403475,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It doesn't matter if there's a predator or not, all that matters is, the phenotype results in successful propagation of genes. If you're insane while doing it, evolution doesn't care. It just cares about the genes passing. If that means you [burn some of your larger genetic tribe's children alive](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moloch) which causes your genetic tribe to be terrifying psychopaths in the face of others, evolution is perfectly okay with this. This is also how suicide bombing can be adaptive behavior , even though it immediately terminates the genes. Your children could be showered with status culturally, so maybe it's a tradeoff where certain genes win in the long run at the great sacrifice of many other genes. This is also how child abuse likely functions-- child abuse triggers coping mechanisms, where as child care(we pejoratively say \"coddling\") causes children that are more sensitive to a hellworld. Evolution doesn't care if parents simply sternly, but with clear genuine love, tell their child:\n\n&gt; \"Okay Billy, we're now going to gym! We're going to get real strong and tough so we can tackle everything life throws at us, okay pal? Just to warn you, it's going to hurt, okay? It's not going be fun sometimes, but we'll make it-- and I know you'll get through it. I love you *so* much-- don't forget that.\"\n\nverus\n\n[Give their children the life of Gabriel Fernandez](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez). Gabriel's mother *knew* she was dating a psychopath. Yet she stuck around, and not only abused her child in the worst ways possible(it's unclear who the bigger psychopath was), but she stuck around someone who joined her. How does this behavior make sense? It's not supposed to, when you understand that it's just a strategy.\n\nEvolution is just trying to create a simplistic approach to creating \"hell-survivors\". The whole point there was the same as every other being in this space-- throw them in the meat grinder, and hope that something magically slips through the razor sharp gears and *doesn't* get ground up, and then that thing will hopefully be \"sexy\" enough to pass its genes along. This is why \"I survived the meat grinder\" attitudes tend to be egoic, high confidence, go-getters, but also callous because they endured psychopathic torture-- and psychopathy, as we know, is well oriented to abuse the next generation. This is how the cycle continues-- not just because it's abusive, but because abusive tends to be *sexy* to our species.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628216163,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h7vxid7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oyvy6l","locked":false,"name":"t1_h7vxid7","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_oyvy6l","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/oyvy6l\/humans_as_animals_that_survive_and_reproduce\/h7vxid7\/","retrieved_on":1652402767,"score":21,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

People that believe they have control over situations and experiences that affect their lives tend to have better outcomes. If you think you can pick your bootstraps up, you're likely better off than someone that doesn't believe they can.\n\nThere's some nuance here that I agree and disagree with. I agree that people have to *do something* to solve any problem-- that I think is obvious, and this is true whether determinism is true or false, or if free will is true or not. But believing one has control in certain senses, like \"pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps\", even though it could have utility, or motivate someone, causes harm in general I think. Because then we are pretending like we have free will, and this opens to door to also moralize others in this same way, or call them lazy, or expect them to have this new fantasy notion that one believes they too have. It also opens the door to the concept of punishing someone, because now they're failing to pull themselves up by their bootstraps when you're convinced they can do so(despite it being a lie we simply told ourselves). \n\nThe problem is people conflate determinism and fatalism. Things are determined, and you can't change freely change anything about that, but that is subtly different from things being *utterly futile* where it made no difference if you did nothing, or did something-- **that** second idea, is fatalism, and that idea can be thrown away while still not lying to ourselves or moralizing others on the basis of falsehoods like free will or telling them they can magically \"pull themselves up by their bootstraps\" when this idea is plainly absurd in light of what we know about the universe. Believing lies that are useful in some narrow sense should be avoided because they also cause much harm in the greater sense, and the lies are not even necessary because all one needs to do is appreciate the nuance between determinism and fatalism.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628231939,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h7wnuqo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oso1su","locked":false,"name":"t1_h7wnuqo","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h6q6e3w","permalink":"\/r\/Destiny\/comments\/oso1su\/why_do_we_throw_out_all_determinism_and_become\/h7wnuqo\/","retrieved_on":1652401243,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Destiny","subreddit_id":"t5_2qnvz","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Destiny","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

The \"It's not even a 'you' \" part? That refers to the loss of identification when enough attention is paid(either through drugs, traumas, profound experiences, introspective training, \"flow states\" etc). Subjectively, (again, I distinguish this from the objective truth and the utility of pointing to subjects and calling them \"you\" or \"me\" -- that is not something that needs to be disputed at all I think), the sense of a self can disappear, and again-- there is either a fact of the matter here, or not. One can say \"Oh but that's just a hallucination\", but if we grant that there's a fact of the matter, then it's not absurd to suggest that the sense of self *itself* may be the illusion(it either is, or it isn't-- this is what a fact of the matter means here), if we hash these contradictory subjectivities out. I don't believe that they're simply equally delusional, for example. That fact of the matter could be nuanced, or it could be paradoxical(in one sense, there could be a self-- in another, deeper sense, more meaningful, more profound sense-- there may not be a self), or it could be deep, or it could bear exceptions, or maybe the answer is straightforward-- but in my eyes, it *can't* be just equivalently delusional-- that seems the *least* likely to me, and the least logically coherent. Let me know where the point of contention is if there still is one.\n\nIn case it was something else in that sentence, then this is easier-- it's simply true that someone suffering severe cognitive degeneration likely can't enjoy the benefits of \"Olympic\" levels of mental acuity, right? This is a privilege of only the sharpest minds in existence, and there's no reason to think there aren't objective gradients here like with everything that is measurable\/quantifiable in principle. So, someone with severe Attention Deficit Disorder, can be said to have objectively bad attention. The worst such case in existence at the moment of me writing this sentence, has the *worst* case of poor attention in practice-- we need not know anything specific to make this claim, it's simply self-validating. Intuitively, this means everyone else in existence maps onto attention gradients, using all kinds of standards-- attention in practice, attention in principle, attention historically, aggregate attention, etc-- and there are objective, verifiable(in principle) answers here too. There's a \"Lionel Messi\" or a \"LeBron James\" of mental acuity, right now on planet Earth. And we don't need any special omniscience to know they almost certainly aren't suffering from a severe case of Alzheimer's. That's all I'm trying to say when I say \"seems hard or impossible to achieve\".\n\n&gt; Here we agree (I think!). Using the alphabet as a template, there is a continuum from A, commonly-accepted facts on one extreme, moving by gradations into M, (mal)adaptive delusions (context dependent), and on the other extreme are Z, maladaptive\/personal-existential-threat delusions. \n\nNice, I think we do agree, yes. I really enjoyed that alphabet gradient especially, and I just want to nitpick slightly because I think all of these beliefs( to be clear, they're possibly *lots* of things), but speaking purely in evolutionary terms for a second, all of these beliefs are simply strategies for genes to replicate. I like that you made a belief in a personal god a potentially adaptive or maladaptive belief-- one can use different values to change the nature of the utility here. So perhaps from the perspective of evolution, believing, irrationally, and with great costs, that a personal god exists, it could be adaptive, but from the perspective of ethics, it could be a disaster. And this can change too, depending on the scope\/scale. So perhaps the belief in god really jump-starts civilization and gets a species all the way into a type 1 civilization, which even gets us to sophisticated ethics, but the artefacts and vestiges of the belief in the personal god that did the heavy lifting(at great cost), somehow, in the long run, end up being a *tiny* unnoticeable bug that can possibly be directly traced to some wide-scale ethical catastrophe. I'm not saying this is necessarily the case with humans, this is just one possible way to look at how these maladaptive\/adaptive beliefs can influence the species when we zoom into the individual\/micro level, then zoom out to the evolutionary level, and in macro-timescales, or just \"swap the lense\" on the values system.\n\nEven the \"I can fly\" works this way. I know you're imagining some sort of persistent belief(And here it would only be a matter of time and sufficient topography for death to be guaranteed), but it easily falls into the second \"M\" category if we just make this an intermittent belief. It could give a human the courage to make a leap where fear or simply an appreciation of physics would be a sufficient deterrent, at the cost of one's life. But yeah, there are probably beliefs(or memes) in this space that are *explicitly* bad in evolutionary terms(and also in ethical terms). Not sure if you're familiar with Nick Bostrom but he has this intuition tool for civilization-ending technologies, which he calls an Urn. The urn contains marbles, that are white(representing benevolent technology), grey(which either come with pro's and con's, or are benign), and black(which unambiguously lead to the end of civilization or humanity or life-- not sure of the specifics here). So he says that we've only pulled white and grey balls so far. But he suggests that there's no reason to think black balls don't exist, so it's simply a matter of time, if we just keep inventing technologies, and their power increases exponentially(as it obviously appears to be doing... bronze age tools all the way to nuclear weapons, etc), then we will eventually pull out such a black ball. I think memes work the same way on the micro-level\/macro-level in evolutionary terms(and ethical terms, from another vantage point). Our brains generate memes, and then they're either adaptive, ambiguous\/come with costs and benefits, or explicitly result in a Darwin award. And this project could be zoomed out on as well and be seen as \"road to success\" through many ancestors(or a road to failure). I'm referring to this when I wrote about the \"tiny unnoticeable bug\" earlier-- a belief in a personal god for instance *could* be a \"black ball\", and we simply don't know it yet\/may die before it even surfaces fully.\n\n&gt; Your example is really more analogous to \"Encouraging someone to meditate when they're in the throes of psychosis can be counterproductive\". Both the bleeding-out individual and the maladaptively deluded individual have severely compromised personal agency. In either case, the Samaritan would take measures on their behalves to ameliorate their situations.\n\nWell no, because no one is doing that in the same way no one is telling someone who is bleeding out to \"make long term dietary changes\" or something like that. Perhaps this is where the analogy only is analogous in the narrow sense: It captures how even if our prescription of a solution is *technically* correct-- it can backfire. I was not speaking about the urgency of the situation when I chose that analogy, and here, of course, no one in *any* emergency is ever going to benefit from meditation-- it would be like telling someone pinned under a rock to \"just work out and get really strong\" in order to lift the rock off of themselves. So we have to be distilling some crucial aspect of the prescription to meditate in our analogy. In what *way* is it counterproductive, going back to the original claim? Can it psychologically destabilize someone further? Yes, of course, but emergency first aid can also sometimes make someone's critical condition worse, too. Can it simply be the *wrong* prescription, in the case of an emergency? Yes of course, no one would suggest it in the peak of a psychotic episode-- it's simply a gradual preparation. There's also the fact that, as almost anyone who has benefited from meditation knows, that *telling* other people they should take training the mind seriously because of how beneficial it is simply decreases the chances they will do so. \n\n&gt; I agree with you that meditation\/cultivating a sense of detached awareness can be extremely beneficial in coping with the existential predicaments arising from philosophical pessimism, with 2 caveats:\n\n  &gt;  [they...] should be closer to M than to Z\n  &gt;  [...] the process can sometimes bring into conscious awareness other realizations that can cause further distress.\n\nWell we can go even farther than that-- even people who are firmly on gradient location \"A\" can get nothing from meditation, but I think you could be trying to say that \"A is too cold, Z is too hot, M is just right\" -- and that may be true, but I think how well one tolerates this has to do with other personality traits, and not necessarily one's conventional\/adaptive\/maladaptive beliefs. It has to do with traits like openness to experience, a desire to examine the mind, a desire investigate whatever is true(one must value the truth and also value experience as a viable avenue to what is true). Also important would be no special aversions to the idea of \"introspection\" and all the baggage that tends to come with \"Eastern mysticism\", etc. One could be dead center on M, and one could already be very mentally rugged to the point that \"further distress\" would be a trivial thing for them, but if one is the sort of person to think: \"Meditation? Pfft-- that's all just new-age guru bullshit!\" then the project is probably doomed from the start.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628236327,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h7wt5qp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oy0a82","locked":false,"name":"t1_h7wt5qp","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h7wntyg","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/oy0a82\/got_into_buddhism_but_the_pessimist_sentiment_of\/h7wt5qp\/","retrieved_on":1652400917,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

And don't you prove my point in your own story? \n\nThat's unclear, because the concept of satisfaction can be difficult to capture using language. There's one representation here where it's like some egoic grasping towards some goal-- and that specifically is as close to the antithesis of these values as one can get. It's one thing to want to rid oneself of the ego and all the things that are associated with it: craving, wanting, aversion, suffering, and so on-- and another to just go in circles, desire something, and never get it, because one is always desiring in that second case. So it's possible to endeavor to attain something that can be called enlightened, and never get it. It's also possible to convince oneself they've gotten it, and be wrong.\n\n&gt; You said the meditation teacher finally was able to cease his distress through relaxing and \"allowing it in\". Isn't this a prime example of just being satisfied with our current situation?\n\nYes, there's an ease here which causes a reduction or removal of suffering. But this is the flip side of egoically grasping at or pushing something away. All desire can be dissociated with if enough attention is applied, so the paradox you're pointing to, where it's *always* founded in desire, isn't always the case(although it definitely can be-- like with the earlier example where someone believes they're enlightened but really they're just spinning their wheels in craving and aversion). There's a real difference between equanimity and \"desire-&gt;satisfaction all the way down\".\n\n&gt; Meditation if I may add is just a avoidance, although it may help in multiple ways, but when it comes to human nature facing and accepting our fate is the true release from suffering.\n\nThat's actually a core value to the philosophies associated with meditation-- to *not* avoid(there are exceptions of course, you should certainly avoid... I don't know, grabbing the underside of a hot pan with your bare hands). To notice avoidance and how it relates to suffering. We can again play the semantic game of \"You're just not avoiding it *to* avoid it\" but there's a real difference in terms of *meaning*, between suffering in a way that feels like one is drowning in a turbulent sea without any ability to swim, in pure panic, and simply laying back and floating in this same turbulent sea, at total ease.

This *why* I suspect the subcultures that often expose certain inconvenient ideas regarding gender(\"red pill\" , \"incel culture\", and so on), are partly so ostracized. It's actually evolutionarily adaptive behavior to collectively, unconsciously, say \"This stuff\/these people are bad!\"-- because one is actually strengthening the human genome if they keep a secret that this is the way human gender dynamics work.\n\nIf you think about it, humanity will \"win\" the game by maximizing psychopathic traits. If it reaches some utopia of pure kindness and good will and what not, then it's just a matter of time for the jacked sociopath aliens to come by on their ships, with their genes(Or whatever their replication strategy is) oriented through millions, or perhaps billions of years of perfecting sadism and evil, and just rape, murder and torture the entire human race. This is how evolution rewards \"the nice guy\"(and therefore, the \"[nice species](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall)\") So by creating a taboo around anything that exposes the truth of what is attractive to humans that have been churned out through millions of years of rape, torture, sadism, deception, wars, etc(this is simply the sad truth of our species)-- one is basically, to use the language of these sub-cultures, \"a simp\" for human DNA.\n\nThere's also I think, to steelman the stigmatization, an anxiety around misogyny here, where people assume that simply pointing out that women are often attracted to evil men, puts some moral burden or blameworthiness on women, or makes women worthy of contempt. I think that idea is completely untrue-- that would just make women additional *victims* of this scenario. It would be completely irrational to blame women or hate women for this, in the same way it would be irrational to hate or blame... anything, really, that didn't author itself and was simply thrown into messy, unethical circumstances with little room for solving problems as a function of one's nature and the bad incentives one is oriented towards.\n\nThere's a final point here, and that is that someone could argue that it's not the case that women tend to be attracted to evil, but rather that they tend to be attracted to [power](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gYG_4vJ4qNA), but I would argue that power is synonymous with evil. Power wins by definition, and to win in game theoretical terms, one needs access to a large number of \"moves\" in the \"game\". To have limited moves is a disadvantage, and that's weakness. This should be obvious. If two equally skilled \"players\", are unequal in the single category that one has access to all moves in the game, and another has access to limited moves, if you just let these two players play the game out(such as, through millions of years of genetic selection games), then the player with the large moveset will win(again, all other things being equal here). \n\nNow ethics, is by definition, a constraint in one's \"moves\". To be unethical, is to be largely unconstrained. You could do as much good as you want as evil, because it serves at minimum to camouflage your evil-- it has a strategic purpose. A philanthropist could give kids in poverty iPhones and scholarships and enrich their lives tremendously, but then could also rape and torture children in a dungeon beneath their mansion, no problem. That's compatible behavior for evil. But goodness **cannot** do this-- that's what it means by definition to be ethical, it means being constrained, no matter what ethical conception one operates under(barring the ethical ideas that say there are no ethics, of course). Goodness can *only* do good, so goodness is limited, and therefore weaker. Which means immense power is synonymous with immense evil on some level, at least in principle(as in, it *can* be evil if it chooses), but very often in practice(it **is** evil as a description of its nature and behavior), because to engage in these moves requires a certain nature, a certain trait set. The being who is good, but *can* do the evil move 'this one time', but struggles and hesitates because it so deeply goes against their nature, is at a disadvantage again to the being who is simply evil and doesn't hesitate to perform the winning moves, no mater the ethical character of the move.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628307192,"distinguished":null,"edited":1628359989.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h80lwnq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oyvy6l","locked":false,"name":"t1_h80lwnq","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h7x71y5","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/oyvy6l\/humans_as_animals_that_survive_and_reproduce\/h80lwnq\/","retrieved_on":1652392947,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

There are plenty of bad people who get attracted to psychiatry, and the larger community of psychiatric pharmacology is not insane to be suspicious of, simply due to the sheer power of producing insane numbers of profitable drugs that can change human behavior.

Earth, and our universe, it should be clear, is not *that* good of a place, right? It's quite bad, quite often. There's [torture](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/), there are [evil people](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cmp43eP.png), there's callousness and a lack of empathy in general, if you get a horrible life, there's no long line of people seeking to help you, right?(And if they do help, it's usually something cynical, like they're doing it for some social benefit to themselves, right? But even this is rare) So it's a bad place, where we were thrown into. And it functions around certain rules. One set of rules is evolution by natural selection, and these rules are just strategies that genes randomly attempt, via mutations, for the purpose of making more, and making adapted, genes.\n\nIf it's a bad place like we understood earlier, then we know that strategies for \"surviving badness\" will be rewarded by the genes, even though they cause suffering to people. Child abuse is in this category. A parent abusing their child is like the genes trying to perform the idea \"What doesn't kill you makes you stronger\". If emotions can be exploited by evil people(if a sadist tortures you, and you feel terror, anxiety, despair-- you will be more of a victim than if you're already an emotionless shell. or if a school bully says something cruel to you, and you are highly sensitive, it will hurt a lot more than if you've been through decades of abuse due to child abuse). So the end result is child abuse becomes a strategy for the genes to try to promote survival in a hellish world. Of course, the genes are too stupid to understand that the world is *already* bad enough, and there's no threshold understanding that the genes are expressing. There's no \"Okay, u\/Wen_juin has had enough. It's time to simply be loving and supporting from now on.\"(It's so *obvious* that this is the correct strategy, but the genes are too stupid to be this creative, and therefore the gene-carrier often can't break free from the genetic programming, just like a sadist torturer can't generally realize \"Wow... what I'm doing right now is... is wrong...\" ) It's a [robot expressing genetic strategies](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall), and they are blindly and robotically followed so they seem [\"buggy\" and nonsensical](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/sillydetailedagouti) if we use logic to criticize them. \n\nA lot of hatred, resentment, \"What could have been\", \"I deserved loving parents\", etc-- can go away if one understands that every being is simply thrown here and is running on buggy code that is oriented towards evil behavior *purely* because the \"game state\" is corrupt-- the fact that nature is evil and rewards evil strategies resulting in a fundamentally evil world.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628376011,"distinguished":null,"edited":1628376412.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h83u31d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ozvtyt","locked":false,"name":"t1_h83u31d","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h82hh8c","permalink":"\/r\/2meirl42meirl4meirl\/comments\/ozvtyt\/people_why_do_you_hide_your_emotions_my_emotions\/h83u31d\/","retrieved_on":1652386147,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"2meirl42meirl4meirl","subreddit_id":"t5_3c0nx","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/2meirl42meirl4meirl","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Biblical ideas very frequently fail to survive a child's scrutiny-- I remember asking my Sunday school teacher why the dinosaurs were absent from the bible. I knew then that there were these huge creatures a really long time ago(A couple hundred million years ago). And strangely, the Bible just started with some garden and Adam and Eve. What about the dinosaurs? After asking, I was removed from the class into the hallway. The priest twisted my ear until I expressed pain and curled back, and told me not to ask so many questions.\n\nYou can't twist an adult's ear in any practical way, so we're left entertaining ideas that are clearly bullshit , invented to control people, invented so tyrants and head priests and kings could rule brutally over peasants and cannon fodder infantry who had to die and suffer miserable lives doing hard work. What lie could you tell these unfortunate social classes? Well, you could first say that there's a loving God, and that things will be okay, because this is all going to not suck later on. Then you can go on: \n\n\"Oh but... one small catch. Unless you don't behave like we tell you to. :) If you misbehave, then you'll be tortured forever, way worse than now. So get to it, break your backs harvesting those crops. Go in there and fight for the kingdom or tribe who God supports.\" \n\n\"Oh, and if it gets too rough, you're not allowed to kill yourself. That's just cheating, you'll be tortured forever if you do that. Oh and, no sex that doesn't result in more offspring-- all of that isn't okay. We-- I mean, God, wants you to only make babies when you have sex.\"\n\n\"What's that? How do we know all of this? It's in the book God helped us write. He's perfect, so it contains no errors.\"\n\nIs it... not obvious, that it was like stealing candy from a baby, for the ancient tyrants and propagandists and manipulators, thousands of years ago, to just invent bullshit and socially engineer huge numbers of peasants and soldiers who would essentially get tortured? They knew what they were doing, that's why they enjoyed privileged positions at the tops of the pyramidal structures we call \"hierarchies\". They were more cunning, and more brutal. These are the people who would burn you alive for entertainment, or for [questioning the religious dogma](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Giordano_Bruno#Imprisonment,_trial_and_execution,_1593%E2%80%931600). Their children were born into wealth, and had the domination genes, and then carried on the dynasties of the rulers. \n\nJust look at George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush today. The father was the head of the CIA, and served as president. Both graduated from Yale. Both were Christians, the father was quoted as saying atheists were not to be considered U.S. citizens. The son was a creationist, and expertly played a moron. What are the odds, that such a person was this stupid? Or was this just an expression of dominance, because fooling the average person is as easy as saying a few words incorrectly, or [holding a book upside down](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/sJEJ8zs.png). This was in the *moments* of planes being flown into buildings which would serve as the \"provocation\" of two long wars, and a domination over areas rich in oil(oddly coincidentally, both Bush and his Vice President were ambitious and aspiring oil tycoons). All in the context of a *literal interpretation* of the Bible. It's sort of like the Donald Trump strategy-- be such a fucking cartoon character, and be characterized by such absurdity, that your critics can't point to a single thing about you. It's just cheating, right? Have you ever argued with someone who says nonsense after nonsense or changes the subject constantly, strategically? That's what this, except as a strategy of a persona. You can't win versus that, because they're not playing by the rules, that's how sophisticated the deception is. This is what wins in the world, and religion has been a primary tool of domination for these dynasties. \n\nWe should be shifting the conversation towards *that* fact of the matter rather than trying to apply logic to obvious ancient propaganda, because we're sort of just... intellectually dying... every time we wonder something like, \n\n*\"Gee, well if God is so powerful, and so good at the same time, why would he bother with all of this torturous bullshit in the first place? Why would he put innocent people through this for the crime of two people in garden? It just makes no* *sense*...\"\n\nIt's like when you play with a cat's attention with a laser pointer. The only reason it's fun for the cat, is because they don't understand that it's not a meaningful object to chase around-- it just hijacks their attention when really they'd be more interested in a mouse or a small bird. If they *could* know that it was all just bullshit, they'd be bored immediately.

This is what I mean by \"consciousness is a memory\". \n\n\nAhh okay, this is very interesting, I *think* I actually disagree but it's really tiny and kind of just semantic nit-picking which is ... I fear, what conversations on this specific subject tend to be full of. Our language game really *sucks*, frankly, when trying to speak about consciousness.\n\nBut yeah let's just say memory is out of the picture completely and you're merely a Boltzmann brain type thing whose experience pops up as consciousness, and vanishes, never to be seen again. Purely a fleeting moment of the brightness of consciousness turning off, to whatever richness level, and then turning off just as fast.\n\nNo memory required, right? It's just a \"now\". That's what I think is fundamental to consciousness, the \"now-ness\". The fact that we feel a *persistent* now-ness is due to purely the happenstance of our brains having the ability to form and recall memories, but I don't think this means consciousness necessarily is a memory, or requires memory. \n\nAnd on that note, we often *don't* feel this persistent \"now-ness\", because we're so absorbed in some past idea or some future anticipation-- even right now, if I am mindful for just a second, I can recognize that I am completely absorbed in the anticipation of writing this post to you, to the point that I am largely ignorant of \"right now\"-- I'm just fleshing out the next word, the next sentence. I'm never *truly* \"present\", or aware of \"right now\". However, if I stop writing right now, and just sit-- close my eyes. Stop reacting. Just observe. *Then*, I will be present(if lucky). But when I'm writing to you, it feels impossible to not be constantly, subtly, anticipating the next move or action or thought.\n\n&gt; While it appears to exist in the \"now\", this is only an illusion as without the memories of prior representations as derived through the five senses, there can be no delineation between awareness\/consciousness and the IT (the ego-less experience of the five senses). \n\nHmmmmm, is this maybe a claim about the nature of time and our perception of it? And is this to say that consciousness is like *smearing* across the totality of experience, while subjectively, experiencing a hallucination or temporality, with concepts like \"now\" or \"before\"? In fewest terms, are we just trying to argue for some kind of extreme monism?\n\nAnyway, I think I've really simplified what we're trying to get at. It took days of thinking about this post while writing it, but I hope I've made sense of it: We're speaking about *conditions*. Senses are conditions. One can use the term \"sense of awareness\". There's awareness, and then there's \"no sense of awareness\", right? We can ask \"Awareness of *what*?\" but this is premature I think. This can be applied in the context of what you're calling the five senses, but it doesn't have to be.\n\n\n So for instance, one can see, and one can \"see *that* they see\" &lt;-- this is semantically bogged down, just to warn you in advance\/raise your awareness. There are numerous games to play here, and traps to fall into, in this phrase, that will just mislead or confuse us. The core question is, \"Is there a *distinction* between the natures of sense, and the natures of the sense of awareness?\" I think there's a *dramatic* difference. One can sense they see, but not see. One can sense that \"they do not see, but see\". \n\nThe first case would be an ignorance of the visual field while under the impression that one can see \"just fine\". A forgetting that there even *is* a visual field, despite it draping consciousness at every moment. If you ask someone under this condition: \"Can you see?\" They'll say: \"Of course.\" But they're clueless in a crucial sense towards whether they see-- they're reporting the fact of seeing, but they're just not that lucid\/aware. They're seeing, but they're blind in some crucial way, due to a deficit of awareness.\n\n\n\n The second case would be like in the case of closing ones eyes. One can think \"There's nothing here\" as a result of failing to pay close attention. You can trigger this right now by just closing your eyes and noticing that it's not pure darkness-- there are all kinds of visual distortions and slight nuances in vision-- a visual field is **still here**, but we can be confused about this fact. That really just characterizes in the small scale, what I'm saying is true in the large scale.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628444891,"distinguished":null,"edited":1628445136.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h86x8pu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oy0a82","locked":false,"name":"t1_h86x8pu","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h7x5k0w","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/oy0a82\/got_into_buddhism_but_the_pessimist_sentiment_of\/h86x8pu\/","retrieved_on":1652379672,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I'm not sure there's really any utility in it. Boredom doesn't necessarily teach us anything. It's a kind of neurosis, it's a harmful condition, it's a flaw. It's like saying \"Cuts are important, because then I can not climb up the barbed wire fence, or play with broken glass without any protection.\" One need not get cut to understand that the barbed wire is harmful, or that behaving frivolously around the sharp shards of glass is a bad move, or doing another activity is a better move.

It's a convenient ideology for the narcissist because they get to play pretend that the creator of literal time and space is magically in communication with them, and they then create a narrative where everything they do is supported by this God. Once they identify with this God, they develop a subconscious God-complex, and then everything that goes against this God, through whatever texts they prefer to cherrypick or whatever memes they prefer to parrot(if they're not the reading type, which they're often not), is some kind of \"unholy degeneracy\", so they're more able to egocentrically dominate those around them. You're bad, I'm good. Why? The book says so and it's perfect. But how do we even know the book is perfect? God wrote it, and he's perfect.\n\nEnd of discussion, right?

Everything and everyone is just being herded from one place to the next and you're expected to wake up every morning and not go \"What the fuck *is* this even?\". That condition causes a kind of neurosis, and can even get quite severe. There's value in examining it, but it can get pathological, right? So to get \"un-lost\", just recognize that everyone's in this boat together, and you have to start somewhere to get anything done. What do you value? That's a core question to ask. What do you value, and what *should* you value? How would you like to be treated here? How would you *not* like to be treated here? And really scrutinize these ideas for bias. Notice how far we've come even at this early stage, compared to the narcissist? The narcissist couldn't give less of a shit about any of this: \"Reality is as it appears to me, there's nothing to scrutinize, shut up, quit complaining, and do things my way.\" Sounds familiar?\n\nSo recognize that this is simply a long term problem to investigate-- doing that can create a sense of ease, and reduce the anxiety around *needing* to have a clue right here right now. That's a kind of arbitrary social standard and happenstance that comes about through the soup of evolution, where we have an adaptive benefit by being \"like the narcissist\", being confident, being sure that we know the way, being low in neuroticism despite the fucking mental reality that things exist at all and things are tortured in this plane of existence.

It seems naive, and it seems to pretend that politicians are either mostly benevolent or just bumbling morons-- but never these sinister, domination\/power-seeking organisms, who benefit from things like nepotism, dynasties of power and influence, propaganda, and other sinister elements. Because asking the question \"How do vaccine passports benefit politicians\" pretends as if we don't live in the sort of world where evil people with huge power and wealth socially engineer things for their benefit, to create a feedback loop of power and wealth. \n\nThis *includes* the engineering of pandemics for such purposes, by the way, and it's no accident that even suggesting such a thing is stigmatized. Whether or not the pandemic was engineered is sort of pointless, the virus could be naturally occurring through straightforward animal-&gt;human transmission, and the \"lab leak\" could be purely a distraction for... wait for it... political manipulation and social engineering!(Who knew that pitting the Western world against China could conceivably be strategically beneficial for some people?)

We can do things that aren't simply pleasurable or good for us in a straightforward way, but things that clearly lead to harm. There's a gradient here, since anything you can imagine that is pleasurable can lead to harm, but there's a clear distinction between something like a runner's high and the high someone who has a cutting\/self-harming condition feels. The brain really effortlessly hijacks the reward circuitry and can just so easily flip things that we should know are harmful into things we struggle to stop doing even to the point of completely being oblivious to their harm. \n\nJust notice the difference of clearly recognizing a thought like \"It's like I'm overeating to kill myself\" , which you wrote, and the *act* of doing so. In the act, it's not quite accurate to say you're totally lucid of the knowledge that a) You *are* pathologically over-eating(perhaps there's some recognition, but it's fuzzy, it comes and goes, etc), b) it's a bad thing to eat well beyond satiation-- it leads to harm and pain. This is why attention is the antidote to the things you're trying to capture, our brains that are easily oriented to crave, want, desire, seek, but not terribly oriented towards the attention that often has an immediate prophylactic effect-- it really can seem like a miracle cure. Just visualize this You're eating the 8th piece of cake. And suddenly, it just hits you. Mouth full of cake. You haven't swallowed the previous mouthful, and you've had another already. \"What the.... what the fuck am I *doing*?\" That's what attention just. The behavior just *ceases*, the moment clarity arrives. And it's only through a further *losing* of attention that the behavior can persist. Imagine what going *back* to the binging even means, subjectively? It literally just means *forgetting* what you just realized moments ago, while in the present. To remember it\/realize it again, is to immediately stop\/call into serious question the behavior again.

Learning something well can only be improved by having more and more clarity and mental acuity, no? Think back to a time you failed to learn something-- there's a real attention component, and that could even be a failure to recognize something like \"I find this subject is *torture* for me\"(the difference between mindlessly nodding to that idea versus having that idea explode in the mind with the clarity of a perfectly polished mirror, is the difference between dropping the subject or torturing yourself). \n\nIt's really hard for me to come up with a scenario where more attention isn't going to be largely beneficial-- and if I do come up with such a scenario, that scenario never survives the scrutiny of: \"Well... what if we just pay *even better* attention in this scenario?\"\n\n&gt; Then...if I'm conscious of my actions in that moment, and I fully believe those actions are harmful to me, then why do I choose to keep on eating?\n\nWell, that's the question to investigate, right? You can be conscious at the time of you performing those actions, but would you say you're *perfectly* lucid at every moment? Clearly no, right? Lucidity may pepper your experience, again-- recall the \"Oh *shit*, I left my keys\" type of clarity, and then imagine this clarity waning to the next thought that distracts you: \"Oh my god, that puppy looks like the puppy *I* had when I was 9! It's literally a carbon copy of her! It even has the same spot on it's left ear!\" \n\nIt's that second kind of subjective experience, roughly speaking, that makes it possible for you to continue eating beyond satiation, and that first kind of experience that makes it possible to stop(permitting it *persists*, which is rare\/difficult, due to the \"default\" being mindlessness-- conscious and mindful are two very separate conditions, the semantics are delicate: we're always conscious, but not always mindful).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628461322,"distinguished":null,"edited":1628461798.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h87wg5p","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p0il9c","locked":false,"name":"t1_h87wg5p","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h87vnfp","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/p0il9c\/has_anyone_been_able_to_get_off_the_hedonic\/h87wg5p\/","retrieved_on":1652377604,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

What I mean there is it's just like someone telling you that in order to do a deadlift, it's just a metal bar, with two or more plates that serve as weights, and then you pick it up with good posture, and put it back down. Easy to describe and say, but it's hard to 5x5 deadlift every other day or two while eating a caloric surplus, while gradually increasing the weight to reach maximum repetition for 10 years. But if you manage to do this simple but not easy thing diligently, then the benefits are just... crazy, no? It's something like that.\n\nThe method is: Sit down. Close your eyes. Relax by breathing in deeply, slowly, naturally, and exhaling the same way, a few times until you notice something has changed to the prior state of relative non-relaxation. Just notice this change first, it may be subtle, it may be dramatic, that's all okay. Next notice yourself sitting down, and all the associated pressure of being pressed against whatever you're sitting on, the sensations in your back, upper legs, the soles maybe if you're in a chair. Notice this difference too, of *knowing* you are sitting, and just contrast it with the prior condition of being fairly unaware of sitting. From here, the main exercise is just paying attention. In the same way we get stronger by using our strength, we get mindful by just *applying* attention to something simple, like the feeling of breathing in, and out. That's all you're doing. Notice the feeling of air going into your mouth or nose, and try to very calmly just increase how precisely attention is applied. *Unlikely* lifting weights, you are not summoning some huge effort to do this, you don't need to strain yourself. This is done more effectively, the *more* relaxed you are. \n\nWhat will happen is, you'll forget the entire point of all of this. This is okay, and totally normal. Just like the weight feels heavy, and we need to put it down and are unable to lift it beyond a point, it's not a sign of your weakness, but a normal process of progress and increasing strength. The same is true when you will fail over and over to pay attention. When you recognize that you've been completely side-lined by thoughts that just entered your mind like hostage-taking terrorists, captivating your attention, the process from here remains simple:\n\n Observe the thought as an object in consciousness, notice what happens when it is observed, and just return to watching the breath at a natural pace. If you feel particularly frustrated or overwhelmed, then just calmly start over. It's extremely beneficial to return to the step of \"know you're sitting\", and *really* know-- with a little bit extra precision than normal. Just a tiny bit is great, and should be recognized as positive. It's impossible to do this \"wrongly\" really, so even if you're just frustrated or uncomfortable or self-critical the whole time, just notice that too. Everything is a potential target of attention. **Everything**-- there's no right or wrong experience here, whatever is available in experience can in principle be noticed.\n\nTo start, I'd recommend doing 10 minutes of this a day for about 3 months. If this sounds scary or annoying or boring or some other aversive state, just appreciate how much time we waste on *random*, pointless misery or distraction on a daily basis-- surely it's worth it to at least try to sacrifice this time if for no other reason than to just free up time spent doing nothing other than suffering pointlessly, right? That'll be the silver lining if this turns out to be a failure. It should do the trick enough to make one go \"Okay... this... isn't bullshit. There's really something here, and it's a big deal.\" \n\nOh, and by the way-- if you *don't* want to do this, if I were in your position, I would simply tell myself that's fine too. You shouldn't do it in fact if it feels strongly aversive to you. You should keep this idea on the backburner instead, and just consider seriously doing it if you actually want to. It's not for everyone, and some people just won't benefit and will end up torturing themselves. Not everyone *has* to practice meditation, just like not everyone *has* to work out. But the ideas are so beneficial that it's helpful to at least be aware these options exist and can have great value.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628472974,"distinguished":null,"edited":1628498237.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h88jf2h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p0il9c","locked":false,"name":"t1_h88jf2h","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h87yxtc","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/p0il9c\/has_anyone_been_able_to_get_off_the_hedonic\/h88jf2h\/","retrieved_on":1652376269,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

The crucial dystopian element to me seems to be vaccine passports.\n\n\n&gt; Dont tell me its a slippery slope to gestapo policies for all eternity, because that's ridiculous.\n\nIt... literally is, though. That's how it's done. The law literally functions this way, too. You make a precedent once, and then as a lawyer, you refer back to this precedent and say, \"In this instance, this turned out to be legal, therefore this *similar thing* , should also be treated the same way\"\n\nNow, I'm personally a cynic, and criticize the generic libertarian attitude out there that seems to think we have *liberties* right now. I'd call them all superficial, and we're really just enslaved farm animals at this very moment living in a fictional narrative that involves the assumption and apparency of freedoms, which are instantly taken away by those who truly and meaningfully wield power over us if we'd ever pose a serious threat or the time comes where we're sufficiently inconvenient. I would also criticize the right-wing fantasy surrounding the 2nd amendment, that somehow is a \"failsafe\" to protecting said fictional freedom. Sheer coping in a dystopian world-- we are ants with sticks.\n\nThis is the sort of cynicism and pessimism someone like George Carlin would talk about when he says, crudely quoting, \"It's a big club-- and we ain't in it\". You and I and every other citizen of the world is in a slave-master orientation without it being plainly official, because this is a non-zero sum, unspoken social contract between slave and master, where neither benefit from a world where the power dynamic is overt. Due to this win-win scenario, it's covert, it's in the back of the mind, it's unspoken-- but it's there. The master doesn't have to expose themselves as an overt sinister tyrant and dystopian engineer(they are, however-- they need to be to reach this level), which is a 'win', and the slave doesn't need to drown in anxiety and dread on a daily basis knowing that they are crushed under the sheer gravitational force of a superhuman demi-god-- a 'win' the victims will gladly take over the alternative. Talking and thinking about it is taboo for everyone involved.\n\nThe former may sound hyperbolic, but it's really not a terrible exaggeration to use this language to describe the weight of 8 billion humans situated in a dominance hierarchy that has been distilling and perfecting for thousands of years in divergent genetics, immense socio-economic disparity, immense technological disparity, secrecy, and similar crucial variables. The moment you're a serious threat(you and I aren't, we're simply ants relative to a human homeowner-- even less than that, because ants are often a nuisance, and our insignificance is far more meaningful), you will be silenced or destroyed in this world.

How odd. The bottom of the pyramid is always clueless relative to the top, who enjoys secret knowledge, dynastic, nepotic, financial, and other benefits of sheer power. The Roman Empire built their aqueducts out of lead. This is in the context of many thousands of years of metallurgy--melting down ore, to shape into various objects, where the most clever humans easily had enough time to figure out something like: \"Well if grok drank from that really heavy cup, and grok has turned stupid while working around the really heavy stuff, then... the heavy stuff makes you stupid! It turns out that... anyone exposed to the heavy stuff... gets... dumber!\" Effortless for the sophistication of the Roman Empire. And yet even Roman built water pipes in modern Israel today, are made of lead, just to give you an idea of the sheer scale of dominance. These are the people who would later [execute you through torture](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Giordano_Bruno#Imprisonment,_trial_and_execution,_1593%E2%80%931600) for anything that even remotely stood as an alternative idea to their cultural dogma.\n\nIt's not a mystery what's going on. Our relationship to those who rule the planet, are closer to [these animals](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg) and the humans who torture them, rather than equal tribe members sitting around a fire in kinship. People of every political orientation get to enjoy the fantasy that they have *some* tribe out there, fighting for them, but this is pure fantasy-- it's just a power hierarchy here on Earth-- it's just a pyramid. George W. Bush and Donald Trump would eat your fucking liver on a deserted island in a *heartbeat* even if you're the most Republicany Republican out there if it suited them. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would throw you into the fucking brazen bull and cackle hysterically as you slowly roasted alive, and it wouldn't matter even slightly if you were a transgender Latina Indigenous person of color who lived their entire lives in poverty, if it just meant she got to be Queen of Earth. The narrative in both cases would likely be that you're a sacrifice, because that's what the ego does, it obscures it's sheer evil with a lack of self-awareness, and a self-deceptive narrative, and these people have egos the size of the biggest celestial objects we know of. \n\nThat's the hardest pill for everyone who is all-in on political tribalism to swallow. The rulers are not your friends, and the game is they divide you, and then they win. Even their *rivals* win(remember, non-zero sum where it can occur) because they're fundamentally dominating **you**, the person on the **bottom** of the pyramid-- and the depraved beauty of it all?: They don't need to conspire a single fucking time-- this all just happens as a naturally occurring phenomenon, like with the lions.\n\n\\*(You know, like \"Divide and conquer\"?

The actual power is going to rest in the hands of the psychopaths, and that's due to the state of our universe, where it's easier to light something on fire than to put it out\/undo the damage caused, where it's easier to spread a malicious rumor or smear someone's reputation than to repair that damage, and so on. The strategies which the psychopaths employ are generally benefitted by entropy, and the values of the \"good people\" out there, fighting for genuine justice, or benevolence, or progress, etc, are not benefitted by entropy. This is like having two video game characters, where if we assume equal skill of the players, one character deeply benefits from the \"stage\", and has a real strategy advantage. Over time, one character will clearly be overpowered.\n\nThen there's the traits of the psychopath that are objectively superior to winning such games, they are quite literally domination machines-- they are callous, egocentric, deceptive, manipulative, fearless, charming, and so on. Someone who is good, benevolent, etc, and has skin in the game of ethics, is at a severe disadvantage-- they are constrained by ethics, where the psychopath isn't-- a psychopath can perform the \"moves\" of good, effortlessly, because there's a strategic advantage for [camouflaging](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) oneself as good, but there is no such advantage in reverse(good *appearing* evil). This is why a philantropist billionaire could very well enrich the lives of thousands of children through lots of money thrown into projects for lifting them out of poverty, alleviating a mountain of suffering, while simultaneously, raping children and\/or sacrificing them to a fictional deity in a dungeon beneath their mansion-- this is compatible behavior for evil(I'm not endorsing any conspiracy theories, this is merely an example to demonstrate the nature of what we call \"evil\"). \n\nGood cannot do this, is is limited, constrained-- it can't be evil by definition, and this is true regardless of your \"ethical system\", you could be a religious de-ontologist, you could be concerned with consequences, or you could be concerned with virtue, whatever. Good literally has \"less moves\" in the game theoretical sense, and loses, given large time scales, and all else being equal. Again this is like the former video game analogy where not only does the stage in the game offer strategic advantages to one player, but one player is using an overpowered character compared to the other player. This makes it so any \"goodness\" that inhabits niches in the power structure is purely for show, as a non-zero sum arrangement that good falls for because not \"fighting the good fight\" would more expose the fact that we live in a hellworld that *must* be, via the laws of physics(the second law of thermodynamics), game theory(bad incentives orient people towards bad behavior, which they then \"win with\", since it is skilled cheating that wins any game state that has no referee, such as our world.

There's really nothing to say here except hope that there's room to appreciate that the brains of animals like ourselves can be deeply buggy. I would say that the fact that you can even ask the question, \"How does something like this even *happen*?\" is a silver lining here.

I know that to some degree you're asking rhetorically when you say \"How the fuck do you get over something like this???\" but it's not only rhetorical-- there's a matter here to investigate, to be curious of, to be inquisitive of.

That tells the story of how humans can be oriented towards evil attitudes(even to their own children, which makes no sense at all at first, but when you have a psychosis around what illnesses are and aren't, and to be clear, there's nothing to be \"cured\" in your case, and you have disposition to abuse your child, you can conceivably form the sorts of insane beliefs that your parent formed, and even act on them).\n\n Just notice that if you can manage(some people can't and there's never any shame in this, it's purely a matter of if it's something you feel comfortable affording) to keep being inquisitive and curious and even bewildered, those states of mind and dispositions are a deeply healthy thing, and it's not an accident that these things are very far from the state of mind of the person who abused you, who is by definition, not healthy. That alone is a kind of \"starting answer\". Part of trauma I think is tied to the *not knowing*, and just taking interest in the exact mechanics of the abuse can give one a sense of relief, so I do hope you stay curious-- you've already got it, which is again, amazing that it hasn't been robbed from you.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628490177,"distinguished":null,"edited":1628527311.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h89avce","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p0jneo","locked":false,"name":"t1_h89avce","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p0jneo","permalink":"\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/p0jneo\/i_still_cant_believe_my_mother_wanted_to_have_a\/h89avce\/","retrieved_on":1652374662,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Experiences like [Sylvia Likens'](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo), or [Gabriel Fernandez](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez), or Elisabeth Fritzl, or Junko Furuta, and several others, are just some examples of the hellish lives that really were lived(for lack of a better word) in our world. The interesting thing to note here is what this *says* about our world-- because the counterargument is always the same here:\n\n\"But there are good lives here too.\"\n\nYes, this is *true*, and it's actually easy to overlook this truth. This distinguishes our world from another world which seems to really exist, if something like the Many Worlds interpretation of Quantum Mechanics is true, because it at minimum says our world is not the *worst* hell that the laws of physics allow for. But the fact of the matter is it *contains*, or is *adjacent* to, many such \"worst hells\", even in the absence of many worlds the form of single subjectivities like those mentioned, or in the large scale and in the presence of MW, as literally existing realities that we cannot access but have reason to assume exist.\n\nThere's an interaction between hellishness and heavenliness, and goodness and wickedness, which is not intuitive. Many people seem to have a kind of natural intuition, that good and evil, heaven and hell, are two neatly equivalent forces. They imagine some sort of yin-yang, or some kind of fantasy scenario where the \"good guy\" is shooting some blue or otherwise benevolently-associated beam of energy, and the \"bad guy\" is shooting some red or otherwise malevolently-associated beam, and these two energies are just cancelling each other out perpetually. (Or, in this specific fantasy trope, the good energy, through sheer force of will or magic or miracle, finally.... after.... great struggle... wins!)\n\nIt's not an accident that this appears in fiction, but doesn't seem to appear in our actual world. Our actual world is quite the opposite, evil just dominates good and wears its corpse as its new skin, to frame it in a sentence.\n\nSo evil and hellishness, make a kind of mockery out of goodness and heavenly elements, in a way that goodness and heavenliness, do not seem to absolve or make up for, evil\/hellishness. It's one sided, in other words-- contra to the intuition and the fantasy trope. This doesn't say that heavenly lives aren't real, or aren't meaningful-- these things are priceless when they appear in hellish worlds. It's just that it doesn't make things *okay*. Even the short story \"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas\", the world there is framed as an ethical horror-- and that's just **one** child. Omelas is a fucking *paradise* compared to our world on Earth, where countless trillions of beings have been tortured for eons, and even that seems to make us revolt in disgust or at minimum \"walk away\" from. The point of this is to articulate the nature of badness in the light of goodness. Badness is such a *stain* to beings like us, that we won't even tolerate a single 'speck'. It's unclear if this is fundamentally how things are, of if this is a hallucination of human subjectivity that has some sort of escape velocity to it that we only need reach, but we should clearly *sprint* towards Omelas from our current position regardless of what is true, given that we're in an overt hellworld by comparison.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628493322,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h89emmi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oytcwy","locked":false,"name":"t1_h89emmi","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_oytcwy","permalink":"\/r\/areweinhell\/comments\/oytcwy\/hell_the_sandbox_for_all_things_that_can_exist\/h89emmi\/","retrieved_on":1652374449,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"areweinhell","subreddit_id":"t5_yzbmg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/areweinhell","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

A lot of these are answered by a single idea(sorry if it's too philosophical): If we don't make ourselves, but rather, we're just *thrown* here, into existence, like everyone is, then what does it *really* mean to say something is \"one's fault\"? We don't manufacture any single variable that makes us who we are, if you just consider it. We don't pick our genes, our parents, what location on the planet we were born into, which peer groups we stumble into, and therefore, we do not pick our social class, and we don't pick our neurons and therefore we don't pick our thoughts themselves.

Two, and this is the hard part, and falls into that previous category of \"there's no shame in not being able\/ready\/comfortable to do this\", it actually has the potential to make much of the trauma wash away, because this means the narcissist is more like a dangerous wild animal. If you think about it, it's no different from a bear, who mauls someone in the wilderness. \n\nThat's just what bears and other dangerous wild animals *do*. If they *didn't* have the brain of a bear, then you could maybe have a conversation with them. You could say, \"Hello, nice to meet you. I notice you're a person who speaks English. Hope you're doing okay, I'll go my way and respect your boundaries, and I hope you'll do the same.\" But that can't be done here, because this is an aggressive bear. We wouldn't... *hate* the bear, if it mauled us and ruined our lives, right?

His point was that if you're inclined to ignore the expected suffering of some act that has a very small probability of a large harm, to avoid a Pascal's wager, say, MWI says you should actually think (insofar as your uncertainty is over different physically possible worlds) your act *definitely* causes a large harm in a small measure of worlds.\n\nOh I know he wasn't advocating that, I'm just surprised that he would stretch that far towards idealism without realizing the potential price we pay(sort of like the most extreme Jainism sometimes being *ineffective* altruism in its excessive concern for relatively small scale ethical scenarios-- this is *distinct* I think from doing ethical philosophy on say, insect suffering, where the scope is quite large and meaningful).\n\n I consider myself biased towards idealism over pragmatism, and even in something like EV which you mention, I would advocate for intuitive or informal EV use rather than something formal, or derived through an AI\/machine learning, or a rigid systematization scheme, etc., if we *were* to endorse something here. I reject some of the other areas that I think fall into that trap, like ethics in general, which tries to systematize and categorize things to what I'd call a pathological degree, where we now think in terms of \"meta-ethics\" which we then hash out the implications of, leading to absurd scenarios and various repugnant conclusions(this is because our ethical approaches are fundamentally confused due to said pathological systematization) versus simply speaking of \"ethics\" in the way we speak of \"mathematics\"-- they are ontologically and epistemologically identical despite most of academia acting as if this can't be the case. We don't need to \"prescribe\" mathematics, or the values of math-- we just *do* math. Ethics can be spoken of in the same way, but ideas like Hume's have poisoned our thinking in this most crucial of fields.\n\nBut anyway, it just seems like we're in over our heads when we reach Many Worlds and ethical decision making-- to me it's clear we should solve ethical problems on our tiny rock *first*, and then I'm confident that it'll get easier to do physics and ethics, and we can tackle problems like Many Worlds ethical decision making, *if* such  a thing is meaningful.

Whether one is drawn to the cluster of ideas adjacent to each other that say things like \"Vaccines are bad\", \"Big Parma(the place the vaccines come from) is bad\", \"Covid is engineered with malicious intent\", and so on, versus idea clusters like \"Vaccines are good and reliable and trustworthy\", \"The places that make them are good, and to be trusted\", \"Covid is simply a disease like any other, that humans suffer from\"\n\nThese are not mutually exclusive ideas, and these examples don't exhaust the representations here, and there's a breadth of nuance here that gives rise to a richness of representations of reality(for example, one can *generally* support vaccines, but believe there's something wrong or unsafe or badly motivated with the Covid vaccines, or one or more of them, since there are several). But the fact of the matter is no matter what one believes, these beliefs are constructions as a result of the way one is, one's personality traits, which also determine one's political orientations, etc. It is identical to being very likely a Hindu, if born in Karnataka India, and very *unlikey* to be a Hindu, if born in Alaska, USA. Some of us may understand this arbitrariness when it comes to religion, but fail to see that really everything about the world we think is important, our representations of reality, like the events and happenings and topics of the world(like pandemics, vaccines) follow this exact same arbitrary modeling. It isn't(and is, in some ultimate sense) an accident that if one is a Christian, they're probably conservative, and have conservative politics. Or if one is a liberal, they are probably in that second cluster of vaccine\/Covid attitudes. There are outliers here of course because reality isn't that neat and ordered, but patterns do emerge. I consider myself generally sympathetic to liberal politics, but modern liberal politics as a cultural phenomenon I'm pretty averse to(due to be averse to tribal behavior, which is uniquely a problem for modern liberalism). I'm also very averse to conservative politics by nature of being born in a very liberal part of the world, and being turbulently indoctrinated into religion as a child, along with the uncomfortable road out of those beliefs. When this is the case, one is usually pigeon-holed into some kind of \"enlightened centrism\" fringe, where beliefs about vaccines and Covid probably run the gamut.\n\nI basically worry more about *worrying* about Covid, than about worrying about Covid. I'll wear a mask and that's as much thought as I want to put into the phenomenon, ideally, because my philosophical disposition leads me to being cynical and pessimistic about those who rule and engineer the planet and an event like this. Again, if you forgot, [this](https:\/\/outline.com\/cVLHwY) is the world we live in. It's not necessarily insane to expect deeply opportunistic(to the point of being malevolent) things out of power structures. The fact that it is stigmatized as insane(Even asking: \"Could covid be a hoax?\" \"Could Covid be engineered to control populations somehow?\" puts your sanity into question in the status quo), when all the evidence of the way the world works says this is far from insane(although not *necessarily* true), says something. If we lived in a deeply sane world, then perhaps asking these questions would rightfully exclude someone from a serious conversation, but the problem is we do not live in a sane world.

There's a psychopathic gradient to our species, and benevolent aliens would just call the entire species broken-- self-absorbed, delusional, callous, lacking empathy, lacking ethical wisdom, deceptive(self-deceptive), manipulative, scheming, oriented towards signalling(charm), this is not [Ted Bundy](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cmp43eP.png) I'm describing at this moment but rather the average member of the species. Someone like Ted Bundy is to me a kind of B or C grade psychopath-- the profound cases of psychopathy exist at the top of the global dominance pyramid on Earth, which by nature must be [camouflaged](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) in a way that's more meaningful than the mere charm of serial killers like Bundy.

It feels like a black hole to me, with it's sheer gravitational mass. Except this black hole has a collective consciousness, and it is predatory rather than mindless. All predatory dominance is a *kind* of [gravity](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=192) in its existence, and that's the nature of power, and powerful civilizations that are \"too large to fail\".\n\nClearly in my language, I think some real room for moral certainty(insofar as we can be certain of anything logically coherent) is there.

The iterated prisoner's dilemma is one such idea. \n\nI think my representation of the world, that evil fundamentally wins due to game theory, has a few problems. It's unsexy, it's depressing, we're biased against it fundamentally due to negative conditions of the world being maladaptive(simply -- if this is hell, being in touch with the fact it *that* it is, or *how* it is, will not be beneficial for survival and delusions around this will be more successful than an orientation towards reality), and so on. But most importantly, if evil wins, we'd expect a set of memes in our culture, and this includes academia, that would mask or camouflage or self-deceive away from the doomed nature of our condition.\n\nIt's uncommon to find game theory that supports my ideas, but you can find it on the fringes.

If the machine can decode your brain activity and extract words directly from your thoughts, then it could be possible for a machine to inject words directly into your brain against your will. If the machine knows your pathways, and it can impart energy onto those pathways, then it can force them to ignite, causing a ‘thought’, against your will.\n\n&gt;What does this have to do with a ‘simulation’?\n\n&gt;If it is possible for a cybernetics technology to be able to ‘read’ and ‘write’ from and to a brain, then that opens the possibility for a bad actor to provide un-natural inputs against the will of the person. This would mean that to an unknowing target, one’s own’s thoughts, a space for all of time consider a sacred and untouched place, could contain fraudulent information. This fraudulent information would be intermixed and indistinguishable from the person’s natural thoughts; a thought is just a thought it is assumed it came from you.\n\nThis seems like a profound source of potential anxiety at first, but really this has been the nature of being implicated in a causal soup of domination machines that impinge on each other in self-absorbed, egocentric, and therefore, malicious ways, for millennia now. This is true in the mechanics of beings in nature, like with parasitic domination(you can find countless sources of this; some popular ones are the [lancet fluke](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/059tdHM.png) which parasitizes several animals in its life cycle but ends up manipulating the nervous system of ants, which it hijacks to leave its colony, climb up a blade of grass, and latch on to the tip until its eaten by something like a cow to complete its goal. Another one is the fungi cordyceps which also manipulate ants, cause them to climb up onto the underside of a leaf, where they destroy the ant by erupting fruiting bodies from it, and then rain down their spores all over the ant's colony members to repeat the cycle). This is also true at \"our\" scale, the human scale, on the micro level with psychopaths, and on the macro level with social engineering regimes, propaganda, religions, cults, and so on. These are all tools and ways in which the \"will\" you refer to is hijacked against what the victim would desire if they could be free from manipulation or have informed consent.\n\nThis doesn't mean that the points you raise aren't important, but they are profoundly lacking novelty-- that is to say they are not in any way a \"new threat\". We live in the manipulative \"slave\/drone\" world one would already worry about, right at this moment, on a variety of different levels. These are metaphorical \"malevolent simulations\", despite no traditional computation being involved as far as we know.\n\n&gt; If it is assumed that our personality arises from our thoughts\n\nThis seems narrow to say given that personality is determined by a range of causes we're well aware of. Genes, we know can dramatically influence one's personality. Environment, parents, upbringing, geographic location, culture-- we know that there are personality differences based on these variables that are predictable and measurable. Thoughts and beliefs determine *behaviors*, certainly, and it could be said there's a feedback loop between thoughts and personality, ie, one could think: \"I should really stop being so selfish. I *don't* want to be an asshole.\" and this thought can impinge on one's personality in a way that produces real change. But generally speaking, the causality works the *other* way, if we're being precise. It's *personality* that determines ones thoughts. It's the way one **is**, that determines the way one thinks. If one *is* a psychopath, then this characterize the quality of their thoughts: \"I'm really enjoying seeing this person in pain before me. I really delight in making this person miserable. Feeling power over them is a thrill.\" and so on. Again, it's those prior causes that determine whether or not one is a psychopath: Genes, upbringing, parents, and so on. So this can be an important distinction on the mechanics of one's identity and their causes.\n\n&gt; I think that most of us hold the belief that our thoughts are an untouchable and intimate safe place where we construct our identities.\n\nThe fact that such a belief is popular could be true, although I'm not sure, but this is a delusional fantasy given what we know about the brain. There's no \"we construct our identity\", we're thrown into our identity and we helplessly express it. This is true for animals(A wolf is *simply* a wolf, it can *only* be a wolf-- by definition. Not just physically, but as a description of it's phenomenology and the behavior it gives rise to), and this is true for humans(Like the aforementioned psychopath, or an individual who has the willpower to say, train for a tough sport or fitness routine vs. an individual who simply lacks said willpower-- these are helplessly expressed and any \"Self-made\" feelings are purely illusory and go against everything we know about what causes people to be who they are). One can do what one wills, but one cannot *will* what one wills. This is sometimes confusing for people, and helps support the fictional idea of \"Free will\"*\n\n*(Which by the way, is a good example I would say of a malevolent propaganda meme that arises from religion, which serves to socially engineer and facilitate domination by bad actors. Without free will, the farce of \"justice\" in the form of punishing beings oriented to do what we call wrong would be exposed, and the genuine injustice of kings and royals and wealthy aristocrats, when these are simply arbitrary happenings that aren't 'deserved' any more than the impoverished quadriplegic deserves the experience they were thrown into, is obscured by this pernicious lie of \"free will\"-- This is the only meme which allows for us to tolerate this injustice, while serving as a foundation of \"hating\" or \"resenting\" or \"wishing revenge or spite\" or the egocentric feeling of \"pride\", and so on.)","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628565761,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8dajv4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p15x6q","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8dajv4","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p15x6q","permalink":"\/r\/AWLIAS\/comments\/p15x6q\/simulation_theory_is_underhanded_but_true\/h8dajv4\/","retrieved_on":1652366273,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AWLIAS","subreddit_id":"t5_2vmwn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AWLIAS","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

The sort of exploitation I'm speaking about isn't the non-zero sum sense where everyone benefits, the sort I'm speaking about, and the article is speaking about, is exploitation that has zero-sum outcomes. In less abstract terms, what that looks like, just to get a vivid picture in your mind:\n\nYou're in a village. Your neighbor is evil, but you're not. You don't know your neighbor is evil. There's a potential for both of you to cooperate, and both win. And this is what you'll helplessly do, since being evil seems like a shitty strategy to you-- you can *intuit* you'll win if you're evil, that part isn't beyond your understanding, but the \"winning\" here seems superficial to you-- it's not satisfying. The meaningful win for you here is where everyone around you wins. You recognize that if your neighbors can only recognize this too, you'll all win in a very profound way-- a way that is *way* better than if one person just fucks everyone over. Okay?\n\nNow, your neighbor can't intuit this at all, by the nature of what they are. They're what we'd call a psychopath. They not only can't see what you see, they can't value the things you do, but they're actually oriented to cause you harm. Not just cause you harm, but actually *gain* from your harm-- it satisfies them in and of itself. They're quite ambitious in winning this dominance game over you. So they burn your house down. Now whatever economic games you've been competing over? You're fucked, because you have to repair your house. The physics here harms you far more than your neighbor, because your neighbor actually benefits from the entropic nature of burning down someone's house, given that just the happenstance of the physics make it easy to strike a match and walk away-- versus the immense project of repairing after a fire, or rebuilding. If we existed on a negentropic gradient where things naturally moved towards order, this advantage for them would not exist. But they're actually at an advantage, given entropy.\n\nThey can do this memetically too. They can spread a rumor in the village that goes, \"You know... \/u\/Funksloyd is probably a pedophile. I saw him leering at my very young daughter, and he even seemed to want to touch her inappropriately.\" This could be *simply* a total fabrication, but it doesn't matter here. Once the lie takes hold, you can't actually undo the damage. They've *exploited* the nature of the game theory here by the very fact of how malicious strategies win, and benevolent strategies lose. You could be a great guy. You could truly live out your best intentioned nature here-- if we could look inside your brain, we'd see a person who deeply wishes to do good and win-win and forgive and forget. **None of this matters**, because you're just **fucked** by this person who is oriented to cheat, and win via exploitation.\n\nSo if you just take this idea, and extrapolate it on the huge scale, huge scope, account for thousands of years of history. Account for the [malevolent nature of certain memes](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moloch) and how they seem to *feed* into this \"cheating wins\" game state by not just engineering psychopathy, but also crippling the good, since the good are going to be the victims, not these powerful, advantaged, cheating psychopaths. These people then not just *gain* power, but they *keep* power [through cheating](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brazen_bull). What happens is psychopathy only distills because of further functions of natural selection. The more evil one is, the more selection pressure will [camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) evil, up until a point where we can't even *make sense* of a word like \"evil\". We'd have an atmosphere where no one really knows what one is talking about when one says \"evil\"-- the fact that this is our *current* atmosphere at the heights of modern academia is not an accident.\n\nSo again, I don't think this is a matter of glass half full\/half empty. There really is a fact of the matter here-- either evil wins and gains more and more power, or not. The evidence seems to suggest it does exactly this. There's no *real*\" silver lining. The \"silver lining\" or non-zero sum element you're thinking of is something like... [the animals here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg) whose genetics \"benefit\" from being maintained, but it's not meaningful, because the genes are too stupid to understand the host of the genes is just being raped and tortured by the most malevolent beings the environment knows of.

Turns out that was bullshit too.\n\nWhat else...\n\n\nOh, the modern version. The modern version is truly fucking evil genius, because they are exploiting the fact that we really seemingly polluted the Earth to environmentally destabilizing levels, so you constantly get this fear-mongering that seems distinct from the prior apocalyptic bullshit, which was almost exclusively religious in nature because people were just that stupid and easy to manipulate prior to the internet. So it's actually our own frivolous and exploitative behavior( which really is true), that is going to cause the next apocalypse, which will, due to some geopolitical complexity, cause all of civilization to break down.\n\nI'm sure this time it's not propagandistic social engineering despite the genuine science pointing to global warming being real. :)","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628576641,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8dr4qr","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p1cnjm","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8dr4qr","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h8cjskr","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/p1cnjm\/deleted_by_user\/h8dr4qr\/","retrieved_on":1652365318,"score":12,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

This doesn't argue *against* my point, but rather validates it further: Selfishness is the core problem, and a requisite of not being selfish is considering what would happen to other human beings who are living relatively stable lives, if society truly and utterly broke down, and admitting something like \"My apocalyptic fantasy doesn't matter, because I know others would be truly harmed if this really happened\".\n\n&gt; Who is the bigger asshole?

The feeling of total safety a woman felt late at night on the road when she noticed an unassuming, kind looking man with an arm in a sling, seemingly injured with car issues. \"Ugh... this is so sad, we have to help this poor man. One second.\"\n\nBundy wore his arm in a sling strategically to provoke this response. This is just the single interaction between one psychopath, and one of countless victims. This will appear on a macro level in a world dominated by psychopaths(all the evidence points to this being our world, when one is totally committed to honesty rather than what is pleasant to believe).\n\nProgress is therefore a kind of non-zero sum bone thrown to the bottoms of human hierarchies. We benefit from a world where the rulers on Earth are not overt evil tyrants who we can plainly see, this would induce terror and drop our productivity as exploitable and cooperative agents-- selection pressures would destabilize systems that operated on overt tyranny, and instead instantiated covert tyranny as a function of covert tyrants, or in other words, \"Apex psychopaths\". Whatever or whoever these beings are, also benefit from allowing a world where they seem like benevolent rulers. Win-win, but ... only superficially. The real winner is expressed through sheer dominance.\n\nThis is how you square the fact of the world being dominated by immense evil, with concepts like alleviating poverty, the strengthening of social safety nets, philanthropy, charity, ethical progress, and so on. Malevolence doesn't need to be the norm, by the way, since we're describing a pyramidal structure-- the true malevolence is at the tippy top point, on a gradient.

The higher up you go, the more you get really serious. More callousness. More domination drive. Serious ego. Serious manipulation\/deception. Serious *charm*.

It's like saying \"Magnus Carlsen is just a human\" when you're an 800 Elo player and you actually *have* to beat him. Such a person doesn't even understand the rules of the game at that level.\n\nOne could say, \"Okay but that analogy doesn't work here because human power struggles and chess are different in that one is a \"multiplayer game\" while chess is single player against single player.\" But whatever wins the game is by definition more evil than the thing currently winning, because you don't ever win a game where you're against a bad actor without being a bad actor, having certain traits. This is why psychopathy is so clearly associated with being a CEO or similar. From the notorious case of the well documented brutality and callous behavior of someone like Steve Jobs, to the self-aggrandizing(literally means \"Me powerful. Me important.\") behavior of Jeff Bezos, it's a special kind of \"domination machine\" we're speaking about. Here are some of the traits of psychopathy:\n\n* Callous (This isn't just \"I don't care\", this is \"I *can't* care-- it says something about who one *is* and who one *can* or *cannot* be. Without this, psychopathic behavior would largely be incoherent or be a solvable problem. The moment someone doesn't care and cannot care about something, whatever game you're playing simply ends. If someone doesn't care about logic, then you cannot use logic to convince them. If someone doesn't care about ethics, you cannot appeal to what is right and wrong. And so on. This is strategically useful for a psychopath because it goes hand in hand with the personality trait \"Low in agreeableness\", it's a kind of ultimate \"No\")\n\n* Self-absorbed (When the game is zero-sum, which means winners and losers, then it's clearly unwise to be selfless or altruistic in a meaningful way. This is distinct from feigning altruism, which is clearly useful as a strategy to camouflage what's actually going on-- which is the psychopath essentially saying \"My way, or the highway\".  This is true of violent thugs who beat their spouses, and this is true of billionaires who are comfortable buying a third yacht.)\n\n* Domineering (This is simply an orientation to control things and express power over the weak. It should be obvious how this not only helps someone like a serial killer **be** who they are, but also obviously helps the CEO of a company gain a monopoly over their economic niche)\n\n* Fearless(This will be a theme here, but when you're in hellworld because being evil is strategically advantageous, it turns out it's useful to have no fear of clearly negative consequences, both of being evil oneself, and of behaving in evil and therefore dangerous ways. Danger is a sign that says \"Don't do this\"-- this would have to necessarily be turned off or reduced for the psychopath to function efficiently)\n\n* Manipulative(This is an *orientation* to \"fuck with things\", simply put. This is the difference between the famous meme that gets repeated here about the fisherman who is content with life and one-ups the entrepreneur? The fisherman is not a manipulation machine-- the entrepreneur **is**, that's why they can't converge on things, they simply express their traits differently)\n\n* Deceptive(Who knew that lying, and especially lying to oneself by deluding oneself in false but useful, self-serving narratives could be useful for winning games where everyone around you is evil and cheating)\n\n* Sadomasochistic(This is important to distinguish from *merely* being sadistic, which is a motivation to cause others harm-- because disregarding one's own safety is important here. You can be sadistic and also be deeply concerned with your safety. This is inferior to being the suite of sadism+masochism in strategic terms, because you're not only motivated to throw punches, you laugh and are motivated when they throw a punch at **you**. It's like that trope where the villain gets hit by some kind of protagonist, sees blood drawn from one's face, smiles, wicks it off or maybe tastes it which serves even more entertainment, and then proceeds to beat the shit out of the opponent. Sadomasochism is crucial to win any kind of insane \"tit-for-tat\" game which involves \"cheating\")\n\n* Charming(this is a character trait that makes someone like you or not. This is a smile that reliably makes one go \"This guy *can't* be evil\". It's a kind of uncanny [camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) that has evolved over eons, because it's strategically useful for evil. True evil looks beautiful to us, not ugly, like all the movies and books and religions have said.)\n\nThese traits feed into each other, it's like an ecosystem. Deception is synergistic with manipulation, obviously. You're more domineering by definition if you're more self-absorbed-- being domineering is pretty much incoherent in a context of deep selflessness and low egocentrism. Consider someone at the peak of an LSD or psilocybin experience: there's no \"one\" there, there's no ego even there, to dominate anything. Such motivation is just impossible in this frame of mind. To have the trait \"low self-awareness\" is strategically useful for a psychopath(and therefore, for a CEO), because it goes hand in hand with something like \"fearlessness\", which is a narrow kind of lack of self-awareness. It's a specific lack of awareness of the truth that one *should* be afraid, if they were rational, but instead they're oriented towards winning games in a superficial sense-- a sense that is not meaningful. \n\nI'm calling sheer domination here superficial winning, which is just \"winning for the sake of winning\" like [predatory animals in nature](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall) \"win\". If these animals could be more enlightened, technologically advanced, more sentient, more oriented towards ethics, then they could stop for a second and go: \"Holy shit... this is a fucking nightmare scenario. I'm a fucking monster. I'm eating this thing, alive... what.... am I? What is this place? How would this look if the situation were reversed?\" &lt;-- this is impossible both for the Lion, but also very often for the psychopath and for the CEO. Just notice that-- they are all fundamentally the same thing-- a robot that is oriented to dominate its environment. What does it mean to dominate a thing which is best oriented to dominate?

Who one is?\n\nSo, sorry for the lack of brevity here, but this nuance is important to finally get to the point: To win versus *that* thing?

I kind of go back and forth around the idea of \"coping\". I think to say something is a \"cope\", is to call it not genuine, or a kind of escapism. So I have a kind of aversion to just the idea of being someone who is \"coping\". On one hand, I just want to know what's true. If being afraid is the appropriate response, I sometimes think I want that. I don't want to be fearless when fear is the only sane move. These emotions are just functions of traits, which are functions of genes x environment, which then get pretty randomly expressed as just more strategy, for more adapted genes. But you can ignore all of that, and just ask in terms that genes can't comprehend, terms that involve questions like:\n\n\"What is true?\" \"What is right, what is wrong?\"(Which leads to: \"Is right and wrong meaningful-- is there a fact of the matter to right and wrong? -- I think so) \"What is valuable?\"(Is there a fact of the matter to what should be valued? Again, I think so)\n\nGenes cannot possibly care about any of this-- it's just a mindless molecule that is oriented through physics and chemistry and certain rules around how organisms engage with each other. But I can try to make sense of it, and I think it's possible to succeed to make sense of it(obviously it's also possible to fail).\n\nSo with fear, it's possible to be fearful and simply be confused in one's fear-- you can just be worrying about something that doesn't exist, or misunderstand some other variables. It's also possible to be right to fear something. Fear can lead to an orientation to doing what's right, and lacking fear here, will be the contrary-- an orientation to doing what is wrong. That's because fear is related to worry, just conceptually. And worry is related to concern. And these are all related to values: \n\n\"What is *important*?\" \n\nJust intuitively and transparently, right? These words must make sense, and relate to each other, if words mean anything at all. Concern is not meaningfully related to \"Blue\". It's meaningfully related to worry, care, value, etc. Lacking *all* fear, therefore, is just strange, no? That means you don't even fear doing the worst thing possible, whatever that is. You don't fear being completely delusional. You don't fear being a monster. You don't fear being wrong. You need *some* fear\/concern\/worry, and that's because you need *value*, and value presupposes a concern towards losing what one values.\n\nYou're free to substitute \"worry about\" instead of \"fear\", or \"have concern\" or \"value the harm in\", etc. These are all related. Does this mean you should live in fear of losing what you value all the time? No, of course not, there is pathological fear, like we said. And there's even times where you'll feel fear for absolutely the right reasons. A sadist is breaking down your door, and they plan to torture you for the next few months until you die from pain, and you have no way of defending yourself or escaping. \n\nHere, it's technically a sign of sanity to feel fear, and fear can sometimes motivate you because this is how the human nervous system has dealt with situations like these historically, but there are certainly cases where fear could simply be too high of a price in psychological terms, and you'd be better off calmly collecting yourself and either looking for something you've missed to resolve this situation, or simply letting go in the face of the inevitable-- it's certainly worse to be floundering in crippling fear while a sadist tortures you, than to have the resolve of [this guy](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c) in the face of extreme pain.

It makes sense somewhat, being the poorest person in South Korea is pretty shit, like how living in poverty in the US or anywhere else sucks and the disparity between you and the well off takes an additional psychological toll. \n\nThis completely makes sense to me, and we can be forgetful in generally two common ways in our political pathologies. We can either pretend like the west is completely degenerate, and there's nothing good about living in a world like South Korea or New York or London and \"want the world to burn\" and salivate at the thought of societal collapse. Or we can forget that there really is a price to pay in living somewhere like North Korea-- that there really are more overt dystopian cults than not. It really is *shit* to live in North Korea, which is why virtually no one here would want to go there if you were offered a free, but permanent ride. You simply would have to shut up or be tortured, and even if you behaved, daily life would suck objectively more. That's the reality of North Korea.\n\nBut this doesn't mean that our world is better in every way-- we can speak freely here, but that's only due to the power dynamic being so exaggerated that we're even less powerful than ants attacking a homeowner, in the West. Ants are a meaningful threat sometimes, there are exterminations performed against them. No \"ant-like\" human, gets exterminated because they criticized the government or an intelligence agency or a corporation too much, generally, and contrary to the fantasy people tell themselves, that's not because:\n\n&gt; \"We're the West, we're advanced, we have enlightenment values, we're more civilized, we're more ethical\". \n\nIt's instead because immense, absurd power can afford such a thing. If a Russian citizen is a dire threat to the functioning of the KGB or the security of Russia, the KGB *will* simply neutralize this threat in any way necessary-- that's just what power means, and what power does. It's simply true that this is very hard to do, and that's not because liberties project this citizen, it's because words can't actually threaten power that is sufficiently powerful. The same is true in the US, or in China, or in India, and so on. There's a long history out there of essentially this very thing happening, and the fact that you can even see this history yourself is not ultimately an expression of progress, or ethical civilized societies, but an expression of power disparity.\n\nSo the trade off is: A Hellworld where most people are poor, and know they live in a Hellworld, and have to shut up and be miserable, vs. a Hellworld where most people are poor\n\n(I think the disparity is even greater in the West, due to Capitalism, no? Even though it's true that it's better to be poor in the West than poor in a place like North Korea-- only someone completely drunk on political ideology would dispute this),\n\n and the Hellish nature is significantly overt and shrouded in narratives around progress and civilization. There's still a fantasy Hellworld narrative in the West, the margin of which is the left-right political scheme, where both sides blame the values of the other side explaining the theory behind why the Hellworld is there. But the utility is that both sides generally believe progress is possible(it isn't, since life is purely about power and domination, and the only thing that wins that game is the most brutal, deceptive, cheating, unstoppable force-- something we can call \"Evil\").\n\nIn short, the game is not just rigged now, but will always be rigged, but there's still a tiny silver lining here because we can \"lose less\". Losing less means picking Capitalistic hell with all its flaws, and containing relatively covert slavery that includes a wage(although often a wage where one is more exploited than liberated) over Cult dystopian dictatorship hell, where the wage is so clearly unlivable that no one even bothers to make a point of it, not that they could, because they would just \"disappear\" to get tortured if such a thing ever crossed someone's mind.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628712041,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8kousp","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p29h5v","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8kousp","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h8jj0g6","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/p29h5v\/is_yeonmi_park_telling_the_truth\/h8kousp\/","retrieved_on":1651708448,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It seems more rational to just examine the situation in front of us for as long as one can.\n\n&gt; I think you're assuming most humans are very stupid and very easily manipulated.\n\nOf course, but why even call this an assumption? This is so obviously true if you just look out into the world and re-examine how effortlessly others are exploited at every level. Examine the psychological literature where we see nothing but scientists manipulating subjects in a lab setting to perform some behavior, then in the subject's reports, they invent some complex narrative about why they did that behavior when the scientists *fully* know the precise mechanics of how the behavior was reliably manipulated. That's how clueless and robotic we are.\n\n&gt; You're also assuming that reality is a zero-sum game, which I disagree on\n\nThis is also not really an \"assumption\", because that's where all the observation points towards. I've outlined where and why it's non-zero sum, is there some argument you have in response to it not being, in the ultimate sense, zero sum?\n\n&gt; but I'm not even going to try to press any of these arguments.\n\nOh...\n\n&gt; I, personally, do not believe the hierarchy is permanent. I think it is an artifact of evolution's failures and something we can destroy with time and effort. I also think humans are not bound to our evolutionary origins.\n\nOkay, I think not believing hierarchy being permanent is pretty compatible with what I'm saying. Clearly power shifts all the time. Clearly something stronger comes along. But there's absolutely no reason as far as I can see to think hierarchy can be solved, given that by **definition**, to \"solve\" it, means to play the game of hierarchy, because you're expressing power **over** the power hierarchy. \n\n&gt; Also, regarding one particular statement - what does it mean to dominate a thing which is best oriented to dominate?\n\n&gt; You don't. You fucking kill it and hang up its entrails as a warning. Or if you want to be more civilized, you lock it in the deepest, darkest hole you can find and throw the key into the ocean. We are all extremely capable of dehumanization, and we can absolutely use that against those psychopathic manipulators as a weapon. You can't talk your way around a bullet. You can't manipulate a million people who have collectively decided they no longer need you and that you are a threat to their survival. There is no necessary need to 'win' versus the enemy when you can just flip the board. In the end, humans are all physical things made of meat, and when their blatherings are ignored, they have no power.\n\nOkay, well I hate to break it to you but killing something and hanging up its entrails as a warning **is** by definition to dominate that thing. The same is true for locking it up. All you're describing here is the same behavior that's been operative for thousands and even hundreds of millions of years, in the broad sense. The winners are rewarded as domination machines, and then these winners are the prime candidates for reproduction. The losers are bred like cattle, and the threats are sterilized, exterminated, locked up, deprived, tortured, \"made an example of\", and so on. This is nothing new, this is just the standard formula of domination. You're not talking about flipping the board here, you're talking about just using the same old rules. What would flipping the board even look like? It would need to transcend an expression of power, while being powerful enough to not just beat the players but to invalidate the entire game of power: **by definition, this is power**.\n\nNotice how you can't escape the problem of power? You're free to play different games, of course. You can play the kindness game. You can play the truth game. But ultimately, the game that dominates those games, is the power game. Nothing beats the power game, because to beat it, once must by definition be playing it. And to be a skilled player in the power game one must possess evil traits, because these are the traits oriented for power, wealth, status, domination, all the evils we see in our world plainly and clearly.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628723013,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8lensq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p1a95e","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8lensq","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h8gjlw1","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/p1a95e\/what_do_you_think_about_this\/h8lensq\/","retrieved_on":1651706970,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I think this kind of hope is rational, because there are clearly better and worse ways for \"life to go\", regardless if winning is impossible, because there are still gradations of losing.\n\n&gt; What is a society where everyone is interested in each other's success as well as individual self-interest? [...] But, as far as I can tell, this is an argument between two people whose beliefs are at such fundamental odds between each other that there is no common ground to be found. I'm an optimist and you're a pessimist.\n\nIt's true, I'm oriented towards pessimism. I think that's a larger discussion, but briefly, we don't seem to be evolved to process reality. This is especially true if we exist in a kind of(NSFL) [hellworld](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PcnH_TOqi3I), which [the evidence](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo) strongly suggests if one [looks dilligently](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg). If our world reliably made evil win, via strategies of domination like eating things which have the potential for immense pain and psychological trauma alive, or torturing members of our species, or just dominating humans in socioeconomic or memetic\/propagandistic terms(religions, cults, political ideologies), then through evolution, sentient things would not emerge to properly see reality. It would harm your odds of survival to see the truth. This is what would be called \"maladaptive\". This explains why optimism bias is a genuine delusion, and now we should expect the same for pessimism, but it's not. Instead we have something like depressive realism, which is the idea that depressed or broadly taken, pessimistic people, see reality *more* accurately, rather than less. I doubt this idea matters too much because even if it were true, it wouldn't get off the ground due to how psychologically destabilizing the implications are once taken seriously.\n\n&gt; Humans clearly have morality. Else things would be even worse than they already are. \n\nAgreed, it's a good thing that humans are able to make sense of ethics. It's an uncommon view, but I think whatever is true morally is true regardless if anything exists, just like math is true(2+2=4) regardless if anything exists to understand it. And things certainly would be worse if everything was just morally nihilistic or morally anti-realistic to the core. Unfortunately, our academia is oriented to exactly that kind of approach-- it's implicit in the way ethics is fragmented and systematized in academia today. It's very difficult to academically simply say \"It's wrong to torture a child's feet with a blowtorch, as a matter of **fact**, in ethical terms\". You'd get that former moral anti-realism\/moral nihilism\/moral relativism of \"But how you can say that's *really* wrong?\" \n\nBasically, things are already poisoned towards psychopathic value systems, so while there is a silver lining, and benevolent moral acts in benevolent moral contexts *do* occur on Earth and that's clearly good, there's a very dark cloud eclipsing this silver lining. The trade-off for being ethical beings is shrouding psychopathy-- a psychopath is more effective if they can feign altruism. So we're basically instantiating the ultimate evil, which is covert, which hides in its ethical expression, while benefiting from a world which can never just admit \"It's *really* wrong, not just subjectively wrong, to torture an innocent being for frivolous reasons\".","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628728008,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8lpeil","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p1a95e","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8lpeil","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h8lj4zl","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/p1a95e\/what_do_you_think_about_this\/h8lpeil\/","retrieved_on":1651706228,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

He completely fell off the wagon but I stuck with it, and here I am years later. It was his idea even though I was dabbling with meditation very casually at the time.\n\nIt's strange how some of us seemingly need these sorts of tricks to get things done. I'm generally quite low in conscientiousness, but I can intuit things better than average I think, so I can just kind of self-talk my way through things like this like:\n\n\"Well, isn't this just a bullshit trick of the monkey brain, anyway? Why shouldn't I just pretend like I'm making an agreement to be disciplined with myself, or an imaginary friend, or someone in the multiverse who *would* make the agreement with me if they could).\" \n\nThis gets so seemingly tangible to me through intuition that it's as if it has already happened, even though it hasn't.\n\nYou can do that trick to overcome things like insecurities or mental blocks too. If you're ever worried that you're unskilled at something for example, you can just tell yourself that as long as you know you'll stick with improvement(surely you can force yourself to do anything reasonably within your skill if your life depended on it), and you know it's just a trivial and arbitrary amount of time which is purely a subjective illusion to reach a skilled position(the position you lack now, which is causing you insecurity or anxiety), so it's almost as if you're **already** at that level of mastery right now. It's just a matter of a-&gt;b-&gt;c, or just a trivial matter of waiting(a perspectival\/subjective illusion). This is not only true and supported by the physics and neuroscience around out intuitions of time, but it causes a change in perspective that can undo the mental block that's preventing you from just doing the thing you're worried about doing that you know is going to be good for you.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628740387,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8m4i69","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p1gt4j","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8m4i69","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h8g0xim","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/p1gt4j\/thoughts_on_therapy\/h8m4i69\/","retrieved_on":1651705373,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I think to get a real sense of something significant, all one needs is a few minutes per day for a few months, roughly speaking. And then if one can stick around for longer, things will only become more and more clear(could we expect the opposite? We're just training attention here. It's like being surprised that one has gotten stronger rather than weaker after spending a couple of months to a couple of years in the gym lifting heavy objects for a few days per week).\n\n&gt;  it is really just a mental state \n\nIt's a mental state, sure, and really there's no way to escape this as a subject, right? Everything is always going to be a mental state, ego loss or not, in *some* sense. Mental states are just fundamental to any kind of phenomenology. But there's a bit of *potential* dismissiveness, see if you can spot it because it can be very subtle sometimes. Like an implied \"It's *merely* a mental state\". Do you detect that at all? There are clear differences between the mental state of being precisely aware of thoughts and emotions, and the mental state of just being a schizophrenic or a severe neurotic and not even recognizing: \"I'm simply thinking at this moment\" &lt;-- very far from this awareness.\n\nSo there are mental states we really do want to move towards to, and states we want to move away from. Not \"want\" in the generally arbitrary, generally trivial sense, like, \"I *want* to move towards a state of opioid-induced euphoria because I'm a monkey seeking stimulus\", but \"want\" as in:\n\n\"We're objectively correct( as subjects ) to want to be in touch with reality and be free from truly pointless suffering that is utterly unnecessary and avoidable in a meaningful way, that does not cause us to \"cope\" or \"be delusional\" or \"think wishfully\" and so on\".\n\nThis is why it doesn't make sense to me to dismiss mental states *as such*, on the grounds that they are mental states.\n\n&gt; that is dependent upon very specific conditions: a very tightly-honed physiological state in a safe, undisturbed environment.\n\nThe idea that you need peace or silence to meditate, is actually a common confusion. It's certainly harder to train in total chaos, but one can meditate really anywhere, and in any circumstance. There's a meditation involved [in this scenario](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c#Day_of_the_act). In fact, without meditation in that precise moment, this scenario would be impossible to perform as it occurred. That's just the total extreme of course, and in most practical cases(of the extreme sense you're speaking about), there are simply objects of attention. So let us look at something less abstract:\n\nSuppose there's domestic verbal abuse and general chaos of some kind, like from a spouse or parent or family member. There's this common intuition that someone would try to meditate here, and then the chaos of their world would disturb them, making them unable to meditate. This is basically confused about what meditation *is*. It's just about recognizing objects in consciousness. One can meditate on extreme pain. One can meditate on noise. One can meditate on suffocating fumes, and so on. The only task is to recognize thought and emotion and sensation as such-- appearances in the mind.\n\nIt's not about peace, the effect of peace comes once one doesn't identify with the objects in awareness-- there's an inherent peace waiting in awareness(again, think back to the monk on fire-- he is actually feeling *peace* in this moment, believe it or not-- that's the phenomenology if we could look inside the brain). There's no such thing as a \"distraction\" in the context of meditation, because everything one could call a \"distraction\" is just another object in awareness. It's not about *stopping* thought by force, this is another misconception, but rather to *observe* thought which arises as thought, and not being one's thoughts\/emotions(to intuit this just imagine how stupefying an emotion like anger is-- you can't stop it, if you're just angry enough, right? You can't just snap out of it-- you're at the mercy of anger and you will be angry as long as this emotion captivates your mind. But the relationship is the other way around through meditation-- it's not anger captivating you, it's you captivating anger-- when this happens, anger just loses its character as something related to you, and often just vanishes quickly if observed). Notice what we're talking about is crucially different from \"coping\", which is a kind of ignorance or distraction, like the Opium we mentioned earlier, or \"Positive thinking\", or religious belief that God has a plan and loves you, etc. This is a matter of attention, a matter of knowing whatever there is to know, non-judgmentally. Pure awareness and nothing more.\n\nWe're getting really nitty gritty here but we have to-- just to clear up some ideas about the mental state we're trying to discuss, hopefully it doesn't sound too nuance-dense. I put too much on the table right now for one post, and your thoughts on technology are interesting and I'd like to address that some time(I have a lot to say here-- these ideas remind me of Ted Kaczynski's philosophies).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628742373,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8m7xod","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oy0a82","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8m7xod","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h8idd78","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/oy0a82\/got_into_buddhism_but_the_pessimist_sentiment_of\/h8m7xod\/","retrieved_on":1651705144,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Is the government creating plagues to kill people? Are wars engineered for the exploitation of natural resources? Do the elite ritualistically rape and kill children?

This probably isn't good news.\n\nAs for what occurs after death, I think what the brain often is it says \"I don't know\", and then in the same breath, is says \"I know\".

And we can either realize a fear of the unknown as an arbitrary evolutionary mechanism and stop letting it paralyze us, or we can just let the monkey brain invent the worst case scenarios **and** pretend like it believes them( also *merely* an evolutionary strategy, by the way), when we know we can't possibly have the evidence to a sufficient degree at this moment.\n\nIf you're overwhelmed with anxiety, just remember to ask:\n\n\"What is the **hard** evidence, right this moment?\"\n\nAnd notice that even in the worst case scenario-- what sense does it make to just drown in suffering?

Purely self-promotional values spreading, in contrast, wastes resources that could go toward mutually beneficial projects. \n\nI'm immediately thinking of two conditions I think are highly relevant here that color the practical context of values spreading. One is intentions, and two is traits(specifically, the big 5 trait of agreeableness and maybe also openness to experience).\n\nIt's possible to spread one's values with bad intentions, and not even be aware of this. It's possible to egocentrically try to convince others not because the truth is valuable(even in spite of one convincing *themselves* that this is their motive), or because what we believe really is ethical, and there is a point here despite this sounding profuse, but because we're often just egos that are very much like celestial objects in space, with a mass, and a gravitational pull-- \"fighting\"(even if subjectively we're interpreting this as \"helping\") with the various other masses around us. It's impossible to escape this problem in the broadest sense, so I'm not speaking about that sense, I'm just pointing out that there's a difference between spreading bad values for conscious reasons, spreading bad values for unconscious reasons, spreading good values for unconscious reasons, and good values for conscious reasons. We'd call the worst combination of this the \"hardest egocentrism\"(as opposed to the \"softest egocentrism\" that's inherent in spreading any kind of value) and \"badly intentioned\".\n\nEvery area of values spreading is covered here. This includes cases like a psychopath spreading good values for consciously bad reasons(To get ahead, to manipulate, to superficially signal ethics for the purpose of charming those around them, etc) or a person who can be called \"genuinely kind and possessing peak ethical values\"(if we had technology that could reliably scour their brains and phenomenology for any droplet of bad intent or selfishness-- we'd find zero or close to it). The second case is very uncommon in our world compared to the first, and most of us are probably some where in between these two extremes, but we should recognize that the second case is simultaneously the path *and* the goal when it comes to values spreading. Recognizing that as evolutionary agents, we're oriented to be right for bad reasons is therefore important, because only an awareness of this problem is going to fix it, both in ourselves and in others.\n\nIn the case of traits, it would be useful to consider how something like agreeableness(or specifically its absence) makes an intuitively good strategy in one light suddenly not so good in another. There are a lot of people who are very low in agreeableness because it is an evolved strategy that says, \n\n*\"This phenotype that has been successful all this time? Not changing. My phenotype's way, or the highway.\"*\n\nPsychopathy is going to be again, the useful case here: This is a condition where one can genetically dominate in zero-sum ways and be rewarded for it while avoiding the social repercussions through obscuring the situation via traits like deception or manipulation or charm. Low agreeableness is crucial to preserve the \"cheater\" values orientation here. Otherwise one could reliably just talk a psychopath out of their behavior. This, along with other traits like low-self awareness, low risk-aversion, fearlessness(this is implicit towards the fear of being wrong, or the fear of being unethical, or the fear of deceiving oneself), and a few others all work together to wrap the phenotype up in neat system.\n\nMost people aren't overtly\/profoundly psychopathic, but the point here is these traits function(much more subtly) the same in not just the average person, but \"what we're up against\" in the most serious ethical sense, institutions like governments(war, human torture, propaganda, injustice, inequality, etc), corporations(hazardous waste, environmental damage, inequality, injustice, propaganda, animal torture, etc), perhaps religions(the sexual and psychological abuse of children, religious war\/violence, etc) , political parties(general hostility and tension), these are all very rife with the sort of \"my way or the highway\" egocentrism I've described that really operates the same way whether one is in an unresolvable ideologically charged debate online, or whether one is in war zone, or whether one is completely subdued and at the mercy of a psychopath\/sadist\/torturer. These scenarios have one crucial feature in common: Negotiation won't be viable. Low agreeableness is the lifeblood of many(there are outliers\/gradients in specific value systems, yes) of these institutions due to these subtle psychopathic traits(because they're simply strategically beneficial evolutionarily\/game theoretically, but they're a losing strategy ethically). If we're \"playing against an opponent\" we know is low in agreeableness, it doesn't mean that convincing them is futile necessarily, but it does mean that convincing them is *very hard*. And this has to be taken into account because otherwise our theories on values spreading may just not work out when practically attempted.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628794525,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8osbpx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p32t7g","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8osbpx","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p32t7g","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/p32t7g\/values_spreading_is_often_more_important_than\/h8osbpx\/","retrieved_on":1651699753,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I have no idea what the person I'm speaking to specifically believes, but to speak only for myself, it seems like evil reliably wins due to the happenstance of physics being rule oriented, which gives rise to other rules(game theory, evolution). Once we acknowledge a game state containing rules, and we acknowledge no referee and finite resources, we can conclude that skilled cheating is going to win the game, given enough time. \n\nHow could anything else win? I'm asking in both the rhetorical and literal sense here, I can't imagine how, but I'd love to know if anyone knows. The best answer our brightest minds have been able to come up with is: \"The game is win-win\". I can concede there are win-win *elements*, but in the grandest sense the game is most certainly not win-win. The game is profoundly and transparently rigged if one simply looks around them. \n\nNo ultimate arbiter to punish cheaters means that if one wins the game, they can also engineer the game in self-serving ways, which causes one to further win the game. This would not be as big of a problem except genetics effectively \"extends the lifespan\" of a cheater indefinitely-- we are not necessarily speaking exclusively about people here. It's the genes that give rise to people. Cheater genes win here, on Earth. What do I mean by cheating? Well, the most meaningful way to speak of cheating is to speak ethically. Ethics contains the rules that can be broken so that one can win some more superficial game, such as the game of \"power\". Evil is not constrained by rules like good is, no matter what one's conception of ethics are here, if words mean anything at all. Evil can do everything good can insofar as it \"wins the power game\". But good can't do everything evil can, that's what it means to be good-- constrained by rules. \n\nThe facts the former ideas paint is a philanthropist billionaire can truly enrich the lives of children all over the world through charity work, while simultaneously raping and killing children in a dungeon-- this is compatible behavior only for evil, but not for good. In game theoretical terms, this means a major disadvantage, which will be expressed over time in a game with no referee. This again means no one to reliably punish cheaters\/solve the problem of cheating, given that evolutionary time creates cheater adaptation but due to the advantage of power, rigs the game further because goodness never achieves power to create \"anti-cheater\" feedback loops, but evil does gain power to create \"pro-cheater\" feedback loops. The prison system of punishment functions this way by creating selection pressures to morph sociopathy(overt anti-social behavior) into psychopathy(covert, cunning, skilled, \"successful\" anti-social behavior). Constrain the game with basic rules, and cheaters will emerge through selection pressure of policing these rules. We think this is justice and progress, but we are really just breeding perfected evil by doing this, not reducing it. \n\nThis is supported when one simply soberly assesses the past 3billion+ years of biological evolution(often referred to by analogy as a (NSFL)[\"meat grinder\"](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=153)), and then more specifically backed up by just looking at how humans and proto-humans have behaved for the past few hundred thousand years. Finally, one can look at more [recent human history](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Torture_chamber) in what we have recorded\/available. There's no question that something like the internet contains only the [smallest fraction of the horror humanity has engaged in](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/), but the traits seem very deeply embedded to the point that our recent \"Civilized status\" seems to be a fantasy idea we've all arranged a social contract around\/gameified in a way that benefits both predators and [victims](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KLpM0bo.jpeg). \n\nIf one is a domination monster, it helps them to not engineer(consciously or unconsciously) an overt hell, but rather a covert one, where they are not attacked and gnawed at by the bottom rungs of the world due to their nature(this explains psychopathy as [evolved camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv). We think of evolved camouflage as something we can intuit and see through. We think of it like this snake caterpillar which we can kind of see is just a clever strategy, although I hope this particular example is striking enough to show what can happen with large evolutionary timescales, to get the gears of intuition turning. But we fail to see evolved camouflage in the ultimate sense by definition, because such camouflage reliably deceives us. This is crucial to the way reality becomes obscured:\n\n If one is positioned as the victim of a domination monster, overt hell is clearly inferior to covert hell because both victim and monster lose, but in the covert hell at least the victims aren't guaranteed to be psychologically traumatized 24\/7. There is a certain win-win element here, so where such an element exists, it'll be taken, even though this win-win is superficial in the most meaningful sense and everyone loses as a result of it. The evil loses because it is robbed of the most deeply ethical and meaningful world, while the victims of evil clearly lose because they too are doomed to an evil world. This is how the zero-sum reality can sometimes masquerade as non-zero sum(even if the win-win condition is a meaningfully better world, it's still ultimately lose-lose by obscuring the *fact* that it is lose-lose).\n\n An overt hell is one where evil is plain to see, such as depicted in all our fiction, myths, movies, books, black\/white criminal justice system: Evil is depicted as some demonic thing, with teeth, horns, an aesthetic of darkness, the color \"red\", and overtly evil behavior. This simplistic depiction is not an accident of thousands of years of our own confusion. We're well aware that evil is not something so cartoonish. We've had more than enough time to accurately portray evil by now-- yet we still spread these memes. Our societies are structured around them. Our literature, our culture, churns out this narrative endlessly. Who benefits from such an idea? Once you consider psychopathy here being the ultimate winner, then it becomes more clear that there's a propagandistic, evolutionary, adaptive benefit in these memes, and this is traceable for many thousands of years, from the Babylonian Enuma Elish, all the way to Star Wars or Marvel films. We live in a world where evil(power) appears to overwhelmingly win(what even beats power? It's like asking what wins against the winner.), and the convenient narrative we are spoonfed from childhood says: \"Evil is recognizable, and plain to see\" when the reality of evil is the precise opposite.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628799208,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8p3k5e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_oytcwy","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8p3k5e","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h8om4bd","permalink":"\/r\/areweinhell\/comments\/oytcwy\/hell_the_sandbox_for_all_things_that_can_exist\/h8p3k5e\/","retrieved_on":1651699100,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"areweinhell","subreddit_id":"t5_yzbmg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/areweinhell","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Evil doesn't have some kind of perfect mind, even though it's the perfect strategy in practice. It *does* have the capacity for superior intelligence and plenty of room for attention and so on, it can certainly express itself as an \"All-seeing eye\", it's cunning and often highly conscious but on some level it has to lack self-awareness-- evil can't ever be omniscient under the maximally semantically meaningful definition because that implies awareness that evil is wrong ethically in a way that actually breaks down its own phenomenology.\n\nIt's just like being a child that deeply lacks insight, and thinking stealing is okay. So this child just steals with abandon, totally confused(forget that this is technically an optimization process under my own view, and all this child needs to do is learn to *perfectly* steal to \"win\"). Later this child has something stolen from it. It's not meaningfully a psychopath, so it's not constrained by evil behavior, so it gets to \"win\" this bit of insight: Stealing is wrong. It now has a firmware upgrade. It appreciates this new insight helplessly, and the character of this child changes.\n\nThe maximally winning evil can't do this in principle, but it's possible that through hiccups, sheer stupidity, sheer incompetence, sheer luck, evil will fail to orient itself towards perfect evil while trying to *express* its evil. This is what's happening in some sense when philanthropist billionaires genuinely enrich the world(not in a genuine way, since it's superficial\/lacking awareness that they are operating under psychopathic phenotypes, but genuine as in they really do enrich the world) to signal \"I'm the good guy\".\n\nThis is *still* the random expressions of genetic strategies, it's not some \"grand conspiracy\"(even though there's no doubt psychopaths conspire within mutual hallucinations based on who the apex psychopath(s) is\/are, and which narrative gets collectively taken on). Genes cannot conspire, so that's the window for hope.\n\nThe other hope is the fact that it really is non-zero sum for a psychopath to engineer a world that is not overtly a hellworld, and this is better than an overt hellworld where everything is too stupid\/too poorly oriented to optimize the game for everyone.

In what I wrote previously I'm describing a difference in two specific kinds of orientations that are compatible with that description of how people operate at an \"upper level\". I think if we're putting things in order, it's first things like these pattern\/detail orientations, they determine what we make of our visual field all the way to the words we read\/claims we encounter, and then we apply the heuristics you mentioned(along with other complexity this produces conscious thought, ie, \"We should trust our powerful institutions\/We should distrust our powerful institutions-- here i'm vastly oversimplying, there are endless heuristics here that lead to conclusions of trusting\/distrusting powerful institutions). \n\nSo I'm really describing \"orientation\" here in the broadest sense: What something is that influences ones phenomenology(what it's like to be something\/someone-- what kind of world one can see\/feel\/experience\/sense). High pixelation but a fuzzy\/no pattern, or low pixelation\/low granularity but high detail, and everything in between. I'm using the language of a computer monitor but I really mean this broadly too, not only in visual terms, but even holding claims in the mind like: \n\n\"powerful corporations plan to get rich using bio-surveillance\"\n\n+\n\n\"the government is responsible for our response to the pandemic\"\n\n+\n\n\"powerful corporations have large influence in government\"\n\n\n, while being utterly unable to connect any of these \"dots\", versus *over* connecting the dots in the case of extreme\/absurd conspiracies and paranoid schizophrenia. You can call the whole process \"heuristic\" both in referring to the conscious rules people will admit they operate on, all the way to the phenotypic expressions of these genes(compulsive detail detection, paranoia\/pattern seeking, etc)\n\n\n I don't know what you mean by:\n\n&gt; if one is to challenge these black and white conclusions, rarely is there much detail underneath. \n\nDo you mean we can't escape our heuristic orientation in general if we're oriented towards black and white thinking? I was thinking, to create a slightly less abstract example, about something like the nuance of semantics where people assume that logically something can't be some specific thing. But only a failure of accounting for paradox, exception, nuance, gradation, and so on, will cause one to reach that conclusion. You can almost *see* the heuristic effects or the inevitable orientation leading people astray if you just pay attention in your conversations to a question like \"Is this person oriented more towards detail or pattern, and is there a pathological result from an unoptimized orientation?\"\n\nI think in principle if one challenged a false dichotomy, they'd find detail-rich nuance, no? Or did you mean that Quantum Mechanics metaphor literally to say that reality truly is dualistic in some sense? I understood it broadly as \"Processing reality benefits from broadening our perspective dramatically, and one needs to be open to paradox and exception and ideas like superposition to process it meaningfully\", but maybe I'm just way off about what you mean so I'm curious if you could elaborate.

One never knows who is in a position of ignorance, so it's usually a sign of ignorance itself when we assume someone's stupid rather than simply correctly sees something we're not seeing. The only real way to hash this out is to point out areas of contention, ask questions, make claims that can be responded to, etc, while being open to changing our mind and updating it when new facts arrive, and valuing things like the truth over preserving our representations.\n\n&gt;  but you seem to be conflating ASPD with evil, since you are using a \"formal\" (but outdated and discontinued) term that refers to ASPD.\n\nYeah, I don't prefer \"ASPD\" because I think \"psychopathy\" captures the meaning better due to the sorts of associations we make with the word(ie, \"Ted Bundy was a notorious psychopath\" vs. \"Ted Bundy notoriously had 'anti-social personality disorder' \"). I think there's a certain gravity that's lost and downplayed with the term ASPD. I more or less dismiss psychiatry here significantly as some kind of authority on what a disorder is or isn't(I think the term personality disorder is itself loaded with baggage that implies certain pathological orientations from the field).\n\n I'm approaching the problem from the perspective of ethics\/philosophy, and just using the language of psychiatry that I think best suits what I'm trying to describe. I'm actually so critical of modern psychiatry(and its abhorrent history) that I'm a big fan of the phrase \"the lunatics run the asylum\", even today in 2021. Despite this, one is forced to use the language simply because a word like \"evil\" seems to many people ethically ambiguous, but it really is synonymous with what we associate as \"psychopathic\"(Simply imagine immense evil, and really get a clear picture of what the traits are of this immense, fictional evil are. In what *way* is this immense evil, evil? Whatever one ends up imagining, unless one is deeply confused about good and evil, they'll find a thing that very meaningfully shares traits with someone like Ted Bundy).\n\n&gt; That'd be nothing more than being biased against a different PD, which like SZPD, stems largely from abuse. \n\nNo actually I distinguish an orientation to harm others intentionally, and something like Schizoid, which *can* be antisocial but not in the same way. Really *anything* on the PD list can be \"antisocial\", this would even extend beyond PD and into conditions like depression-- truly anything psychiatry has an interest in can be antisocial. This is not the kind of \"antisocial\" I'm interested in or refer to when I say \"evil\". Also this isn't a matter of bias in some meaningful sense-- I actually don't have anything against psychopaths, I consider them simply unlucky human beings who were once children themselves, received ethically sub-optimal genes through no fault of their own, and then were almost certainly deeply abused as children, again through no fault of their own. \n\nPsychopaths are deeply unlucky people and I wouldn't ever say something like \"Psychopaths *deserve* to be punished for being evil\"-- that's a specific ethical claim that arises from a confusion that the idea of \"free will\" is coherent, and therefore are worthy of punishment(clearly, no one freely chooses to be born into the life of a psychopath, therefore it would make no sense to react to a Psychopath's existence with: resent, revenge, spite, punishment, justice-seeking, etc,-- I would actually label these very responses **as** psychopathic behavior itself).\n\n&gt; Can't tell you how many times I've been labeled a \"psycho\/path\" by total strangers and friends alike [... ]so there's no benefit to fueling it, in my mind. \n\nThat's very unfortunate to hear, yes, there's no question we can be ignorant about neurotypes. Ironically it's psychopathic behavior that fuels this abuse that you've received in being mislabeled as a psychopath-- this is a very classic cluster-B behavior that can be captured by the acronym \"DARVO\"-- which stands for: Deny, Attack, Reverse-Victim&lt;-&gt;Offender. It's famously applied to gaslighting(another psychopathic behavior) of sexual assault victims but it's more fundamental as the experience of even having an argument with a Cluster-B-- they will frequently employ this type of strategy. You won't generally be able to really target a psychopath or narcissist with an accusation. You won't be able to say: \"Hello Bob, I noticed you were quite cruel there.\" There's almost never going to be a straightforward: \n\n\"Oh, you're right. I don't know what came over me. I didn't notice the harm I was causing. I'm sorry.\" \n\nIt's like an impenetrable shield that defends via attack, through deflection. In theory you can get a psychopath to mislead someone and feign remorse, but really the common experience is a kind of cat-and-mouse game of never really being able to \"pin\" any accusation on the psychopath or narcissist-- this is generally how they've evolved to not get exposed\/unmasked, it's a much easier strategy to just endlessly lead one around and around in conversation rather than to simply pull off a very elaborate lie(they can do this sometimes, but the former strategy is simply less evolutionarily costly and also serves as a meaningful domination strategy rather than a submission, which is what Cluster-B is ultimately about at the genetic level-- distinguished from other genetic strategies which may be benign or benevolent adaptive strategies because they're not explicitly anti-social, even though we said everything can in some sense be antisocial, we're always speaking in the 'Cluster-B', deeply anti-social sense).\n\n&gt; Also, what's interesting is that true evil involves sadism. For sadism to exist in the brain, you must also possess empathy, which anti-socials cannot possess. \n\nHmmmm, yes, I think you're very close to being onto something. I'm not actually sure but I *suspect* sadism is possible independent of empathy in the harder sense(here we mean deep empathy in a model that recognizes that one wouldn't wish to experience what's being experienced and generally becomes an ethical actor as a result, although pathological empathy excesses can often paralyze people from ethical behavior). If we're speaking about empathy in the softest possible sense, which is, simply intuiting the mental states of others(I think it's more meaningful to call this \"Emotional intelligence\", but we have all kinds of controversy about intelligence-- I think it's worth ignoring this controversy here and simply recognizing which words are most meaningful) is required for sadism to function, because one couldn't know when their victim is harmed in order to feel pleasure from this harm.\n\nAll of that aside, psychopaths actually can possess empathy, they just don't care about the results like non-evil people do-- because they're motivated by other traits, namely sadomasochism and callousness. Sadomasochism(different from simple sadism, but this is a trick that orients the psychopath into empathic territory because they can feel the pain of someone else but also lack an ethical response because they simply are unconcerned by this due to callousness, and due to sadomasochism delight in it. This is distinct from sadism alone because the two-trait set of 'sadomasochism' makes them simultaneously resilient to \"taking punches\". \n\nYou know that trope in movies where the villain takes a direct punch by some B-tier protagonist, and then is unphased, has blood drawn from the face, licks the blood off, flashes a sadistic grin, and proceeds to dominate the B-tier protagonist to establish the concept of great evil+power for the main protagonist to be challenged by? That's \"the point\", but in the broadest sense possible. You can't harm a psychopath like you can a normal person, and this is usually caused by the abuse they endured and developed the psychopathic trait-set adaptation towards-- this is part of the mechanics of how psychopathy is developed in childhood-- It's like Navy SEAL training *without* consent or any good intention.\n\n&gt; They're not demons or serial killers from TV shows... They're people, and they're also disabled. Most antisocials have various bodily dysfunctions.\n\nI know you said the former part about sadism here while lumping all anti-socials into one big group, but again, it should be clear by now that I'm speaking of a *specific* type of 'anti-social'. A disposition to mislead others with the intention of doing so. A disposition to self-aggrandize. A disposition to intentionally harm, through motivations like sadism. A disposition to no fear, low risk-aversion, callousness, narcissism, and domineering behavior which causes a very precise orientation to cause a very precise ethical harm we could only call \"evil\" if words are to capture any deep nuance in a clear way. \n\nThis is distinct in my eyes from something like the lack of empathy or anti-social traits associated with something like autism or Schizoid. There's a difference to appreciate here-- an autistic person may cause frustration and receive alienation and may seem anti-social to outsiders due to a complete disconnect in their phenomenology with a more typical human, but there's no *truly* meaningful relationship between autism spectrum\/Schizoid and a disposition that can be called \"evil\"-- but there **is** with what I'm characterizing as psychopathy and similar 'ways of being' to it like narcissism, etc. Like I said earlier, none of this is to de-humanize evil people or not claim they're deeply unlucky or claim they should be punished-- I think these are all confusions(or worse, even *symptoms* of psychopathy itself, very often).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628820429,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8qfgh3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p32vx9","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8qfgh3","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h8q1qaq","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/p32vx9\/your_standpoint_re_society\/h8qfgh3\/","retrieved_on":1651696337,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Both cases made me wonder as to how such extreme self-control was achieved: perhaps with the aid of some kind of anaesthetising agent? Self-hypnosis (as per people who undergo surgery without anaesthetic)? Whether with or without, they are nevertheless extraordinary acts, motivated with an extreme degree of moral commitment.\n\nFirst time hearing about him here, but I just read the Wikipedia article. I'm guessing there's no award-winning photo of this one, so we can't see to compare, but I suspect the subjectivities here were very different. \n\n&gt; Regarding the conditions required to reach the state of non-identification: I agree, i.t.o. my experience; however as a beginner, I found it necessary to do so in as quiet an environment as possible - typically before the city woke up and started slamming doors and revving engines\n\nNon-identification would be independent of slamming doors and revving engines, though. That's what it means to not-identify. We could be just speaking about different things because I'll grant you that to perhaps even open the door to the most basic training, a peaceful environment will help expose the circus of the mind. In silence one truly only has the mind to witness in some sense, but even here, the mind functions identically whether it's dealing with thoughts it thinks are internal or revving engines and slamming doors which it thinks are external-- everything appears in the same singular experience field. \n\nI'll point to that a second time because it's not something that's common knowledge even to people who regularly train this way: The same place that contains the feeling of anger, is the same place that contains the revving of an engine, or slamming of a door. Even from a neurologically, scientifically accurate description of subjectivity, the portions of your body you're seeing that rest in your external environment are all contained *inside* of your brain. Purely in experience there's no difference between these two objects **if** one is paying attention. If one is engaged in thought, there's delineation here. It's in examining that nature that tends to lead one over a very long time towards something like non-identification, speaking purely of introspection here and not something like psychedelic drugs or natural disposition(the \"disordered\" conditions of dissociation, depersonalization, etc), although these states can be loopholes to the same experience.\n\n&gt; Your example of a domestic dispute raises an interesting point regarding empathy, and anger being a catalyst for action in righting a perceived wrong. I can sort of appreciate your point if, for example, one were to knock on the neighbour's door, only to discover that the source of the dispute was an enactment on a loud television.\n\n&gt; To be clear, I am not denigrating the utilitarian value of being able to operate in the world from the perspective of no-self, but I stand my starting point of this exchange, that it is just another mental phenomenon, and one that must be cultivated through committed practice in order to make it habitual (i.e. it doesn't come naturally). There is also the danger of \"no-self\" resulting in a callous manner of behaving in the world: I recall seeing documentary footage of a buddhist monastery (I think it was in Tibet); one of the senior monks, presumably a person with a life-time of meditation under his belt, was approached by a clearly distressed woman during the recording; he brushed her aside as if her presence and behaviour were a nuisance. It was an instructive moment.\n\nI'm not sure what you mean in the first part here, and the feeling of if you've understood my point isn't appearing strongly either. The only thing that comes to mind is there's an inherent kindness that comes from non-identification because one is truly separate from anything that can be called \"anti-social\", this is *inherently* social, even though intuitively one would think that it must also not be identified with something social, but this isn't the case, and instead we're left with this paradox. This is supported by the stories and evidence of people isolating for many years to introspect and beaming with genuine love towards all beings, but never the opposite, although there are certainly problems with bad behaving(or simply psychopathic\/sadistic) gurus, so it's possible to be considered a teacher and miss the point somehow(even if one does contain genuine wisdom\/expertise in training the mind). There's also the case of genuine charlatans here who are both unskilled and deceptive. Either way, let me know what you mean\/what you think I mean about the domestic violence being the barrier to meditation you seem to think it is.\n\n&gt; Another reason I assert that meditation requires extraordinary dedication is because it involves undermining our evolved \"bias against self-knowledge\" - the mental processes that mask our true motivations - the evolutionary explanation being that, if we can lie to ourselves to enhance our inclusive fitness, we can lie more convincingly (with more sincerity) to others for the same selfish purpose, in the context of a species of status-seeking social primates. While these insights are valuable from the moral, truth-seeking and sense-making standpoints, they come at the cost of a deeply unsettling re-evaluation of one's self-identity (in the sense of how an individual navigates the \"normal\" day-to-day world . I am sure you would agree that pursuing such a practice in this context requires extraordinary dedication. \n\nOh I've already granted you that point-- the greatest benefits at least do require a lot of time, it's a lifetime practice, really, there's never some moment where one goes, \"Okay, *finally*, now I never have to meditate again\". I'm also with you that we're deeply biased about our motivations and intentions for evolutionary reasons. Meditation undermines this because it's a kind of commitment to honesty-- one can see awareness this way. One will know if they have bad intentions to the fullest meaning that's possible of that term in the context of evolutionary machines that are oriented to exploit their social environment. I think this is deeply related to ethics because I think unethical behavior is to some real degree grounded in a deficit of awareness, also for strategic reasons. The deeply unsettling cost you refer to is only deeply unsettling if one fails to gain the benefits of meditation-- which is awareness and a loss of identification with thought, emotion, sensation.

In this case, Is this an attack from a neighboring country, or a collusion for the top of the human pyramid to dominate the bottom? \n\n* Are vaccines safe? \n\n* Are they safe in *this* case, since this is distinct from something like the flu and being used to completely re-structure society in the same post-9\/11 style some of us are familiar with?\n\nand countless others.\n\nSo my answer here is actually contrary to everyone who has a strong opinion either way-- both those associated as \"anti-vaxxers\" or roughly adjacent, to someone who thinks it's obvious that the world should rush and get vaccinated: It doesn't seem to *really* matter, it's somewhat of a coin flip.\n\nThis is not an endorsement for what you should do, this is simply my own perspective, so take it with a grain of salt because we're all basically blind here when we're in these conditions of obfuscation. But I don't think the main purpose of vaccinations is to inject someone with some maliciously associated substance, like perhaps the peak-paranoia\/insecurity\/fear that drives anti-vax + any adjacent views. I also don't think it seems to matter for people who already got vaccinated because the new narrative is: \"SCARY NEW MUTATIONS! IS ONE OR TWO VACCINATIONS ENOUGH? ARE WE PERPETUALLY GOING TO BE IN A STATE OF VACCINATION?!\"\n\nAny malicious utility here is through the actual social engineering involved. Like anything else the media or government propaganda exercises, the main utility is in reshaping the world, moving to an online society, controlling the movement and the gatherings of people and constraining them to be at home, and on their devices in a way that's even more maximized than the previous state of affairs. The anxiety-inducing narrative is simply the name of the game of the propaganda memes that religion and government have been colluding to socially engineer society with for time immemorial, so that's ingrained here too. You should be afraid and insecure(and politically divided, and now on top of race, sex\/gender, class, nation, religion, and political orientation, you're now to be divided on if you vaccinate or not-- this is clearly an ancient strategy outlined by famous dominators in history, and it's no surprise that we see it everywhere today).\n\nSo purely intuitively, I just think the odds seem good that it doesn't *matter*-- the vaccines could be pure placebo or not for the sake of engineering the world. This is not making a claim about what's actually the reality of vaccines, it's a statement about what is *necessary* to engineer the world in a way that benefits elites during a pandemic, and it's simply true that the vaccines could be genuine **for this purpose**, which they almost certainly are, or they could be saline solution and it simply wouldn't matter **for this purpose**(of engineering)-- a crucial semantic distinction that can be taken out of context.\n\nLikewise the virus deaths to the virus could be vastly obfuscated in bullshit( in both directions ), and almost no one would be the wiser, because everyone is operating to some real degree on \"the official narrative\". Virtually no one is going \"Flat earth levels\" of insanity and saying no one has died from Covid and that the vaccine is water(they *are* saying the vaccine is... magnets, or chips, which is close, but interesting that no one who is offering a \"crazy\" representation offers a \"crazy\"-but-*parsimonious* representation.\n\nIn short, you're so in the dark whether you realize it or not on this issue, even if you're an epidemiologist(this in some sense risks making you *more* in the dark than the random informed citizen due to the proximity of propaganda\/narrative), that it's really a coinflip you shouldn't think too hard on as to whether you should vaccinate. You won't get microchipped, but there's no guarantee you won't be murdered if psychopaths in power intend to murder you. Do whatever your heart desires, flip a coin, or do nothing.

Another very popular and accessible teacher online that I've found useful is [Joseph Goldstein](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3Uqoxo_jPXQ)-- very plain language, very good at teaching(guided meditations, also philosophy), and any Buddhist doctrine here I think is also easily translatable into some kind of rational ethics, conceptions and mechanics of suffering, values, practice, and so on. \n\nFor something more phenomenological or scientific, two flavors I've been entertaining more recently have been Thomas Metzinger(heavy science and philosophy of phenomenology in way that re-affirms Buddhist ideas, significant meditation background which is framed in the language of neuroscience\/cog sci and analytic philosophy) and [Richard Lang](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ut80ECJ3D3g)(Like Metzinger he has a heavy approach towards phenomenology and describing the nature of experience, but not science-y and more philosophically Buddhist, although in a very plain-language way.

Let's look at this caricature of \"fat phobia\". First, it should be obvious that there's a kind of hostility someone can use when they're the discriminated party that ends up just being abuse against abusers(or what ends up happening: abuse against potential allies or innocent people-- this characterizes I think the core problem with the way \"social justice\" exists in the West, even if social justice as a concept, broadly speaking, is benevolent. We want social justice, sans quotes, but \"social justice\" in quotes, is very controversial. This is why.).\n\nSo this is true, the victim and the offender *could* be reversed through a kind of abusive moving the goal posts(indeed, the acronym \"DARVO\" covers this strategy which is used by psychopaths to gaslight and deflect blame onto victims when they're accused of a harm, simultaneously making the offender the victim, and the victim the offender), we see this in your analogy, we see this in something like CRT, and so on. But... and here's the problem and here's the nuance:\n\nThere's *genuine* discrimination against fat people. It's widespread, and not a fringe problem. If you're fat, your life is almost guaranteed to be pretty bad in some significant way. It's one of the easiest things to ostracize someone over. We're not talking about the status of being a Sumo wrestler in Japan. We're talking about being a kid(or and adult), in an environment where this specific difference reliably leads to ostracism and serious psychological harm. Does this mean we need to bend the knee and say \"fat is beautiful\"(silence on this would be violence to make things more insane) and we don't find fat beautiful, then we're monsters? No... that's... insane. And anyone who pretends as if we should force this concept on others with serious consequences, is insane. But tunneling only on that insanity, and ignoring the insanity of psychopathic children and psychopathic adults bullying, ostracizing real human beings and the broad harm these real people face is a failure of ideological(usually politically delineated) divisiveness.\n\nWhat can we learn from this nuance and the idea of \"intellectual classism\"?\n\nLike with the former problem, there's definitely an insane version that really is only interested in a self-serving dominance game. It works like this:\n\n We invent intellectual classism to mean \"Anything that deviates from my ignorant and narrow representation of the world **must** be discrimination\" and then... just run with it. That's batshit insane, clearly. That needs to not be tolerated. But there's this *other* problem, right? It's just a little more nuanced, unfortunately, that class elitism and the ivory tower phenomenon, aren't fantasies, okay? There's a real problem where an entire academic, or political, or other institution(historically religion did this with dogma) could just throw the gavel down and say \"This **is** how it is.\" That's insane too, and we need to stop that problem too. If we only tunnel on the former insanity, we are forgetting the latter insanity. The problem is really *just* insanity that isn't divided politically or along gender\/race. Humanity just happens to be insane, and we forget this when we LARP within our identity groups. \n\nAnd to really drive the point home: this doesn't exclude LARPing in the \"Rational educated science literature reading college graduate\" group, but there's no other game in town in *principle*(**not** in practice-- in practice, all of academia could just be mentally ill right at this moment like the entire field of psychiatry was in the lobotomy\/insane asylum era), so we at minimum need to agree to value things like truth and honesty, and reject our own egomania and identity narratives. We know that if we fail to value honesty and truth, I mean **really** value it like our life depends on it, we will fail in the most meaningful sense it is possible to fail in.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628893851,"distinguished":null,"edited":1628894074.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8uatpf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p2e024","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8uatpf","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p2e024","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/p2e024\/intellectual_classism_is_the_new_fat_phobia\/h8uatpf\/","retrieved_on":1651688187,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

There's a reason why intelligence isn't stereotypically sexy. A genetic reason. Intelligence is easy to fake, even when the judge is themselves intelligent. It's just never clear because if you're smart, you recognize the value of humility and go \"Well, hmm, let me not assume that this smart person who sounds stupid right now is stupid, let me just look into their point and commit to taking them seriously\", while if you're stupid, you're just powerless to the wiles of their long con if they're being deceptive.\n\nThere's also the problem that the natural state of our world is [hellish](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=153). Intelligence to some degree means that you recognize this fact, since intelligence is strongly related to recognizing facts. This means that there's a real risk with intelligence. There's clearly a payoff to intelligence, because you can also solve problems if you're intelligent, but there's far more problems in a hellworld than there are solutions, and far more ways to be wrong than right. If this is true, then intelligence is just *too costly* in evolutionary terms-- intelligence is maladaptive because it makes one recognize that things are hell and have no practical solutions(if you think there are easy solutions to big problems, you haven't thought about them deeply enough), which favors stupid, strong, optimistically biased monkeys over even smart, strong(physically), realistic monkeys.\n\nEdit: I forgot to the include the crucial point that there's a positive scaling between things like depression\/anxiety\/suicide rate and intelligence to support the above idea. Ignorance really is bliss, and evolutionary forces care about bliss in hell, not recognizing hell as hell. Being in touch with reality is not good for the genes, but believing in the wind demon god that happens to make you not die to the cheetah in rustling grass(or reminds you that God loves you and will make it all okay, and incentivizes holy wars), A-okay. That's how unintuitive the genes are, because they only care about one thing: Winning in the most superficial, pointless sense possible-- making more copies of itself.\n\nThis is why purely dominant traits are sexy: Power(simply synonymous with domination), money(should be obvious that money means opportunities and status and therefore power), high status(needs no explanation), humor(humor is a kind of emotional domination that is always at minimum, in *some* perspective, positive\/useful because it obscures the fact of hell).\n\nA pro-social psychopath of totally average or even below average intelligence has far better odds of being seen as a mate, than a 200 IQ autist, for this reason.\n\nIt's a good thing in some sense that we are skeptical of intelligence, so there's some way to steelman \"r\/Iamverysmart\", even though it's true that this expresses anti-intellectualism. It often captures people who are being deceptive and just trying to appear profound(r\/im14andthisisdeep) and it's good that we reject this, but it's bad that we bully people this way, and the price we pay for this phenomenon is that we shit on people who are *genuinely* smart, or *genuinely* deep, and make [sacrifices of them](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Child_sacrifice) for evolutionary gain, while robbing ourselves of genuine insight. \n\nIn the end, intelligence isn't even as valuable as people believe it is. You can have an IQ of 1 million in principle, and be deeply evil-- there's no incompatibility here, and that's because there are *other* traits that are worth more than simply being intelligent: an orientation to what is true, an orientation to ethics, etc. You can be brilliant while being a compulsive liar with no self-awareness. Psychopaths appear very intelligent. We have the meme of \"So smart they're stupid\", and it's not solved by simply more intelligence. It's a problem because there's a failure of values\/traits that lead to what we call \"stupidity\" there. You can add intelligence forever and make some supercomputer mega AI in principle, and *still* end up with it being evil, because traits which lead to values are the crucial causal variable, not intelligence alone.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628894793,"distinguished":null,"edited":1628928980.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8ucywo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p2e024","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8ucywo","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h8m303b","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/p2e024\/intellectual_classism_is_the_new_fat_phobia\/h8ucywo\/","retrieved_on":1651688073,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

The bovine species is simply being tortured. It's the *genome* enjoying the fruits. It is the genes who are meaningfully replicating, it's what they're trying to do in some sense. If genes could speak coherently, they'd admit so: \n\n&gt; \"We're trying to replicate, we don't care about anything else.\n\nThis is quite distinct from *if* cows could speak meaningfully. The cows would say something like:\n\n&gt; \"Just... please.... end this hell. Please. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! WHY ARE YOU FUCKING EATING THAT SOY BURGER. END THIS FUCKING HELL. THIS ISN'T FUCKING WORKING. END. IT. I'M BEING T-O-R-T-U-R-E-D. END THE FUCKING HELL. PLEASE. WHAT IS THIS??!! WHAT.... THE FUCK....

The genes have a \"gun to the head\"s of the cows.(like the humans do too) The species, from the perspective of a conscious being, loses where the genes win. This is why I make the distinction between genomes and the species.\n\nAny semantics around what a species is or isn't beyond this point isn't important here I don't think, because this is really just a question of values, both our values in what we think of as a meaningful or not meaningful value(ie, what does it mean to say a species **values** being tortured in a factory farm?), and in the values of the things we're speaking of(the values of species, the values of genes, the values of individuals).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628897923,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8ujss8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p3r3x2","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8ujss8","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h8uhu9y","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/p3r3x2\/the_fact_that_nature_is_being_romanticized_is_a\/h8ujss8\/","retrieved_on":1651687657,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Each Organism is a Genome, a Species is a large groups of Genomes (Organisms) in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes or mating types can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction.\n\nYou seem to just not be taking my word for it and seem to think the only way to say genome is to speak of a singular organism. I don't know what else to tell you, really. Just take a look at this article and try to put that definition to test:\n\n https:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/d41586-021-01506-w\n\nMany uses of the word \"genome\" in this article will be incoherent if one is *strictly* thinking of genome meaning \"A single organism\". Anyway, this is purely semantic, right? Since you're aware of what I mean, this is just a disagreement\/misunderstanding about the meaning of words.\n\n&gt; the Species only cares about its fitness, the survival of the fittest, meaning, the amount of Organisms it can produce.\n\nWell clearly this isn't the case because we know that humans can collectively reject fitness, reject survival, and reject producing organisms. Right? It can't be that the interest of a *species* is the driver here because if the species could know what's going on, then they wouldn't do what they're doing. It's only through ignorance of the genetic drives that a species could express the genetic drives. This is why I think it's meaningful to say a species loses being enslaved and tortured in a factory farm scenario, not wins. It's the *genes* that win, because it's the *genes* that care about mindless replication. The species can be said to \"care about mindless replication\" only in a superficial way, since the entire cow species would gladly escape the factory farm conditions\/self-terminate, if they could only intuit what's going on. \n\nThis is true *even* if they **couldn't** intuit what is going on, even though the values of factory farming clearly benefit the genes. The genes again do not care if cows are tortured. **Cows do care if cows are tortured**. If this is too abstract for you, replace cows with humans. Aliens enslave the entire human species.

There isn't such thing as a Genome representative of a Species. \n\n* \"A complete human genome sequence is close\"\n\nDo you think they're talking about one person using this context?\n\n* \"When the sequencing of the human genome was announced two decades ago by the Human Genome Project and biotech firm Celera Genomics, the sequence was not truly complete. \"\n\n\"The\" human genome? Who is \"the\" human? \n\n&gt; The Human Genome Project was the international research effort to determine the DNA sequence of the entire human genome.\n\n\"The\"? Who is this specific human? Why not say: \"effort to determine the DNA sequence of an entire human genome\"? This would be grammatically correct. To use the phrase \"the human genome\" is just strange, no?\n\nFrom Wikipedia's glossary of genetic terminology:\n\n&gt; genome\n    \n &gt;&gt;The entire complement of genetic material contained within the chromosomes of an organism, organelle, or virus. The term is also used to refer to the collective set of genetic loci shared by **every member of a population or species**, regardless of the different alleles that may be present at these loci in different individuals.\n\n(my emphasis in bold)\n\nAnyway, we're really both just drowning in the quicksand of semantics at this point. We can feel free to settle on \"gene pool\" if it's less confusing.\n\n&gt; For our civilization, for the individuals that Slavery was a failure, but for our species\n\nAgain, here's the confusion. It's always just individuals in the civilization. That's what \"human species\" means. There's no one outside of this scope. Everyone you could possibly include in the scenario of aliens torturing a species, loses in this scenario(In case some kind of black-and-white thinking is operative, I'll spell it out. When you torture **every single human individual**, this also by definition means you torture the entire species). The winners are the genes, the species loses, because members of a species are conscious, while genes aren't. This is why context under which genes lose is if they fail to replicate, but the context under which the species loses(you know, where the people are?) is if they get tortured. This is why you can say the phrase \"The human species has been tortured\" and make sense, yeah? But you can't say \"The human genome has been tortured\" and make sense.\n\n&gt; You see, you are romanticizing Individuals (Organisms) as if \"our\" interests and vulnerabilities were the same as those of the Species\n\nNo I'm actually not doing that and have no interest in romanticizing individuals, because I recognize individuals and organisms can have a variety of interests in principle, or happen to appear gene-oriented\/gene-value overlapping in practice. That's not the confusion here. The confusion here is from assuming that a species benefits from the same values(loosely speaking) that genes possess. That's how it seems you're using the word \"species\", while simultaneously making it seem like the sum of human-level value(like not getting tortured) can't be called \"a species\". You seem to be saying the species is the totality of genetic values. What I'm saying is the species is the totality of values oriented beings, who would always prefer not to be tortured if they could only appreciate such a value. This is true of humans(the human species), and this is true of cows(the bovine species).

But psych meds can be an invaluable tool for improving someone's quality of life. \n\nSure, I think that kind of nuance is compatible with what I'm saying. I'm able to separate the fact that it's simply true that there are pharmacological treatments to mental conditions(I think our current treatments have glaring flaws, despite sometimes being useful-- I think it'd be crazy to equate all psychiatric drugs with placebo, so that's quite far from my position). My criticism is really just the way the entire system seems to revolve around bad incentives\/exploitation, and there's room even to criticize the drugs themselves. \n\nThe fact of psychiatric drugs seeming to work sometimes is to me not the most significant fact to point out about the drugs. The significant fact is the suffering that is prevented, **not** the drugs or their effectiveness. We fail to see often that there's not necessarily a meaningful connection between these variables, and we can simply look to the fact that placebo works sometimes to remind ourselves. It's simply true that these drugs are **not** at the level of something like insulin, and here's how the human brain interprets a message like this. Ready? This is literally how the stream of thought goes in the mind:\n\n* 1) \"This guy is saying ... the drugs are bad!\"\n\n* 2) \"The drugs saved my\/my family\/my friends\/someone's life... that.... that means the drugs are good!\"\n\n* 3) \"What this guy is saying... must be bad!\"\n\nIt's not this simplistic as a final product, we still bear the burden of attempting to map some kind of nuance and narrative onto this, but this is how it works, and it leads to our confusion, because we don't always succeed in the former burden. I think the effectiveness of the drugs really is trivial here, by the way. The drugs could work 100% of the time and be seen as a true cure for depression and this wouldn't change anything about the dystopian nature of the system; this wouldn't change the fact that the theories the drugs are founded on are pernicious, perhaps intentionally so to some unknown degree. This wouldn't change the fact that there's real exploitation going on versus genuine care\/treatment. This wouldn't change the fact that the incentives behind engineering these drugs involve things like the following from [this article](https:\/\/astralcodexten.substack.com\/p\/contra-drum-on-the-fish-oil-story):\n\n&gt; There’s an antidepressant called Sinequan. It comes in pills of various sizes, starting at 10 mg. It’s not a very good antidepressant, but it does tend to make people very sleepy after they take it. Sinequan is extremely cheap, about $10 per patient per month.\n\n&gt; And there’s a sleeping pill called Silenor. It comes in pills of various sizes up to 6 mg. It’s a pretty good sleeping pill, and weirdly enough if you take a high enough dose of it you might also feel less depressed. Silenor is extremely expensive, about $250 per patient per month.\n\n&gt; Both Sinequan and Silenor are the exact same chemical, doxepin hydrochloride. Basically any dose of doxepin will make you sleepy, and higher doses also decrease depression. Maximum recommended dose is 300 mg\/day, so both the 6 mg Silenor dose and the 10 mg Sinequan dose are nowhere near it.\n\n&gt; You might wonder: given that these are the same chemical, why don’t people who need sleeping pills use Sinequan instead of Silenor and save $240\/month? The answer is: the FDA has approved the Silenor brand for sleep, but not the Sinequan brand. Nobody really knows if we are supposed to be pretending that the 6 mg vs. 10 mg dose matters (it doesn’t) or whether we’re just supposed to lie back and not trouble ourselves with such questions.\n\n&gt; There’s no mystery about how we got into this situation: the Silenor brand paid $100 million to get the FDA to classify them as a sleeping pill, and the Sinequan brand didn’t. This means Silenor has a monopoly on doxepin for sleep, and they know this, so they charge $250\/patient\/month, ie $3000\/year.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628962158,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8xlhmn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p3vrtg","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8xlhmn","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h8wopc0","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/p3vrtg\/work_led_me_to_suicide_and_now_i_have_this_bill\/h8xlhmn\/","retrieved_on":1651681285,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Now I've reaffirmed to myself what bad games look like.\"(You can only do this if you actually put serious effort into *playing* the game, right? This would be like watching 15 minutes of a movie or just watching all it while paying zero attention or being pedantic for 2 hours, not liking it, and then saying \"That was the worst movie I've ever seen\"). So cooperation and effect really *means* something here, for this game.\n\nGames have rules, right? For them to be meaningful, you have to follow the rules at minimum. The rules of this game are very simple, because it just involves imagining ourselves in a scenario. Rather than just be natural, and react instantly to things, this time, the rule is to make an effort to pay so much attention to the next ideas, that someone will torture us for 40 years if we miss the point or are dishonest. On top of this, God is going to reward us both if we get this next part right, okay? We each get a billion dollars. The second rule is for you to re-read the rules. It's really important here. Those are the rules of the game. Now, the actual game is getting the *following* right:\n\n==== Game ====\n\nWhat does it *mean* for someone to ask someone a question like this:\n\n&gt; Purely out of curiosity-- what would it take for you to admit that genome has multiple meanings? \n\nAnd have it be responded to, with this:\n\n&gt; There aren't different meanings, there is only one meaning\n\nWhile ignoring the actual question.\n\n=====End=====\n\nAll you have to do in this game, to remind you, is to answer the above with your total attention and honesty while pretending that we'll both get a billion dollars and not be tortured if you just manage to get the answer right. What does the above scenario say about the people speaking? It should be obvious that someone doesn't believe the proposition \"The word 'genome' has multiple meanings\". The question being asked is **what would it take**, right? Not the same opinion that has been repeated over and over, but rather, what are the conditions that would cause a change of mind? That's the question. Now this game is not about answering \"What would it take\". This game is **just** about figuring out what it means for someone to ignore such a question, and instead repeat the same thing they've been repeating over and over? What does it say about the person responding this way? What does it mean about the quality of the conversation? I'll set the bar even lower. If you can just tell me something meaningful(wrt the conversation) about the psychology or the personality of the person saying \"There aren't different meanings\", I'll count it as a win here.\n\nCare to play this game? Purely up to you, okay? Won't hold it against you if you don't want to play. Best of luck, I genuinely hope we both win big.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628964575,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8xr2ji","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p3r3x2","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8xr2ji","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h8w8ne6","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/p3r3x2\/the_fact_that_nature_is_being_romanticized_is_a\/h8xr2ji\/","retrieved_on":1651680935,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Or beer? What if those things truly enrich your life in a non-trivial way? Imagine a coffee-loving or beer-loving gradient, among those who do consume these things(no one who'd say \"I dislike coffee\", etc). It really is a big difference to tell someone on the highest end of that gradient \"You should cut that unnecessary drink out of your life\" compared to someone who really can do so with ease. \n\nNo one can account for the fact of one's orientation to these things any more than they can account for something like sexuality-- you like what you like, helplessly. And if you ever change your mind about what you like, you can't account for that either without having some confused ideas about delineations around personal identity and causality.\n\nI think all of this is perfectly compatible with the concept of frivolously buying things, but it's just more nuance.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1628966153,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h8xuobx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p40jjm","locked":false,"name":"t1_h8xuobx","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_p40jjm","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/p40jjm\/the_myth_of_the_myth_of_the_latte_millionaire\/h8xuobx\/","retrieved_on":1651680741,"score":10,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

One seems to be what the effects of QM and Many Worlds have on pessimism. The short answer is these ideas open the potential for whatever is bad to get incomprehensibly worse. Even in the event of MWI being completely false, there's still the problem of infinity, which could easily function as a kind of pseudo MWI if one re-frames their perspective, given our inability to see the concept of time correctly(we subjectively feel time passes, when physics tell is there is no such thing as what our senses make us feel with respect to time, there's simply a block universe containing past, present, and future).\n\nSo basically all the concerns more or less match up regardless if Many Worlds is true or not. Many Worlds is still worse, because it's another dimension of infinity on top of our current dimension(potentially infinite ranges of infinities within infinities-- or something like that\/close to that). And we know with just the nature of things, there are countless ways for things to go wrong in general, and far fewer ways for things to go right. This means most universes\/worlds are probably on the \"bad\" gradient of possibilities.\n\nSo yeah, that's a big problem to identify: The problem of sentience isn't contained just on Earth, even though that's what our ant-like perception tells us, often. The problem is incomprehensibly large, it seems( even if various interpretations of physics are wrong).\n\n&gt; but after all im learning i no longer believe in -eternal oblivion after death- as many atheists do.\n\nI still think there's no good reason to think the experience we have in the \"temporal subject self-modeling\" sense now will somehow magically persist after death. We have *some* evidence, even though no one has died. We know that there's no subjectivity prior to being born, or no subjectivity we'd find meaningful because there's no brain for memories to be, right? And even in the context of this brain, there's no phenomenological content of something like dreamless deep sleep-- the lights are just off for us here. We do not seem to experience. Based on this alone I think we have enough to imagine there's probably no magic soul persisting. If anything, there's the permanent subjectivity of eternalism, but we don't have a good reason to worry that we experience that right now any more than we have to worry about some awful pain that happened to us many years ago. There's no evidence of \"Okay, re-wind the tape-- make the subject experience once again\", as far as I can see.\n\nAnyway, all speculation, who knows what will happen. But if we don't know, we should truly admit that and express that position. Often times when we say we truly don't know, we'll *pretend* as if this means we know while we forget that we actually *don't*, in fact, know (ie, \"This seems to be a UFO! An **unidentified** flying object! That means aliens are real!\"). Then we base various emotional responses on this thing we can't possibly know. \"What if the aliens are hostile? Oh God, what a nightmare\" etc etc. This is what the human brain does when presented with ignorance. It evolved a constant narrative generator because to humans, ignorance is intolerable.

So the state may force you to join the army against your will, force you to die against your will to protect flimsy ideals such as patriotism and so forth. However, if you want to commit suicide, it's a big no-go. \n\nThe only way I can make sense of this behavior is to imagine that some people have a predisposition to have some positive views on authority and power and the status quo, while others have the opposite disposition.

People sometimes forget to ask themselves even this fundamental question, which *has* an answer, whether one knows it or not. We are value-oriented beings, so *some* values are operative right now. What are they, precisely?\n\nOnce we figure this out, the next question is: \"*Should* we be valuing this? If not, what?\"\n\nWe can just go with the cliche red pill\/blue pill, eating steak in the Matrix scenario. Is enjoying blissful ignorance in the Matrix, or is one awake and struggling? Is there a way to struggle in the former scenario? Is there a way to not struggle in the latter scenario?\n\nLess abstractly, in our world: Is it possible to suffer deeply while being blissfully ignorant that our reality is of a negative nature? Is it possible to have a worthwhile life despite knowing that our reality is of a negative nature?\n\n&gt; It feels fucking pointless\n\nLet's look at the actual argument for a moment. Earlier you wrote that knowing the truth means nothing if things will never get better *significantly*, in a way that redeems the bad elements of the world. I don't think this is true, because we know that even in rigged games, where the rules of the rigged game determine only a superficial, meaningless winner(I believe this to be a description of our world), a meta-game always can emerge where one employs the rules of another game, and attempts to win *that* game within the context of the rigged game. You can't win the ethics game or even the truth game, in our world. \n\nThat is simply because the power game wins here in ultimate terms. Remember when you said you are powerless? This is because you are crushed under the gravity of the powerful, who further rig the power game in their favor-- this is a loophole you can never overcome without being so powerful yourself, in which case you would be a being who further rigs power games, by definition. But it's simply true that you are not without moves. If you convinced yourself sufficiently, you could just begin torturing animals right now. Would that be an okay strategy to employ, for the power game? In so far as you didn't get caught by a member of your social species who disapproves, probably. But this would be a pretty bad strategy both for the ethics game, and the truth game. In fact, in many ways, *playing* the power game scales appropriately with *losing* the ethics game. Recognizing this is a kind of power(knowledge is a form of power-in-principle), and recognizing it is to helplessly play the truth game. But even though knowledge is a form of power, it doesn't mean knowledge is a way to win the power game. The only way to win the power game, is sheer power, whatever that is, and sheer knowledge\/intelligence is not the strategy here, otherwise we would not see depression, anxiety, and suicide rate scale so well in intelligent individuals.\n\nThe point is that even though the game is lost in the most important sense it ~~can~~(seemingly can't-- edit) be won in(ethics), it can still be lost to various degrees. The game is simply now a matter of losing it the least, which *can* be done. We *can* in principle be monsters right now by simply not caring about ethics, declaring things are pointless, wallowing in egocentrism, neuroticism, and so on, *or* we can make real ethical differences. It's not that this world is such a hell that you cannot rescue an animal from a torturer. It's not that this world is such a hell that you cannot save someone from *any* abuse scenario if you encounter it, or tell a suffering person some psychologically healing words. These are facts, and this is not incompatible with determinism-- you still have to make choices in determinism, and doing evil, vs. doing nothing, vs. doing good, still have real implications ethically, even in rigged games.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629051670,"distinguished":null,"edited":1629410076.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h925cpl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p4rm85","locked":false,"name":"t1_h925cpl","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_p4rm85","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/p4rm85\/if_there_was_a_button_that_took_you_back_to_when\/h925cpl\/","retrieved_on":1651671634,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I know plenty of vegans with pets. \n\nI think the problem is more nuanced, and there are even arguments against the keeping of pets, but we'll lay that aside for now because we don't need to say all keeping of pets is unethical to make the point here.\n\nI think the key concern for vegans is exploitation. The idea of taking something from a being, regardless if they can express or intuit the ideas of exploitation, being generally unethical. That is a view I personally sympathize with, despite not being vegan. We don't, in quite the meaningful way as with a chicken or a cow we keep for the purposes of eggs\/milk, \"take things\" from our dogs or cats. We're not *extracting* something tangible from them to represent theft. This is the crucial difference between merely having a companion pet, and having a thing you're nice to, but also steal from and cause to suffer for this purpose.\n\nAnd if this is all difficult to intuit, I find the vegan argument of simply putting yourself in the shoes of the being who is exploited useful, and imagine confused but sometimes benevolent aliens treating you this way-- and you lack the capacity to even realize the depth of the ethics in this scenario. This doesn't say that you don't in *some* sense realize the ethics, because [cows are tortured](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg) in a way that is quite unambiguous ethically for the purpose of milk and meat. And I'm saying this from the *perspective* of the cow here, not the human. The phenomenology of the animals we torture very frequently sound like this:\n\nBAD\n\nBAD\n\nBAD\n\nBAD\n\nWORSE\n\nWORSE\n\nWORSE\n\nEVEN WORSE\n\nSO MUCH WORSE\n\nVERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY BAD\n\nAnd so on.\n\nIf anything can be called unethical, it's inflicting this phenomenological state on a being because you \"want something\" from them, and are strong enough to take it, and they cannot speak your language so they can't even protest, but even if they could, it would probably still be simply a matter of [stronger beings dominating weaker beings](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=204) because that's what evolution and the genes are attempting to orient humans and all beings to, but this also means evolution reliably creates beings who are too incompetent to understand ethics-- this is especially true of humans, who sense they can only *be* competent, due to their intelligence. Intelligence has almost nothing to do with understanding fundamental ethics, however. The traits of ethical orientation are the prime determinant of understanding ethics: empathy, a value of the experiences of others, a disposition that does not desire to dominate or express power over one's environment, a desire to be honest, and so on-- None of these necessarily presuppose intelligence, or much of it. But these opposite values, are essentially the trait-sets of Psychopaths, who are essentially beings who are ethically incompetent(but can be perfectly intelligent, even brilliant or geniuses).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":1,"created_utc":1629060468,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h92pqmb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p4rv0f","locked":false,"name":"t1_h92pqmb","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h90tmt3","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/p4rv0f\/what_is_the_best_argument_against_veganism\/h92pqmb\/","retrieved_on":1651670443,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

This is a direct relationship.\n\nThe ideology that humans should \"spread their seed\" or multiply in some form is strongly adopted in many major religions on Earth, either explicitly, or implicitly. Many antinatalists also strongly oppose religion, and link religion to a doctrine or ideology of bringing things, notably humans, into existence(which is done in a way where acquiring consent is impossible-- this is at minimum problematic given the unfortunate nature of the quality of life on Earth).\n\nSo, while Antinatalism isn't quite as strongly linked to atheism as say, philosophical pessimism, Antinatalism does have *some* relationship to antinatalism. I would argue the ideas of antinatalism would be very unlikely in a deeply Abrahamic society.

Racism is an anti-social attitude ultimately, and that's born out of certain anti-social traits(which I think are present in Inmendham generally and it shouldn't surprise anyone if one has seen his content long enough-- Gary really has suffered extremely, and as a result, has created lots of content to expose the farcical and hellish nature of our world, something which seems good, but also unfortunately lacks the wisdom to not let his anger at this circus on Earth not lead him astray and lash out at his fellow human beings or occasionally get the wrong ideas, something that seems to be a negative consequence of all the pain he has endured for the many decades he has been alive while facing very dark ideas and not running away from them).\n\nIntelligence is like... robotic. It's not like wisdom, for example. Intelligence is all the dots of reality and a systematization to acquire those dots. Something like wisdom is actually the connection of those dots, the thing that gives those dots a real richness and meaning. Less abstractly, you can be the greatest genius on planet Earth, while also being a deeply evil human being. There's nothing incompatible with having an IQ of 190 and say, sexually abusing children in a dungeon under one's basement. Being ethical is not what intelligence *is*. Intelligence is like discovering the rules of the game and winning it. Wisdom is discovering if the game is *worth* playing in the first place.\n\nSome of the traits that lead to intelligence involve; logic, problem solving, precision to detail, accuracy, awareness, openness to experience, flexibility, ability to think non-linearly, critical thought, etc. The traits that lead to being ethical involve; empathy, agreeableness, no desire to dominate anyone or thing, values oriented towards honesty, an aversion towards unfairness, an aversion to bias, a concern for what matters with respect to conscious beings who can suffer(this means one *recognizes* that ethics is about beings who suffer or thrive meaningfully, not about rocks or not *quite* about what the tastiest dessert is), etc.\n\nThere is some overlap here. One can \"think critically\" and get to a place of ethical insight. One can \"problem solve\", one can be precise, accurate, aware, open, flexibility certainly helps in not falling for ethical absolutism(ie, Murder is wrong, so killing an ant to save a Human being tortured must be wrong), and so on. But they aren't *necessarily* roads to the same place. \n\nThe intelligence tool-kit really does not always take you to a place of ethics, but if you have the ethical tool-kit it really is almost impossible to be anti-social( as a description of what you are, not necessarily what you end up doing). A psychopath like Ted Bundy with \"agreeableness\" and \"No desire to dominate anyone or thing\" and \"a concern for the wellbeing of others\" and \"deeply valuing honesty\" is just an incoherent concept-- it's just a square circle. And psychopaths are very often intelligent. So we should both ditch this idea that intelligence means ethical understanding, and also the common idea in ethical ideologies(antinatalism, veganism, Utilitarianism, and really any ethical ideology), that people who don't get the ethics which the group does get, are simply stupid. It's not a matter of intelligence. Intelligence is over-rated precisely *because* it fails to get us towards ethics-- otherwise \"homo sapiens\", would be far more ethical than [Lions](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall), but we know [the opposite is true](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629085606,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h945y3s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p4z6yv","locked":false,"name":"t1_h945y3s","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_h92qz2r","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/p4z6yv\/wtf_706_why_is_a_good_question\/h945y3s\/","retrieved_on":1651667353,"score":6,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It's purely because weird mechanics in our brain fail to recognize that actual suffering is taking place. But you can actually expose this farce for yourself, easily, provided you're creative enough. Our brains seem to have no problem enjoying our various privileges. Jeff Bezos certainly must feel like he's on top of the world, in some sense. People far less wealthy, even in low socioeconomic brackets, can feel *amazing* on the right drugs, like cocaine, methamphetamine, and so on. Or they could just be so self-absorbed that one day they're just utterly entertained due to their smartphone showing them the **best** dancing dog video they've *ever* seen. Right?\n\nBut what does it mean to express this in the context of a world where [the murder of Gabriel Fernandez](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez)(NSFL) happens? We have absolutely no problem just whistling to ourselves on the way to the store if we wake up in the proper mood, but it's purely through sheer proximity that we'd say someone was a psychopath if they broke into song while enthusiastically performing [Queen - Don't Stop Me Now](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HgzGwKwLmgM) after we just *transplanted* them as invisible spectators to Gabriel Fernandez's home mid-torture. This would *immediately* give any one of us, who lack the qualifications, the ability to fairly reliably diagnose such a person with some kind of psychopathy.\n\nYet the moment we take arbitrary temporality or distance or geography out of the equation, we're all just fine and mentally healthy. Having the time of our lives. Sure, a child is getting raped right as I am writing(and again, while you are reading-- possibly the same child, possibly not) this post, but we can just ignore that as a fact of our world. It's not *all* bad, right? But... what about the mountain of [sentient beings being eaten alive](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=196)? Or the fact that most human beings don't quite enjoy Jeff Bezos's life, and are in fact either miserable or on antidepressants or using some form of coping mechanism to deal with the trauma of the reality that we certainly appear to be in a pretty hellish world? What about that? That can also be ignored in a variety of sophisticated ways, right? And spun into a narrative that justifies it, and justifies sustaining it rather than at minimum acknowledging the psychopathic circus we have here, right?\n\nNo one is saying this is the *worst* possible hell in principle, unless someone completely lacks creativity, but this is just what human brains do. They justify hellish realities via narratives that are not analogous to reality, because a being that fails to do so, while in a hellish reality, simply does not possess genes that are fit to survive for many generations in such a reality.

The core misunderstanding here, with something like unhealthy and untrue self-criticism is a failure to understand that we do not author who we are.\n\nJust recognize that one fact. You didn't pick the variables that determine who you are. You didn't pick where you were born(The slums? Or a wealthy city?). You didn't pick your genes, and which ones turned on or off, and when. You didn't pick your parents(Were you abused as a child? nourished? grey area? You picked none of it). You didn't pick the events that shaped you in each moment of your life, starting from when you were a toddler(did you have an awful accident? did you have an uneventful life that was simply absent of opportunity? did you have a parent who won the lottery jackpot when you 3?). \n\nThese things are purely unconscious, either because you are quite literally unable to access these variables, or you simply didn't exist to pick these variables. You don't even pick your *thoughts*. This is a surprise maybe, but just observe what happens when you think-- thoughts simply arise from somewhere you *cannot* access in your mind, and you don't know what you'll think 1 second from now.

You can change your mind as much as you want, it doesn't have to be the first bird. Go. Right Now. No more reading. Think of a bird and when you're ready you can read on. Did you think of a bird? If not, just do it. Close your eyes, think of one. Okay. We're continuing. Now why did you not think of a penguin? You know penguins exist, it's not like penguin was 'masked finfoot', a bird you probably didn't know exists. Why not penguin? Hmm? And if it was, why not Owl? You know owls exist. You feel like you could have picked Owl or Penguin, but your neurons at that moment, were going to pick whatever you picked. Right? So what does it mean to say you *could* have picked something else when through sheer physics, you picked what you picked? Who you are, as a person, determines what you picked there. Not some free magical energy you summoned to freely coalesce the thought of a bird. Think about it. And if it confuses you now, return to it some other time.\n\nRecognize that you see some object all of a sudden, and you *react*-- you don't think \"Hmmm, what am I going to think in response to this sight?\" you *simply* think. And even if you could think in that sort of deliberate way, you **still** couldn't account for **how** you ultimately came to the decision you came to. And it's purely due to your own nature, the **way in which you are**, that causes you to think what you think, do what you do.\n\nThis makes self-hatred incoherent, because hatred would only make sense if you could do otherwise. It would be like hating the snow for falling because you don't like the idea of needing to shovel it but you forget that the snow *simply* falls helplessly(imagine the snow is conscious and aware it's falling, but it's still bound to physics like you or me)-- it just makes no sense. The snow can only *be* the snow-- however that manifests. You are not independent of this just because you can make decisions. You can't be ultimately responsible for anything you do-- that's just not the kind of Physics we're operating under. Notice that this also makes hating someone *else* nonsensical-- purely an ethical win.\n\n&gt; You do what you do, in any given situation, because of the way you are. \n\n&gt; To be ultimately responsible for what you do, you have to be ultimately responsible for the way you are—at least in certain crucial mental respects. \n\n&gt; But you cannot be **ultimately** responsible for the way you are in any respect at all. \n\n&gt; So you cannot be ultimately responsible for what you do.\n\n- Galen Strawson, Free Will' --Wikipedia\n\nWhat does this say about learning? You still have to put in effort if you want to get anywhere that you want to get to. If you want to get better at a video game, or get physically fit, or complete a list of books for a year, you must actually move through space(both mental space, and physical space), in a way that navigates that project from starting point, to end point, right? You can't just say \"Well if I'm not ultimately responsible then everything I do is just pointless\" &lt;-- this is a very common, and very deeply confused idea in response to the idea about personal responsibility I just laid out. It's simply not the case that you can just sit around doing nothing and magically become a chess Master. You have to actually engage and put in effort, regardless if you're responsible for whether you succeed or fail in this. This also does not mean \"nothing matters\", just because you're not \"magically free\" in the way you were once confused about. Things matter because ethics has to do with ideas like fairness, the suffering of things that can suffer, and so on. You don't need magical freedom for things to matter. The reason people get depressed over this is they think they *lost* something, but this something, is not a thing they ever had to begin with. They lost nothing-- but they in fact gained so much-- they gained no more hatred(towards one self, or others). Countless mental blocks dissolve once one understands this, but crucially with respect to learning.\n\nSo nothing negative has changed there. You *already* knew you need to put in effort. The only thing that changes is this beating yourself up over failure. It **stops** making sense, because you now understand how reality works better, and can re-orient your attitude to reality. This has benefits because it turns out that trying to succeed at anything while just constantly shitting on yourself, turns out to be counterproductive. Who knew? This is distinct from thinking critically about how to improve-- there's a real malicious and sadomasochistic attitude to the former, that is purely unnecessary, and causes harm and leads to failure. By trying to avoid(and negatively stigmatize) failure, it **causes** failure, ironically.\n\nOn another note, another problem with failing to make progress at something, comes with failing to understand the simple fact that failure itself is crucial to learning. The specific confusion this problem tends to run on is the idea that failure is *bad*. Here's how it starts:\n\nYou're a small child. You do something badly. By definition, this means you've failed somehow, right? And what happens next? Some negative stimulus arrives in a way that cannot be ignored, assuming you've \"failed\" badly enough. Either physical pain, or psychological pain, is in the cards here. Either through your natural environment, or delivered directly by a family member(hitting kids or even being verbally cruel is terrible-- this is the price we pay, you'll see how horribly this leads us astray and causes us to fail to reach our best selves soon).\n\nOkay, and then what? Then we don't do that thing. We learned that fire, is bad, it turns out. We learned that sometimes the drink is too hot to drink, and it hurts. Or that the sharp thing can be deeply unpleasant. Or that bumping into things also hurts. Or that breaking the human social norm really makes us feel bad, either due to the act, or due to the consequences of the act. This happens to use endlessly in our developing and formative years. And the conditioning lesson here, is simply thus:\n\n&gt; Failure is **bad**.\n\nThis is what gets drilled into our brains. Now, the above can sometimes be true. Failure *can* be bad, yes. The worst way to fail seems to be ethically. If words mean anything, then failing ethically is 'bad'. Failing to maintain our health and wellbeing, is also bad for us, personally. But when it comes to learning a skill or developing ourselves as people, failure should not be thought of as bad. This conditioning we've received is causes harm-- firstly because it's **untrue**. Failure is crucial to learning anything. You must make mistakes to understand that the action that was just performed is wrong or could be better, right? Improvement makes zero sense in any other context. Anyone who has ever improved at anything has failed. That happened as a progression, through failure, even if they reached some height of greatness, they were failing somehow, and either improving or reaching their peak. But only a re-orientation towards seeing failure as perfectly normal, as an opportunity to learn, makes sense when you're learning something. See what happens. Instead of that immediate knee jerk reaction next time you fail, just try to look at it as an opportunity to see what could be done better next time. This isn't some \"think happy thoughts\" nonsense while a shark is gnawing your foot off. You're not deceiving yourself in any way. It's simply a **fact** that you must fail to make progress in any skill or endeavor. It's simply a **fact** that self-hatred is a completely incoherent idea.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629099097,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h94pmyx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p58x7v","locked":false,"name":"t1_h94pmyx","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p58x7v","permalink":"\/r\/overcoming\/comments\/p58x7v\/how_do_i_stop_myself_from_feeling_like_i_should\/h94pmyx\/","retrieved_on":1651666246,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"overcoming","subreddit_id":"t5_r1ll3","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/overcoming","subreddit_type":"restricted","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I don't think this is a \"you\" problem, but rather I think this is just the nature of things, to one degree or another. Some people have things really, really, really, really bad. Others have it better. But no one really... has it *good*, truly *good*. We're not in that world, I don't think, but our brains can sometimes tell us otherwise. They can insist that everyone besides us, has it better. It's obvious-- just look at social media, or look at that person who we envy because they have x y z thing we don't have. This is just what the human brain *does*-- it's constantly not satisfied. It does this for a specific reason I'll get to. It *doesn't* do this because this is reality. You don't see reality, you see a narrative your brain is predisposed to see.\n\nWe know this, actually, this isn't speculation. We know it *so* well, that we can reliably predict that if you got informed that you'd be awarded a million dollars every year for the rest of your life, starting *tomorrow*, your happiness and life satisfaction would reach a certain high threshold, and then that *feeling*, would fade, believe it or not. It would get duller, and duller, and duller, until it's not quite the same anymore. By then, we're used to our yearly million. It's just normal for us. That first million made us feel like a million bucks, but the 24th million? Eh. To be expected by now. \n\nSure, I guess we're lucky. I guess it wasn't always like this. But that kind of self-awareness will generally be eclipsed by some thought that sounds like: \n\n&gt; \"Man... all the billionaires have it so good. It's such an unfair world. This life sucks.\" \n\nI guarantee you this is what almost every single human on Earth, would think in some sense, to some degree. We just can't see it, because we're too stuck in our current perspective. That's what the human brain does.\n\nAnd you can know this even without this fantasy scenario occurring, because you know *precisely* the feeling of something good happening in your life. **Surely** something you'd call \"deeply good\" has happened, no? Some best day. Some great luck. Something. Something like that has happened to you, certainly. And that happiness from it, where did it go? It just tapered off, just like the millions of dollars would. \n\nEverything functions this way, and the technical term for this is the hedonic treadmill. It produces a kind of illusion that causes us to fail to appreciate things worth appreciating for very long. Why? Because beings who didn't have this, simply were happy. They were content. And in the evolutionary game of go-getters and early birds getting worms and competition and some other very unsavory elements in evolutionary history, the people who were *unhappy*, got to \"win\". \n\nYou'd think the reward would go to the people who were like, \"You know what everyone? Food is abundant. We have shelter. We have community. What more could we need?\" Turns out, nope. Evolution doesn't actually care about rewarding that. Not to depress you further, but evolution would rather reward the people who came in and burned that place down, killed everyone, felt happy as a result(for whatever narrative they were operating under, perhaps \"We're better\" or something that reduces to that), and then that happiness went down and they went to go look for some other thing to exploit to get happy. If they were *just* happy, then they'd be out-competed by the next group who wasn't, and had some itch or motivator to do *more*. *Better*. *Improve*. *Not content*. *Not good enough*. *Need extra... thing...*.\n\nWe're the product of that. That's the bad news. But the good news is, you can realize that this is a bug, not a feature(yes, it's a feature in evolutionary contexts, but we don't care, right? We're just trying to be in touch with reality). The fact is, there are things to recognize right now that override this bug. You don't have to be brimming with joy every day, you don't have to lie to yourself to fabricate anything, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm only saying is, don't *confuse* yourself needlessly in the way the brain tends to orient itself towards, by constantly spiraling into thoughts about regret, dissatisfaction, worry about futures that have not yet occurred, insecurity about one's own abilities, and so on. There are things to appreciate right now, but the brain is reliably confused because it only cares about helping us win evolutionary games, which are kind of bullshit, right?","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629100736,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h94rn0s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p49zx3","locked":false,"name":"t1_h94rn0s","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p49zx3","permalink":"\/r\/overcoming\/comments\/p49zx3\/advice_on_doing_things_with_no_mental_energy\/h94rn0s\/","retrieved_on":1651666097,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"overcoming","subreddit_id":"t5_r1ll3","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/overcoming","subreddit_type":"restricted","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

The same logic would dictate that to reduce deforestation, we should just prevent trees from growing in the first place. \n\nYeah, and I'm saying the crucial element that's missing for your analogy to work is what a concern for cutting down a tree looks like versus bringing a child into an awful life, in ethical terms. There's nothing about cutting down a tree that is meaningfully unethical in isolation(unless we're all truly confused about tree consciousness\/sentience, and they have robust inner realities of real pain and wellbeing-- there is no strong evidence whatsoever to suggest this as far as I know). There's *something* about creating a being through nothing other than our sheer egocentrism, and bringing them into a world where they are guaranteed to suffer.\n\nIf you're speaking of large scale\/scope consequences, like deforestation here (analogous to something bad happening if people don't continually increase the population), then I would actually challenge your analogy on the idea that deforestation is bad wholesale(I already explained to you how-- ending the nightmare of predatory animals once forests die is an ethical victory). \n\nThe point of the unsavory conclusion: This is all *just* based on human egomania, and it should stop, because the costs to sustain this world, whether in terms of [human-human](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez), [animal-animal](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PcnH_TOqi3I), and [human-animal](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg) dynamics, are an ethical horror show. No amount of petting dogs with wagging tails and joy is worth this. Not even an entire galaxy of bliss, is worth the 3 torture scenarios I just presented, and only someone who is either deeply ethically confused in a way that made them appear like a psychopath, or a *genuine* psychopath, would relish in their own personal joys, or the fact that joy exists, to justify only these *three* scenarios.\n\nNow the reality is, the quantity of misery on our planet, historically, and at this moment(Perhaps you forgot, but I'll remind you: Children are raped on a daily basis.

It's obvious to me that we should just call the human species broken instead of being permanently locked in pots calling kettles black. Every where you look in history and in modern terms, you could sample the full range of skin colors, and you will find a psychopathic species-- reliably. We then aren't honest in saying \"Oh okay, it turns out the species is evil\", but rather we invent political narratives to explain this. \"Oh, it's actually *this group* that are the [baddies](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8JOpPNra4bw).\" No, the big plot twist of this movie on Earth is our species is broken.\n\n\nSo this fixation we have on skin color, is purely a fantasy within that psychopathic context, where we try to play these dominance games with each other and say: \"X group is bad, Y group is the better group. Hmm? Oh yes, it's true that I happen to belong to and identify with Y group.\" This is how the monkey brain works, it's just that simple. The only way to win such a game is to not play it at all, and address the elephant in the room: A mentally ill species, who became so, **due** to the evolution *rewarding* insanity over sanity. It rewards division. It rewards this political dominance game. That's our predicament right now. Evolution made us anti-social in a variety of, sometimes *very* complex and subtle, ways and this is actually considered \"winning\" in evolutionary terms. All we can really do is avoid these insane games that humans play and recognize their banality and stop feeding into it. \n\n&gt; I think of intelligence as an appreciation for reality, and as a way of thinking with efficiency.\n\nYes, exactly, that's what I think intelligence is too, I just think \"an appreciation of reality\" has an implication: It means that a being is oriented to actually get the information required to appreciate reality.\n\n&gt; An intelligent person can be a racist, but the ideas and tenets of racism would be so offensive to their intelligence, they'd keep their racism a visceral reaction, like the way you just like cookies and cream ice cream, because of silly preference that has no formal basis. To have involved serious discourse on racism, and to start believing in the trite, demonstrates a marked deficiency in intelligence, at least partially. \n\nAh okay, so for me the crucial distinction you're identifying is self-awareness, not necessarily intelligence. We're *really* splitting hairs when we discuss this by the way because there are countless people who are exactly as you describe: Intelligent enough to discover that having logical consistency is crucial, and therefore recognize how arbitrary it is that they \"dislike\" something(or someone) and recognize this project as lacking anything meaningful. That realization alone can sometimes be enough to lead one to not be racist. But the actual crucial variable... and the brain really is a strange tool, let's remember. It suffers cognitive dissonance, something compatible with high intelligence. It can be intelligent and failing in just the right crucial respects towards certain realizations. It could be the *best* thing at doing calculus on planet Earth, and *still* think a thought like: \"Wow, &lt;x race&gt; really are just subhumans.\" It could be a leading expert in Biology, and *still* think: \"The bible really was authored by the creator of the universe, and is the ultimate infallible truth of a perfect and all powerful being who loves us.\" That's how nimble and buggy our brains actually are.\n\nAnd I'm saying the real crucial variable to stopping those things, are *other* trait orientations. A certain *kind* of person, no matter how smart or not so smart, will fail to discover themselves operating under those beliefs. If intelligence was the key, we'd see a very straightforward, beautiful mathematical curve between racism and dumb people, and the smarter everyone got, racism just vanished. Or beliefs in superstitious ancient stupidity vanished. But that's not *quite* what we see. There are plenty of low intelligence people who are simply *not* racist. They are kind people. They don't *need* intelligence to not be racist. There are people of utterly average or slightly above average IQ who can say: \"Yup, the idea that a God wrote this book sounds... like not the best explanation.\" There's something *more* to it. Other traits. Yes, intelligence *overlaps* with these variables, so it's reeaaaaallly hard to get to the nitty gritty of it all-- this is why I used the term \"splitting hairs\". We really need to bust out the magnifying glass to discover what's true here.\n\n&gt; I think the way you have described intelligence, is more like intellect. For example, the way a spider weaves it web, seems extremely intelligent, but that's not intelligence it is intellect, and skillset, ability. Humans have great intellect, it's like the difference between a mere calculator and a modern computer. The calculator could have more intelligent software, superior to the computer, but because the hardware is better, the computer is able to dominate the calculator. In the same way, I often entertain the idea that perhaps dogs and cats are more intelligent that we are, that perhaps if their software was able to run on our hardware they'd make far better use of it; but that's just something I find interesting to think about.\n\nDefinitely, I entertain these sorts of thoughts about animals as well. It's like that meme where the the ignorant person is enjoying the birds chirping, but they're actually discussing something of profound importance, making an idiot of the person. Huge fan of that meme, that's probably in some sense what our ignorance looks like to outsiders, if they could fully appreciate our ignorance. If aliens could study all of our thoughts, that's *how* stupid we'd look, to them. So that meme isn't really a fictional idea as far as I'm concerned, that's reality, whether or not the birds can express rich ideas or not( I'm guessing sparrows can't, for example).\n\nBut re: your spider, I don't think the spider weaving a web necessarily possesses significant intelligence or intellect. Clearly there's at least *some* intelligence, it's not zero, right? It doesn't have the IQ of a carrot. *Something* is there. But it's not meaningful in the scope of intelligence, both in principle(Earth right now) and in practice(Everything that is possible within the laws of physics). We wouldn't say the spider is \"intellectual\", that means a certain thing too, right? \"Intellectuals\" mean specific kinds of intelligent people. One could be very highly intelligent, as some kind of autistic savant, and obsess over trains. Just spend 80 years utterly sperging out and mastering everything with respect to trains. The trains of the world. The history of trains. They'd have toy trains. Just trains, 24\/7, perfect efficiency, incredible breadth of highly precise knowledge, innovations in the field of train-specific transportation, and so on. We wouldn't call that person an \"intellectual\" though. A intellectual is something *more*. Obviously again we're just really being extra precise on semantics, the precise meanings of words, but here's the plain English description of intelligence I used: There's the dots of reality, and the ability to acquire those dots, and then there's the connection of those dots. It's that first part of dot acquisition we strongly associate with intelligence, and then clearly some connection is necessarily, and some putting into practice is necessary.\n\nThis is why the spider has neither significant intelligence or intellect, and this is why the racist can have 190 IQ and still lack the awareness to discover \"Wow, what I said just made no sense ethically\".

But I don't think the \"price\" argument too terribly applicable to the 3rd world( I could be wrong, I'm not from a very impoverished country). It's almost certainly cheaper to vegan than an omnivore in less economically robust countries. I know that veganism in South India(Far from a case of extreme poverty, even though obviously poverty is significant in India) is widespread, and it costs cents to eat a huge variety of lentil and rice based foods and meet nutritional needs for the day. If I had to guess, I would imagine that it could actually be *easier* to be a vegan in South India than in Los Angeles or London, this includes correcting for income and the currencies, etc.\n\nSo the price argument(both that it's cheap to be vegan, and that it's too expensive to be vegan) shouldn't be what we're focusing on, although there's some variety\/disparity here.

If A is true, and B is true, veganism is simply indisputably true.\n\nThe problem with the veganism debate is our emotions. We can't disconnect a bias towards things like meat\/diary, and the actual ethics at hand. So we get awful arguments against veganism. Likewise with vegans, they often cannot disconnect their disgust at the thought of eating meat or someone who does, with the real world scenario we're in when it comes to how our actions actually impact the world ethically.

I think we are *clearly* messing with conscious lives, that is not up for debate. We know these animals suffer and cry and so on. They happen to not speak English, but if they could, we'd be mortified and basically be exposed as completely callous monsters.\n\n&gt; The point I am losing your analogy is that we are not analogous to the aliens here. Nature is not a generator that we created.\n\nThat's a distinction here, but it's not a meaningful distinction for the ethics here-- because the fact remains that both the aliens, and humans, can actually **do something** to change the ethical nightmare we're looking at. We can admit: \"This **is** a nightmare, this is wrong. Stop bringing things into existence pointlessly, or for frivolous reasons, or just because \"The DNA wants to replicate.\" Ethical salience exists at the level of conscious beings, and the only thing that keeps this mess going on, and on, and on, and on... is the DNA. \n\n&gt; My point is that, in farming, we are creating a space within nature for the farmed animals that is better than what nature gives them (assuming a responsible and humane farm). Am I understanding your point?\n\nYeah, well first I'd dispute that we are doing such a thing-- I would bet most animal agriculture is a hellworld, unfortunately, if you close your eyes for a few seconds and just imagine that just under a hundred *billion* animals are killed(and prior to being killed, are [tortured](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3229) every 365 days. This does not include everything being constantly torn to pieces and slowly dying in pain in the wild. Constantly in fear of predators. Constantly in pain from parasites. Yes, I grant your point-- it is possible to have a very dramatically different scenario between the best animal agriculture on Earth, and the worst, but the **norm** is the worst-- the best is rather a fantasy scenario that is an outlier. Most animals are clearly depressed and living *nowhere* near their peak wellbeing, just like we would be if we were exploited like lives(perhaps we are, in some sense, but that's another can of worms).\n\nSo the trade we perform is we take animals out of one hell(which, by the way, there's **zero** chance there would be as many pigs and cows globally if humans didn't eat them-- these animal populations would be **small**, we absolutely make the problem worse by **scaling** it to immense proportions to satisfy the global human population), and put them inside a new hell.

I think we're implying ethics into \"Understanding the universe\"-- we're not talking about understanding how the electrons are arranged in an asteroid 400 light years away in some lifeless middle-of-nowhere in the universe, right? Surely we agree. We're speaking in fact about *meaningfully* understanding the universe, and this means ethically. Sure, we want to understand physics, but there are really trivial understandings and and deeply meaningful understandings, it's that second part we care about.\n\nThat narrative of \"truly understanding\", at this moment, seems worrying, in the absolute **best** case scenario. If we lose some naivete and optimism here, and instead sober ourselves towards hyper-seriousness and precision, and shift optimistic bias towards purely a concern for realism, we get quite an... unpalatable... ethically problematic, picture of the world. If we can admit this alone, we will have made progress I think. Perhaps I'm wrong, but this *says something* about happiness, and making others happy. Perhaps this is purely semantic and once we hash out meanings of words, then we're just all like \"Oh of *course*, yes\"-- but speaking of happiness seems hedonistic, and once again, the question is begged: What does it mean to be happy in *our* universe? The concern here is while it's both easy to be happy and confused, and miserable and confused, they're distinct in a crucially ethical sense because the second one really seems closer to being right by accident.\n\n9:00 Is especially interesting to me. One can look at the fine grained mechanics of boredom, and look externally, and create a theory of how we're stimulated, but the fact remains that there are dramatically different ways to approach boredom. Boredom is a kind of attention pathology. It's a lack of awareness to recognize that *stimulation* is not the most meaningful fact of existence. Stimulation alone is in fact, meaningless(ethically). To realize this with total lucidity at any point while within a state of boredom, makes boredom instantly dissolve. \n\nWhat does it *mean* to be bored when one can intuit what actually occurs on Earth? All the heights of human experience occurring, all the strokes of luck, all the suffering, all the strangeness, both of the identifiable universe, and of the fact of existing at all? This is why all boredom is pure confusion with respect to the fact of existence. It's a kind of egocentric orientation towards seeking stimulus because that's what happened to be evolutionary advantageous.\n\nJust imagine how this plays out. Imagine a tribe of proto-humans that were simply *never* bored. That had a simple life. They weren't starving. They had shelter. The basics. They were *not* bored-- their brains didn't orient them this way(let's say genes, or culture, produced this trait-- does not matter). Now what does this mean in comparison to another tribe who *did* get bored? Who *did* get that nagging feeling: \"*This* state here? This is not enough. I need *more*. Now, is *bad*. The plainness of *this*, is undesirable and bothersome. If there's a stimulation on offer, I'll take it!\"\n\nThis opens the door for all manner of domineering behavior. Even *war* is a potential cure to boredom. But *certainly* looking for more food than one needs. Certainly sex. Certainly a frivolous fighting. Notice how *any* form of proactive behavior, even if it's utterly foolish, or pointless, or dangerous(but clearly if it's beneficial) has a potential evolutionary advantage. The genes can be thought to have a Nike sponsorship: \"Just do it\". That's how we're oriented as humans, and how our ancestors, the winners were(the losers, to some degree, were **not**).\n\nBut this says nothing about the rationality behind boredom. It doesn't even say boredom is a *valid* mindstate, it's purely an arbitrary evolutionary disposition which we can now attempt to make sense of. And I would argue, that boredom is a purely irrational emotion which we should not treat as a meaningful problem to feed into in some narrow sense(Cocaine is not the cure to boredom, even though it may seem to be on paper-- not even *stimulation* itself is the cure, because taking the pathology seriously *itself* is the \"meta-disease\"), but rather reconsider completely what the emotion even *means* and what it says about our species before we get too fine-grained in trying to explain it. It's possible for us to get too zoomed into the \"harmonics of trees\" without realizing a much greater truth about the nature of the \"forest\". *Even* when our theories are creative and technically true.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629184628,"distinguished":null,"edited":1629226598.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h99gdrl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p5yl5p","locked":false,"name":"t1_h99gdrl","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p5yl5p","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/p5yl5p\/consciousness_hacking_quantifying_bliss_andrés\/h99gdrl\/","retrieved_on":1651656251,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I think Efilism specifically identifies the root of ethical relevance as the *mechanics* which lead to life, or sentient\/conscious beings. Because this is the substrate above which suffering rests. So on Earth, this would be DNA. It *could* be something else on other planets, but as far as we know now, if the replication of DNA stops, and nothing like it ever stops up again, you've perfectly averted hell in our world, in so far as nothing else exists or emerges in our universe(a big leap, actually).\n\nYou can imagine this on an Earth scale(engineering the ceasing of DNA replication-- which **does not mean** \"Just murdering everyone\" and it's not actually only to due with the ethics around murder, but because this would be a very foolish way to make things far worse-- this is *worse* than failure because it only risks engineering \"Super life\") or a universe scale, but the point is this: It would be as *if* you were God, who performed a veto towards hell now, and all possibility of hell, in the future. It would be a heroic move if this could be done as far as I can see, but it **could** be wrong, as well, if we're ignorant of things like Many Worlds, or we're ignorant of some larger nature outside of our universe(this has philosophical problems to worry about obviously because we can't ever go \"outside\" of our universe-- whatever that would be, would be inside, by definition. And we probably can't hope for \"escaping the simulation\" if such a thing is operative).\n\nSo Efilism to me is just like any other ethical position, that tries to identify the ethical bullseye. The \"ism\" of 'Negative-Utilitarianism', tries to paint that bullseye on suffering\/negative utility. Efilism paints that bullseye on the mechanics which **produce** beings who have *some* relationship to suffering\/negative utility(both in practice and in principle). Virtually all other problems which NU faces, Efilism also faces, but these problems and their solutions appear different because of the *slight* difference towards where they see the \"core problem\" is. Hopefully by comparing Efilism to NU, it's more clear how we can potentially define Efilism in a more simple and straightforward way.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629235327,"distinguished":null,"edited":1629235773.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9c4hkq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p697ct","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9c4hkq","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_p697ct","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/p697ct\/definition_of_efilism\/h9c4hkq\/","retrieved_on":1651650668,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Yep, I've heard a lot of this too but male-oriented. It really seems like there's some kind of psychology here around shame. They can't feel shame(like psychopaths), but they have this like.... black hole of intensely concentrated shame, buried deep inside them. And the way they deal with this shame of theirs, is they find a victim to offload it onto. So then they can seem to feel more at peace. It's almost ritualistic to them. Amazing once you understand the mechanics behind it-- they're just this evil, confused robot. Broken brain, no cure, and guaranteed to cause human misery(and be miserable). I wouldn't wish this condition on anyone, because it means at minimum one person will be suffering(the Narcissist themselves), but almost certainly more.\n\nThe fact that you managed to get away is truly priceless, so congrats there. The above is more or less my method for not suffering. I think it's not understanding that feeds into a lot of suffering. We're forced to invent narratives, and doubts; \"Is my parent just evil? Are they all like this? Am I really the one at fault?\" But once you understand the total mechanics, the psychology, how all the gears work, and why they work that way(evolutionary adaptations and strategies for survival that have no rhyme or reason, just attempts-- full of bugs), then much of the weight of the pain and damage can actually get lifted off of us. \n\nThis is because when I understand it's just a robot, running on a program, and not a person who can feel shame, guilt, behave ethically, I can no longer hate them. Right? It just doesn't make sense. It would be like hating a shark that bit you, severely and permanently damaging your leg. That's just what sharks *do*. Yes, your pain is still real. It doesn't make what happened okay, clearly-- but the *hatred* of the thing that caused your misfortune-- that no longer makes sense, and that resentment actually generates a *shocking* amount of lasting trauma.

Too many conversations I've tried to engage with people in regarding the Holy Spirit, and almost every time Satan seems to take hold of them and they are unable to respond to any of my questions.

I've been very detached from my family the past few days thinking they could possibly just be in league with Satan and I've been pondering for too long that every sinner is Satan's puppet until I, as a part of God's special mission for me, bathe them in the light of the Holy Spirit.

This problem is particularly\nacute when the victims are males. Sexual assaults upon boys are less likely to be reported than are those\nupon girls. 99 It is unclear, however, what the ratio of abused girls and boys is. Some say it is as much as\n9 : 1, while others say that girls are abused at only a slightly higher rate than boys. (100) Adult males are\nalso less likely than women to report being sexually assaulted. (101) The under-reporting of sexual assault\non males and the resultant misperception of the ratio of male to female victims may partially explain\nwhy people are less sympathetic to male victims. Because the phenomenon is less in the public\nconsciousness it is less likely to be taken seriously. However, the reverse causal relationship is arguably\ngreater: sexual assault on males is less likely to be reported in part because people are less likely to\nbelieve the report. There are other reasons too. Some of these have to do with the male gender role and\nthese will be discussed in the next chapter.|\n\n-- Benatar\n\n*99 - Almost every scholar working in the area makes this claim.

I wrote a lengthy post before this post was deleted and reposted, but I think this time I'll simply say that understanding the mechanics of what makes something aesthetically pleasing to us may be interesting, but the more important question may be prior to that endeavor. Making people happy is generally good, but making people happy in a way that may not be meaningful, I think, is bad. \n\nThere's an assumption floating around somewhere(Not saying the content creator here has this assumption, I cannot know) that *all* happiness is meaningful, or that certain large gradations of happiness contexts are-- this is where I think we need to focus, and get super precise on what meaningful positive states of mind mean. I think the key to doing this is by asking what experiencing these states *mean* about the person experiencing them. Ie, What does it *mean* when a mother is zonked out on some totally dissociative bliss cocktail of MDMA, Ketamine, Heroin(ignore any contraindications here, this isn't supposed to be literally pharmacologically practical), while her child is raped by a psychopath near by? What happens when we play with distance, and now place the child on the other side of the globe, and live stream this to her, and she's unmoved in her bliss state? What if we simplify the relationship to a human understanding that a fellow human is getting tortured? And now scale this fact upwards?\n\nNow all we need to entertain is these states are *roughly* possible without any drugs(albeit more subtly, in a way that we need to pay precise and careful attention to discover), purely through a person's traits, dispositions, orientations, beliefs. ie \"I believe ethics is a human fabrication, containing no meaning\" and \"I believe hedonism *really* is where it's at... that's what **really** gets me going. No high hedonic state is a **huge** bummer!\" and so on. These are expressions of our traits, as humans oriented to compete in the DNA game. **Not** to orient us to reality **or** to ethics-- remember. But to compete and win a very narrow and specific game. Hedonism has *some* relationship to this game, in practice and in principle. So we must analyze what this means, what this **says** about us as individuals and as a species, given the context of our world(Which is provoked by the questions: What tends to *happen* here on Earth, in ethically relevant terms? What clues does our response or failure to respond tell us?).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629249412,"distinguished":null,"edited":1629249860.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9cxfdf","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p5ymy3","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9cxfdf","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p5ymy3","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/p5ymy3\/consciousness_hacking_quantifying_bliss_andrés\/h9cxfdf\/","retrieved_on":1651648970,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I think revenge is a deeply human behavior. We evolved this for the same reason we evolved altruism-- to reciprocate like with like. However, I don't think, ultimately, that it's a good strategy ethically. This is like the ancient idea, \"eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth\". This is what we consider \"fair\". But if you just examine certain facts about our existence, this idea stops making sense. The crucial fact here is that no one makes themselves. Even bad people. No one sits there, prior to being born, and goes \"Yup, I'll take the severe child abuse and sociopath genetics, please! I'll get brutally tortured as a child, causing me to harm small animals first, then bully other children, then end up being an utterly sadistic human as an adult.\"\n\nPeople are just *unlucky* to discover themselves in these conditions in the same way that being born into wealth or poverty is a coin flip which no one chooses. The facts of who **you are**, can't be accounted for. You feel like it can, you feel like \"I can choose to be a good person, or a bad person\", but that feeling is kind of fictional, if you really examine it carefully. All you can be is whoever you happen to be. If you're a good person, you'll **helplessly** be good. If you did something evil as a good person, that would be like... some kind of psychotic, deranged episode, for you. We'd need a good explanation. That's not you just switching it up for fun. And if it was, that *too* says something about who you are. This is simply how genes, the brain, and causality works. We still have to try to do good, it won't just come about if we lay on the floor all day-- but whatever *does* come of our efforts is not \"freely chosen\" by us-- that is a fictional idea.\n\nWhat does this have to do with revenge? Revenge is a kind of punishment or semblance of \"justice\", a justice which I would say doesn't really exist. There's no \"making up for\" crimes once they occur-- that idea is a fantasy too, and even if it was true, it absolutely doesn't make sense to \"punish\" someone who was doomed to commit their crime. How meaningful is such a punishment? It's like punishing a dog with beatings because it didn't go \"Mooooooo\" like a cow, or punishing a monkey because it can't do complex math. It's totally incoherent, and sadistic, and says something about us as human beings.\n\nOnce I understood this, any idea of revenge that occurred to me was recognized as sheer confusion on my part.

Needless to say that there's a huge amount of people that are completely ignorant to the dangers around us.\n\nI think ignorance is different from running away. One can't run from something they aren't truly aware of. The way the system *could* game human beings is by destroying awareness(and perhaps other senses-- smell, sight, hearing). Then the system can profit by offering cures. The system therefore is incentivized to create problems via their past endeavors(wars, experiments, dangerous products, etc), and then create solutions, which are always then used as profit. This endlessly perpetuates exploitation and domination.\n\nSimply stating this problem and bringing it to awareness is *not* a solution to the problem, nor is it some kind of \"civil responsibility\", because the sort of domination that exists on the top of the human pyramid cannot be fought in roughly the same way that [wildebeasts are powerless](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall) when the lions are simply better adapted to play and win dominance games. At the human level, the problem is *exponentially* worse. \n\nAll we can do is speak of how to lose less. We are the wildebeast. We can't win. What strategies do we have in the context of losing? Some of these will be better, worse. Some more efficient, some less. Some will seem good in the short term, but will play out badly in the long term, and vice versa. This is the **only** game that exists.\n\nPart of the invisible chain of one's slavery is the narrative that good beats evil(notice how all fiction repeats this same story? this is not an accident-- this is ancient slave memetics)-- to be less of a slave, one must overcome this idea, and then the real game is revealed.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629272350,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9dwinm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p62r1n","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9dwinm","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p62r1n","permalink":"\/r\/C_S_T\/comments\/p62r1n\/the_protection_of_knowledge_how_society_works_and\/h9dwinm\/","retrieved_on":1651646889,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"C_S_T","subreddit_id":"t5_37lis","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/C_S_T","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I've never taken DMT which Andres mentions, so I could be speaking with the same level of ignorance someone speaks of when one speaks from total psychedelic naivete, but I've always thought of this in a way that doesn't exclude this question to drug-induced experience only. So a real big picture sense here includes schizophrenia, includes marijuana, LSD, tea, includes a panic attack while totally sober in an otherwise \"healthy\/neurotypical\" individual, includes serious trauma to the brain(both psychological, and physical), etc.\n\nAnd the conception I've used personally has been the analogy of a slot machine. We can get to reality in at least two distinct ways. One is what I call roughly pragmatic strategies. These are science values, these are detail orientation values and memes(You can't get an ought from an is! Only **is**-- details, are allowed!). The other way in this dichotomy is the opposite values orientation-- idealistic strategies. These are strategies that reveal **huge** patterns. This value orientation says \"Eh, the details can be a little fuzzy here or there, we care about the rich, vibrant pattern. We want the big picture. We want the forest, the trees don't matter as much.\" \n\nThe slot machine is sort of like the second strategy--- it's \"gambling\". When one smokes marijuana, or has a psychotic episode as a schizophrenic, the odds of this mapping onto reality are low. But there's no rule in physics or biology or any other relevant field that says \"A schizophrenic\/someone deeply under the influence of marijuana cannot discover something utterly profound\". These high entropy pattern focused states are a pattern orientation that simply does not care about the precision of details(this explains the cliche of a high person writing down their mindblowing epiphany, only to discover it is nonsense after sobering), only the rich patterns captivate experience. Meanwhile, the phenomenology of autism seems very often to be \"pattern dense\"-- able to see A, B, C, with incredible precision and accuracy, but *unable* to link A-&gt;B-&gt;C without some sort of rule-based, rigid, robotic(this is often a pejorative descriptor of a person on the spectrum), systematization scheme.\n\nThese two systems are not mutually exclusive, we operate on *both* of these orientations to some degree. But when we go strongly in one direction while lacking the other, we call these conditions \"pathological\", they seem too fixated on an imbalanced approach to reality.\n\nI would argue that this assumption is similar to the assumption that drugs like psychedelics or states of intropectrion\/training cannot produce genuine insight(clearly untrue), and we should incorporate all of this into a big picture conception of what is going on at the genetic level(concerned with a specific superficial 'winning') and at a values oriented level(What is true? What is ethical? -- Things genes do not generally care about unless they directly produce 'winning'-- this is why humans have not solved suffering for all of these eons, but rather made it worse. Suffering is a problem for humans, but it is a *strategy* for genes.). \n\nThe reason this is useful to the genes should be obvious: Reality is not a kind place, if we glance at history. In a not-kind place, evolution will reward beings who are not in touch with reality. Evolution is trying to min-max just the *right* kind of psychosis-resulting strategy that \"wins\". All of what we'd call, as much as I'm not fond of the term, \"disorders\"(Autism, schizophrenia), and drug-induced states, and simply baseline neurotypical human(and animal) experience, is generally psychotic and not in touch with reality as a form of adaptive survival. This is what we should expect once we grant reality is not kind, and this explains the prevalence of religions, cults, cognitive bias like wishful thinking, self-serving bias, and especially optimism bias, and crucially explains the prevalence of something like schizophrenia which is purely pathological pattern-generation(more ways to be wrong about reality than right-- create a wrong pattern = better odds of survival in a hellish world), all the other flavors of the mind evolution has produced, none of which are \"reality-oriented\"(although some much better than others). The genes are concerned with all of these trade-offs, and are just attempting strategies.\n\nThe reason this is useful to questions of values(what is true, what is ethical?) is because we may be too hasty in judging that the pragmatic approach is alwats best. Our world is *generally* biased in favor of pragmatism. We run on science. On laws. On heuristics. On \"what works\"(indeed, this is what 'pragmatic' *literally* means). We also therefore dismiss the opposite value system. The \"Slot machine\". Schizophrenics are ostracized. The psychedelic experience is dismissed. We see the odds are bad. Bad odds, means bad system, right? Well... yes actually, in many ways playing the lottery to make a million dollars *is* a terrible strategy. But this is not precisely what's going on when we're asking \"How do we discover things worth discovering?\" It could be that the pragmatic approach is just *too slow*. Or that it is poisoned by our bias or DNA's propensity to hijack our interests via it's own domination interests( Science\/pragmatism is used to develop torture techniques, surveillance, chemical and bio weapons, and atomic bombs-- things of no direct value to the project of \"What is true\/what is ethical\").\n\nThe pragmatic approach is just \"Much absence of knowing, low chance of profundity, but highly accurate and precise small pocket of systematized knowledge which fits coherently together while being open to, but difficult to, change\". The price the pragmatic approach pays is a ) Very slow. Takes hundreds, or thousands of years to get anything done. b) It could be *dead wrong* with just one crucial fact of reality to change **everything**.(imagine some discovery in physics that absolutely dwarfs every other discovery a trillionfold in its profundity).\n\nThe idealistic approach is just \"Much false knowledge, *higher* but still low chance of potentially **astronomical** profundity, but highly imprecise and inaccurate entropic slot-machining.\" The price it pays is a) Also very slow, but you *can* win big if immensely lucky, but you can also be **immensely** unlucky. b) It's so *easy* to be dead wrong compared to the pragmatic approach.\n\nThe generally unappreciated upside of the second approach over the former is that you can discover something with the idealistic approach that could in principle take a million years of rigid pragmatism. That's an attractive prospect, no matter the odds, given the costs to pull the lever are not extreme. I think as long as we recognize these tradeoffs, we can stop pretending like there's only one valid way to approach discovering insights about reality, as long as we're honest about the pros and cons and recognize the role of the genes here(while occasionally overlapping)-- generally divergent from our values(What is true? What is ethical?).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629276146,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9e0iu6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p6la99","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9e0iu6","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p6la99","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/p6la99\/high_entropy_alloys_of_experience_andrés_gómez\/h9e0iu6\/","retrieved_on":1651646679,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I think these terms cause more confusion than the utility(there is *some*, but it should be generally re-thought and discarded purely semantically) in delineating between descriptions of the way things work, and the way things work in those terms in practice.\n\n\"Sure, that may all be speaking of *physics*, but that's actually *meta-physics*! The fantasy realm! Physics is the descriptive realm of facts!\"\n\n\"Sure, that may all make sense in the terminology of *ethics*, but that's actually *meta-ethics*! You can't get an ought from an is!\/Ethics is merely a human invention!\"\n\nAll of the above is confused. Objective reality contains \n\n* physics - a description of how ontological reality plays out and functions in terms of particle\/reality substrate behavior  \n\nand \n\n* ethics - a description of how ontological reality plays out and functions in terms of conscious beings and their various states that relate to their wellbeing\/suffering and the way this colors the physical and mental nature of that reality-- ie, \"Are we in hell?\"(&lt;-- Not subjective. Hell is a *place* that is a configuration of particles which contain conscious beings. Hells which are empty of subjects exist in principle and likely in practice.)\n\nTo be clear, I don't think physics departments should generally be working to tell us things about how our reality plays out, they should be working on the mechanics of our reality. I'm simply against the use of the *terms* that add \"meta\" to these two areas, because of the confusion they seem to cause us by creating false delineations\/bad intuitions.\n\nYou can see this clearly with a term like \"Meta-game\". This is a description of the game that plays out *within* the base rules of the game. But this is still *merely* \"The game\". This is not *really* some new game. This is a kind of potentially confusing delineation. Except no one goes around pretending that which Poker strategy is in vogue at the time or for which player, is somehow totally detached from Poker. This is the **total** ontology in a Poker context. This is the \"big picture\" of Poker. Yet this is how people behave with ethics, or physics, in philosophical discussion, which leads to a kind of confused, \"apples and oranges\" sort of dogmatism.\n\nA real world example: I just googled \"metaethics\", clicked on images, and in 10 seconds, found [this image](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/iITYcBL.png). Once you understand what good and bad means, that **literally** translates and is extrapolated into what one can and cannot do. \"It is good to save rape victims\" --&gt; \"We *should* save rape victims\". Is-&gt;Ought. Only a rigid, confused, to use a stigmatized term in a purely descriptive, non-pejorative way, \"autistic\"(in the sense of cold aka ethically stunted, pathologically logical, robotic to the point of error) interpretation of the world gets us this kind of rigid delineation and argumentation for it. The cost here is a significant majority of our academia are basically drowning in a cesspool of ignorance(and they pull us down with them, unknowingly) with real world ethical implications.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629307434,"distinguished":null,"edited":1629308633.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9fiive","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p6gi4i","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9fiive","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h9eol3d","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/p6gi4i\/deleted_by_user\/h9fiive\/","retrieved_on":1651643547,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Physics relates to human behavior. There's no \"metaphysics\", there's just physics(the descriptions of the particles in humans) and psychology\/neuroscience(how those particles cause things like consciousness, psychosis, bliss, and other mental states).\n\n&gt; I'm under the impression that the physical existence of Hell is not even remotely proven, whereas the very fact that we are discussing it qualifies for metaphysical existence, doesn't it?\n\nPart of the confusion here is you aren't granting that hell, whatever that is, is a state. States imply a substrate, physical or otherwise. Substrates imply mechanics. You don't need to postulate *anything* else, this is all you need to know to know there is a fact of the matter when it comes to hell, and it is purely generated in the context of the field we call \"Physics\". \n\nI would say strong reasons exist to believe in hell the moment one reflects on our world. More on that later. The second term, again, I wouldn't be comfortable with \"metaphysical\" and say \"philosophical\", due to the harm the \"meta\" causes(we're speaking about the theory of hell-- philosophy). But yes, discussing something implies its conceptual existence, here we agree.\n\nThere's a semantic confusion when the word \"Hell\" is used, because I interpret your use of hell to be specific. \"The\" hell. That's not what I'm talking about. I'm not talking about Christian mythology. I'm talking purely in the broad terms of a *place* where consciousness arises, that is bad for consciousness, bad either in practice or in principle.\n\nHere are the gradations of what that means:\n\nScenario A) A universe like ours exists. Beings like ourselves exist in it. In objective terms, this universe is *quite* accommodating to these beings in theory-- solutions exist for these beings to lead deeply meaningful lives if they could only realize them. They can realize them with the right physical applications, not only theoretically, but actually(moves in the game exist and can be executed). But unfortunately, these beings suffer terribly and in confusion. This is purely a kind of hell in practice-- in principle, in superficially subjective terms.\n\nScenario B) A universe like ours exists. Beings like ourselves exist in it. In objective terms, this universe simply **produces** bad states for conscious beings by orienting them to generate these bad states. Good states usually occur, but bad states eclipse them, not just in scale, scope, number, etc, but also in the mechanics of good vs. bad itself, where bad is fundamentally more bad, than good is good. The very substrate and mechanics of this universe guarantee that, while theoretically being possible to improve conditions in this world for consciousness, it simply cannot occur because \"the game is rigged\" via the mechanics of the substrate of this universe. This is a hell both in practice and in principle. The beings here are not simply confused in suffering, they are often tortured by the clockwork of reality itself. This is a meaningfully hellish world for subjects.\n\nScenario C) A Universe *loosely* like ours exists, in terms of a vast dimension of spacetime only. Beings like ourselves exist in it, in terms of highly sentient and highly conscious beings. In objective terms, the mechanics and substrate of this universe simply produces **the worst case scenario the laws of these physics allow for** for the beings inside this universe. This is an overt, total, maximized hell.\n\n\nI'm calling A, B, C, hell gradients. And our specific universe, I believe falls into B.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629308825,"distinguished":null,"edited":1629310078.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9flo55","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p6gi4i","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9flo55","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h9fjd22","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/p6gi4i\/deleted_by_user\/h9flo55\/","retrieved_on":1651643328,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I loosely am aware of the philosophy of pragmatism but I generally have yet to encounter an \"ism\" that I think makes sense to truly subscribe to, so I generally don't bother beyond a superficial understanding. Purely informally, I'd consider my thinking approach to be unpragmatic, and slightly biased towards \"playing with slot machines\". I'm not anti-science, or anti-reason, or anti-logic, -- I strongly support these things, but we have to kind of \"loosen\" our thinking up too, if I had to explain in the fewest words. We're too rigid, and we're too... uhh, compartmentalizing in a way that is both inefficient and unparsimonious(Both science\/pragmatic values!).

There's no point evolutionarily to knowing the earth is round or the moon is just reflecting the sun.\n\nYeah I think what you're identifying here is that some things are just evolutionarily expensive. And yes, this *says* something about reality and whether or not we become oriented to it. But once we also recognize that the substrate of our reality produces beings that compete for resources, and that there is no referee in this game state, and that this logically will produce and incentivize strategies of very [skilled](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cmp43eP.png) and [sophisticated](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) cheating, we can make sense of a meaningful reason *why* reality is so expensive in the areas that are more immediately meaningful to us.\n\nSpecifically re: the moon and Earth's properties, I genuinely don't think this is true, by the way. It's clearly costly, but there *is* an evolutionary utility. You could be the person that has knowledge, and knowledge simply *has* utility. Knowing the properties of the moon is just *one* \"lego block\" in the total phenotypic expression of formulating a project(and sub-projects) of something like NASA. Everything we do with respect to reality and its representation has *some* evolutionary utility or negative utility, purely as knowledge.\n\nAnd the fact that we're so poorly oriented to know has better\/worse explanations. One explanation is it's costly, but there's also the fact that much knowledge in our journey thus far(and even today) is bad\/depressing\/therefore, bad for survival-- maladaptive. This creates these evolutionary speedbumps for acquiring knowledge. We therefore have [burned people alive](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Giordano_Bruno#Imprisonment,_trial_and_execution,_1593%E2%80%931600) and(NSFL) [tortured them](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/) for the wrong kinds of knowledge, **while** being the delusional ones. It's the *delusion* that evolution has very often favored, not the reality, and this fundamentally has not changed when one looks out at the \"Zeitgeist\", at the \"tone\" and \"quality\" of our reality representations and ability to cohere to reality, despite fewer people getting burned alive for sinning against the dogma in 2021.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629312820,"distinguished":null,"edited":1629313565.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9fum8b","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p6la99","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9fum8b","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h9e8fnr","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/p6la99\/high_entropy_alloys_of_experience_andrés_gómez\/h9fum8b\/","retrieved_on":1651642847,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

You're signalling a kind of values orientation here. You value the authoritative decree(whether you realize it or not), which is purely arbitrary(in the ultimate sense-- I am not saying \"Science and a schizophrenic's fantasy are equally arbitrary in the narrow sense\") and agreed upon. I value what is possible, and therefore I can dismiss something like, a dictionary definition, right? It seems to me like you would struggle to do this. \n\nYou're looking at the dictionary or the encyclopedia as the authority we go off of(You care about what works, right now. Not *as much* about what could be. What **is** now, in 2021). I actually don't share your value. In the ultimate sense I don't care about a *single* thing humans have agreed upon right now, and treat it purely superficially(albeit in gradients of probability-- I do not dismiss rationality or logic).\n\nHere's an abstract analogy for what's happening in our conversation at *this* stage:\n\nWe're playing a game, both of us. This game has rules. \"You may move X times in Y game state\", the rules say. You point to the rules. You pull out the rulebook, \"Look! It **says** it, right here!\" Right? The point of confusion here is I actually do not care about these rules, ultimately. What I care about, are questions like: \"Does this *rule* make sense?\" When I offer reasons, one has to demonstrate why these reasons are wrong. One can't just point to the rulebook, when I'm questioning the rulebook itself, claiming the \"game designers\" and the players who play by the rule are confused about what a good rule is in a meaningful game.\n\nAs a tangent, and point of interest, the *quality* that separates here is a trait orientation which determines what we value. You value pragmatism(what works, what exists in practice, what can be demonstrated now, what is agreed upon by the authoritative status quo). I value idealism, the opposite value (what *is* in the ultimate sense that potentially dismisses everything about \"right now\", what exists in principle, what may not be demonstrable now, what is true regardless of what ant-like monkeys agree upon in arbitrary year 2021).\n\nThere are actually different methodologies that can get one to values a or values b, and it's the clashing of those two values that is occurring here.

Practically every sentence you wrote is couched in your values(Imagine adding \"in practice\" all throughout your sentences, and at the ends of them).

I'm not super interested in comparing capitalism to other systems because I think it's really just splitting hairs-- I diagnose the problem to humanity itself.

It's the lack of awareness, lack of skill, and wisdom, and insight, that creates a feedback of misery.\n\n**Your abuser** \n\n* --Let's assume they are a terrible person for the sake of this. People like bullies were themselves once abused. This is a person who has been oriented to deal with their own suffering by exploiting others in pretty fucked up ways. In doing so, they not only fail to recognize this, which causes them harm(they would absolutely benefit from getting the revelation that they're pretty much a piece of shit-- but the brain of bullies, psychopaths, narcissists, just doesn't *work* this way), so they end up perpetually being harmful for life(and actually suffering from it too, frequently).\n\n**You** \n\n*  --Let's assume you both value having good intentions, and are not paranoid, like you ask in the title. Your suffering comes from the insecurity(both genuine, and not genuine) around this friend who you do value, engaging in financial and social relations with this person you know is bad, and don't value. The fact that she won't side with you, causes you to suffer. You also suffer from your history with this abusive person. You can't let go of this, it's constantly gnawing away, and the friend being around them is a kind of ultimate betrayal that puts salt into the wound created by the gnawing.\n\n**Your friend**\n\n* --Let's assume your friend values her relationship with you. Their suffering comes from feeling like they have to choose between their dealer and the perks of this(something that is undoubtedly valuable to them), and their relationship with you. They lack the skillfulness to see that this causes you immense harm, while you lack the skillfulness to resolve your (very real, and clearly ethically bad) history with the abuser. This combines to create a scenario where tension and conflict builds, and subtle negativity, subtle bad intentions unnoticed(remember, awareness is lacking for sure, we're far from Gods), all just fester and rot away between relationships that are positive, and make them negative.\n\nAll of this is based on assumption. Remember. Don't let me convince you how things are-- this is just a template. Only you can truly reflect on your life. But this is highly likely I think, if you just detach yourself, and look at it with total honesty, in a \"zoomed out\" way. Imagine what a God's eye view would look like.\n\nA sarcastic remark. A guilt trip. A silent treatment. Betrayal. Anger. Jealousy. Emotional exploitation to get what \"we\"(no matter who we're speaking of) want. Me me me me. Everyone is the center of attention here, in their eyes.\n\nThis is the *mechanics* of what is going on here-- the physics. But what would it mean to just let go of all of this? What more can you do? You can either be captivated by the mechanics of suffering and lack the ability to solve the problem truly, while being completely captivated by ego, by emotions like anger, resentment, jealousy, etc-- Or, you can recognize this entire system and say \"This is not worth my friendship. I'm simply letting it go. If she wants to continue this relationship, I've said what I could.\"\n\nWhat does it mean to truly and genuinely say that last quote? And **truly** let go? It means to be truly free from the mechanics of suffering, on your side. It's either this, or we can continue playing the masochistic game where we torture ourselves and others, while lacking the skill of awareness like the abuser does, a person who is almost certainly doomed to cause suffering, unlike you.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629335553,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9h7za0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p6tbrr","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9h7za0","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_p6tbrr","permalink":"\/r\/Schizotypal\/comments\/p6tbrr\/is_this_just_paranoia_or_legit\/h9h7za0\/","retrieved_on":1651639958,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizotypal","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlzo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizotypal","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It's a kind of *forgetting*, by nature, isn't it? It by definition is *temporarily* absent of the clear awareness of every single meaningful and genuine moment you had with your grandmother. Negative thoughts and emotions and sensations captivate our minds, just ragdolling us around like dog battling a chew toy, where we are the chew toy.

Just notice that strange condition, and notice what would happen the moment your attention very clearly recognizes the fact of your grandmother and your relationship to her?\n\nPerhaps you felt exactly this with your kit, but it almost has a *magical* effect, no? The negative emotion, feeling, thought, just sort of dissolves(insofar as we *fully* become aware of this *other* thing-- things we should genuinely be grateful for, but have forgotten). You can do a little experiment yourself and just purely for fun, see what happens when you pay closer and closer attention to the facts of gratitude around your grandmother and the other things you deeply appreciate. \n\nI want to distinguish this from someone telling us to \"think happy thoughts\", because I think *that* sort of thinking generally gets a negative reaction, and is frustrating, because if one is in distress, we often feel like we're *running* from something when we do this. And then what happens? That thing will chase after, of course. So wishing something positive in some \"fake\" sense, may work sometimes, but it isn't super meaningful.

The effects of meditation are simply increased awareness, somewhat analogous to the effects of 5x5 deadlifting several times a week directly resulting in increased strength. Now, one could argue that it's possible to do nothing but relax and try to pay attention for half an hour a day, and get nowhere with respect to attention. This is true, but it's technically also possible for the same to happen with respect to deadlifting. Just harder.\n\nIt's a lot more straightforward to lift a heavy thing, and put it back down. If you *just* do it-- you'll almost surely get somewhere. But injury and bad technique or failure to understand how much weight to use-- these are all possible roads to a failure that results in a thought like \"Deadlifting isn't doing anything for me. Tried it, didn't work\". But in our world, the world where going to the gym and strength training is pretty much normalized, this level of failure is hard to pull off. \n\nThis is not true with meditation, which seems cliche by now, and still fringe, and stigmatized. I would throw all of that away where it exists, and just recognize intuitively that techniques to train attention *must* exist given brain plasticity, and that this technique must involve the *act* itself(Notice and compare: techniques *must* exist to train strength, and this technique must involve repeated use of strength over time). Sorry about this entire song and dance, but this is just one of many common mental blocks. I just have to get that out of the way first.\n\nI'd recommend meditation because *even* in the event it does nothing for your brain fog(something I'd predict is pretty unlikely if you give it a serious try), it will do *something* meaningful for you. I say this because I don't know the nature of your brain fog. I've experienced a few different conditions each being potentially describable as brain fog. This could be a fuzzy(in physical sensation) disorienting feeling in the brain, this could be a breaking of visual focus(as in, when you make a camera blurry vs. focused, due to the eyes not tracking the same), this could be just a failure of attention, and several other states or a combination. \n\nBut there seems to be no doubt that this problem you have generates a lot of anxiety and stress and general neurosis-- meditation is pretty much the antidote to these things, even if it doesn't end up stopping your potentially neurological, or perhaps psychological, condition, it **will** target the **effects** this condition has on you. In the same way that developing a strong core and lower back muscles can sometimes do wonders for certain lower back pain(if one trains safely), but it can't fix something like thinning discs themselves.\n\nI'd also recommend physical exercise, because it has positive mental effects. But this is just a bonus, I think. The real prize here to focus on is really dedicating to training the mind. Even if you had *no* brain fog, I'd say it would be a crucial move on anyone's part. I wrote a short guide [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/p0il9c\/has_anyone_been_able_to_get_off_the_hedonic\/h88jf2h\/) but you can go get a meditation app or look up a guided meditation from youtube(I'd recommend something from Joseph Goldstein). It's not all created equal unfortunately(just like there are uninformed grifters in physical fitness), the same should be expected here. A serious effort only asks a fairly long college try-- 2-3 months should do, around 10-20 minutes a day(experiment occasionally with longer sessions). It's up to you if you think that investment is worth potentially getting rid of your issue(or improving mental acuity generally). \n\nIf you consider how much time we spend per day purely lost in pointless neurosis, then surely we can afford to just cut 10 minutes from this masochism to do something that at least *claims* to train attention, if for no reason other than as a sheer placebo to be neurotic for 10 less minutes per day for 2-3 months and see what happens?","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629356574,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9i7ln2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p723pf","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9i7ln2","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p723pf","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/p723pf\/how_do_i_reduce_brain_fog\/h9i7ln2\/","retrieved_on":1651637854,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

First of all-- I don't think there's something \"wrong\" with you as a person-- I think the world is a) not a very good place frankly with lots of bad people(only a few good people) and then b) not very hospitable or accommodating to people who are the victims of bad people. This is me preferring to tell you what I think is true over something that sounds nice.\n\nI think you'd be better off just focusing on healing for yourself. You don't need someone to \"complete you\", you're a complete person right now, just recognize that you have a unique wisdom at this moment, whether you've already realized it or not. This is from the specific life you've lived that no one else has access to in precisely the same way. Only you have that wisdom, it's waiting to be realized. I believe that is true without knowing a single other thing about you, because I think it's true about everyone alive. There's *nothing* to loathe about yourself-- this is a confusion that comes from not understanding that no one makes themselves. No one chooses to be thrown into abuse, which produces **both** abusers and victims, right? Realizing this makes the self-loathing float away like a cloud. It just stops making sense.\n\nBut there's this superficial sense that you may sometimes *feel* incomplete, as a person who has some wounds that won't heal quite right because of a bad hand in life, one that not you or anyone could 'deserve'(despite what abusive people may sometimes say-- it makes absolutely no sense). Just remember-- you *know* how dishonest and cruel and thoughtless these people can be. Sometimes we're not lucky enough to be taught how to be, sometimes we're shown rather how *not* to be. That's all we can try our best to do, right? Doing that is a genuine positive from a negative that doesn't make the negative okay.\n\nThe reason I would say loneliness isn't something to be feared or worried about, is because [there are worse things](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/rOi9b20.png). It's when we forget this that we truly down in the misery of loneliness-- and there's no need, because again, there's no one to \"complete\" you-- you're just fine just the way you are as a human being with real feelings and thoughts, who can suffer, and doesn't deserve to anymore.

And the next question is, \"Why do we escape death?\" \n\nBecause a sentient thing that can't fear death and is aware of it(ie, psychopaths), or a sentient thing that has wished it away\/permanently forgotten\/invented memes(ie, religions) that say \"You die, but you don't *really* die\", has a survival advantage over something that is sentient enough to recognize what *will* happen.\n\nWhat is the unifying variable that drives all of this machinery? The ego. The thing that is insecure, that is self-concerned, that needs stimulation\/gets bored, the thing that is callous. Without the ego, every war is incoherent. Every discrimination. Every injustice. Every betrayal. Every instance of torture. Every act of theft. Every child made fun of. Every lie told, from propaganda to tiny lies. Virtually every significant moral harm humans do to themselves and other species is very difficult to prop up without the ego.\n\nWhat happens when egocentrism is reduced? These things wither away. In this light, the global campaign against drugs(anything that shakes up the ego narrative to produce *some* kind of different experience), but particularly the drugs that dramatically reduce the ego\/put the whole fantasy into question(psychedelics), are forbidden. Everything in that DoD passage is much better understood in the context of the ego, because it's not merely accepting the reality of death that's the issue here. \n\nMerely acknowledging the reality of death leaves us with the baseline maladaptive neurosis of \"Oh god... I, the main character of this story, will some day cease\". To get to the bottom of the issue requires identifying the ego. Ego goes away, and *meaningful* death response appears. I say meaningful to distinguish this from say, the death response of psychopaths(low fear\/low risk-aversion), or the religious. These are just tricks of genes and memes that get around the fact of death slapping the ego around, which ought to reduce it, but instead cause it to continue running the show.

Sometimes the lines blur here, where even if you point out to an anti-social cluster B, like a narcissist, or psychopath, some fact of the matter, right? Even if you paint it for them in plain english, they actually *can't* get it. It's unclear if it's the lack of self-awareness that makes the shame impossible, or if the inability to feel shame is just permanently there in case any self-awareness slips through.\n\nAnd all expectation sometimes tells us they should. This causes victims of these anti-social cluster-b's to suffer terribly, because it's the feeling of walking in a direction, but then bumping really hard into an invisible wall, over and over. But one has to first understand that they *cannot* get it. They cannot process ethics.\n\nThey can't grasp the idea that forcing a child to do something like knitting to groom her into what the parent thinks is \"the ideal human\", is probably going to be harmful for the psychological health and development of the child. Or that suggesting that LGBT couples are somehow inadequate to raise children. These concepts are not even political, politics really obscures what's going on here. It's at the level of personality disorder, and traits. \n\nIt's actually not that easy to accept that some humans cannot feel shame. They don't have that \"Oh shit!\" moment when it's pointed out that they're colossally failing ethically. That simply isn't in the cards for them. It's just \"Me me me me me\" cranked up to 11. Their way, or the highway. And everything is going to be structured around their values, their interpretations, right? There's no like... curiosity, like a psychologically healthy person would have, that goes: \"Hmmmm... what does this person mean? Perhaps they're right, and I'm wrong?\" That again, is not in the cards. That possibility is **not** going to occur, in the neurons. They are incapable. \n\nThis has to do with the *traits* of narcissism. The tendency for low agreeableness, and low openness to experience. You can see how these traits encapsulate and protect the narcissist's ego. It's a kind of strategy to perpetually be able to say \"I'm right, you're wrong\". I won't suggest \"Don't waste your breath\", because I know sometimes you have to uhh, confront the narcissist. But I will say that you should **know** very clearly, and precisely, that you **are** wasting your breath when you're speaking to one, in some sense. As long as you fully acknowledge this prior, just sign a waiver in your mind, you'll come out of the whole process with far more sanity than if you were under the impression that words or reasoning or logic should work-- they do not, unfortunately-- for everyone.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629427277,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9m5sfv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p7kr9y","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9m5sfv","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p7kr9y","permalink":"\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/p7kr9y\/my_mom_decided_not_abusing_children_is_a_lesbian\/h9m5sfv\/","retrieved_on":1651629554,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

We *think* that intelligence must be responsible for some kind of introspection or critical thinking, this seems correct to us on paper, but take the case of a narcissist or psychopath. They can be intelligent. But they lack self-awareness, and things like the ability to feel shame. So given those traits, they just won't likely ever question the utility of malice, at least not in a way that leads to the right answers. It's not a side on the \"dice roll\" in their brain. The neurons won't get them to \"Ohhhhhh, being a sadistic asshole is **bad**. I've been so wrong all this time...\". You can tell a narcissist exactly what they're doing wrong, and it simply will not register in the brain in a truly meaningful way.\n\nYou're right about cognitive dissonance, we're certainly oversimplying things here when we describe the problem since many complex biases like cognitive dissonance, self-serving bias, self-deception are operative here in a big ecosystem. But I don't think even cognitive dissonance is the distilled variable we need. Even good, psychologically healthy people have cognitive dissonance, and they turn out mostly fine, or when they don't, their behavior is incoherent given who they were.\n\nThere's a logical component to a concept like \"questioning the utility of malice\", certainly, but that never actually gets processed fully without **other** crucial traits and values. One actually has to be, in principle, a kind person, not anti-social. One has to be open. Value ethics. And so on-- these just do not meaningfully exist in the narcissist\/psychopath. That's the reason I say intelligence is overrated-- intelligence can even be set to 200, and as long as the truly **crucial** traits are not operative, the kind of introspection you describe will not happen, I believe.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629429104,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9m9byh","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p4z6yv","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9m9byh","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h9m83tp","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/p4z6yv\/wtf_706_why_is_a_good_question\/h9m9byh\/","retrieved_on":1651629361,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Some of us? All of us? This is important to distinguish and recognize that some of us have sadomasochistic traits. What would be the strategic advantage of simultaneously getting pleasure from the suffering of others, **and** also being motivated to suffer oneself? \"No pain, no gain\" makes sense to some degree, in the gym, or when overcoming fear in speaking to a potential romantic interest, or when learning a very challenging skill, but could it also be used to give evil an advantage? \n\n&gt;At most, I get people who are sadistic and like to troll me just for having innovative ideas meant to get us straight out of hell.\n\nAh, interesting that these sadistic people exist, isn't it? What does history say? It shows us child sacrifice. It shows us rape and murder, prior to civilization. Once civilization arrives, it shows us things like the brazen bull, where rulers would put people in a large metal hollow bull, lock them inside, and light a fire under the bull-- roasting the person alive slowly over a 10~ minute long death of immense pain and terror. This was used as entertainment as well, apparently. Could these be... the winners, of our game with no referee here on Earth? Who would win soccer\/football matches if there was no referee? What would this game look like, when no one enforces the rules? What does it look like even *with* a referee?(For anyone unaware of soccer\/football, the game incentivizes a kind of min-maxing of aggressive\/violent\/sadistic\/sneaky behavior, where \"accidents\" always occur, and then political manipulations and deceptions take place, etc).\n\nNow what about today? Well, not much has changed, at the [macro](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KLpM0bo.jpeg) level, and the [micro](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo) level alike. What does this say about the *evolution* of evil? It doesn't seem to be so terrible a strategy that it just naturally disappears-- we know that at least. But could our predicament be even worse than this? Could it simply win? How could you beat it, in the long term? Clearly you can kill evil, but then what happens? A kind of selection pressure emerges, and all you do is you make evil which, instead of being overtly evil, proudly killing and torturing in front of witnesses, instead flashes a [charming smile](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cmp43eP.png) and kills in secret until caught. We know that this form of [camouflage can get quite sophisticated](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) if you just allow for enough time and selection pressure. So just using evil against evil, will never work-- you only make it stronger. History is *full* of evil people thinking they are good, and then killing both evil and good, which [they see as bad](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Giordano_Bruno#Imprisonment,_trial_and_execution,_1593%E2%80%931600). Today we clearly see the consequences of using evil to \"win\"-- it makes evil stronger.\n\n&gt; It doesn't seem like there's any way to win. The better a person I become, the more that everyone is absolutely sick of me. This world is extremely false. People are neglectful and demonic and it doesn't seem like anyone cares about this type of behavior (since they're the same). I feel like people just interpret everything that I say to be evil and false, despite my best attempts to be a good person and only speak based off of objective facts. I find it hard to believe most of the time that this is anything but hell...\n\nLet's investigate this very carefully. Because so far we know evil emerges in this world. This is clear. It also *seems* that there's no way to win-- this seems to be what a sober and careful look at the world concludes, but we should always leave room for error. We could simply be wrong, since we know that our species and life forms here are not just evil-oriented, but they're also oriented to be delusional, biased, psychotic. This would support the idea that the world has evil people and [animals](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PcnH_TOqi3I), which by definition creates a hellish environment. But we can recognize that this isn't the worst hell possible, just by using imagination. There's nothing about the laws of physics that says \"100% of children on Earth cannot be raped\", in practice. That *could* be our world, but it's not. That is a thing worth appreciating. We're in a hellish world, but we're not in \"hell\".\n\nNow, what does it mean to win? Winning would mean, in the ultimate sense, defeating evil, overtly or gradually. This appears impossible, but again, we can be wrong. Openness to ideas and experience is a trait that often separates good from evil-- evil is rigid, it can't change or recognize it's wrong, it is egocentric. So there's one argument that one should do good *purely* in the event that one is wrong about progress. But it's also correct to do good even if evil 100% wins. What can we **wrongly** conclude by what we see about the world? \n\n* a) That this is hell \n\nIt's a *kind* of hell, but is it *hell*? I don't believe so. We should be very careful with words here because the ethical stakes are quite high.\n\n* b) That everything is meaningless, or there is no point to anything, because evil wins. \n\nClearly it's possible to still make a difference, even if one cannot win. One **can** lose less. One could go out and begin torturing wild animals right now-- and we'd simply be in a worse world. One can also just sit here, doing nothing, or purely distracting oneself to run from the fear of the nature of the world, when there's an opportunity to genuinely do something good. *Anything*. Help a fellow sufferer. Continue carefully examining reality, critically, even if it makes our prior theory completely wrong. Just total humility, total honesty, total openness-- the opposite of evil. \n\n* C) That people who are ignorant, are therefore evil, or hold-able to contempt.\n\nNo, of course not. It's purely a matter of luck(usually, *bad* luck) that anyone can see this plainly. But the response to ignorance caused by bad luck is never resentment, or contempt, or spite, or revenge, or anything similar-- these are the responses of evil itself. Some degree of evil is inside all humans(Who knew? The Christians were right about sin, but for purely nonsensical and wrong mythological reasons), because the DNA **favors** evil, and we're descended from hundreds of millions of years of rape, murder, torture, and delusion. It's *fundamental* to the DNA, this strategy. If anyone can overcome it, and we [know people can](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LVpUu5T5mQA?t=22). It takes skill and wisdom and insight, to deal with ignorance. Never force, never just \"Objective facts\". Because ignorance does not care about objective facts, [nor does evil](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/p7kr9y\/my_mom_decided_not_abusing_children_is_a_lesbian\/h9m5sfv\/). Just using objective fact alone is futile-- recognizing this is itself a part of wisdom. Notice-- if this is the worst hell, how can wisdom exist? What does it mean to practice deep wisdom in a hellish world, vs. not? What are the *outcomes* of successfully doing so, ethically? \n\nWe could improve mental\/physical resilience of ourselves, or of a person who could reasonably end up doing yet more good. Say a kind word to someone who can't even recognize hope. Inspire creativity and kindness in a younger person. And many more moves. These are all real possibilities that the laws of physics *does* allow for. Are they right to do **because** they **are** right to do, or are they right to do **only** if good can totally defeat evil? If you were Sylvia Likens, being tortured, what would you think, 1 week in, if you heard someone say that it was pointless to rescue you even if they really could easily do so, just because \"Evil will win in the end\"?\n\nAll we have to ask is, what does it mean to be truly the antithesis of evil? What kind of mind is required? A mind in despair, self-concerned depression\/anxiety\/worry\/fear, etc, or a mind that is like a diamond-- unmoved by the reality of evil and the hellish world, insistent on maximizing good for the sake of goodness to whatever degree is possible?","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629442613,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9mu3aq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p7h8v2","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9mu3aq","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p7h8v2","permalink":"\/r\/areweinhell\/comments\/p7h8v2\/life_shouldnt_be_this_hard\/h9mu3aq\/","retrieved_on":1651628148,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"areweinhell","subreddit_id":"t5_yzbmg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/areweinhell","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Not the bullshit good guy\/bad guy narrative you're taught through culture, or that open racists\/nationalists believe in. It's purely dumb luck.\n\n&gt; That is why Dawkins compares life to a Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma.\n\nYeah, this is also why I think an understanding of game theory is crucial. Just a basic one, I don't even think one has to read anything on the subject. You can simply grant that the laws of the universe function as game rules, and that everything is oriented to play various evolutionary games(and other games, the game of truth, the game of ethics, and narrow games, chess, video games, etc). And that there must be \"best strategies\"(for all of these games, not always mutually exclusive). And then recognize that there is no referee to police fair play.\n\n This simply means that the best cheater who is also the most skilled, wins the \"ultimate game\", which I say is the game of power, since power by definition dictates all other games, but also engineers the more arbitrary rules of reality itself through expressions of power. (ex. I cannot simply walk into the Vatican, and slap the Pope in the face, if I ever desired such a thing. This is a function of power, I am powerless compared to a figure like the Pope, who has power.

I think magic was(probably still is) such an utterly powerful meme that captivated people's brains, and quite literally altered reality. These were people who were in **total ignorance** of a concept like the placebo effect, which a 10 year old can look up online today and understand in a few seconds. Just recognize that.\n\nAnd yet they saw things, absurd things, and had to explain it in the context of their ignorance. Magic! And then slowly over time, this was systematized. If someone looks at another person and give them the Evil Eye, well then-- that's real magic. They really make that person uncomfortable. They really seem to express power over that person if that person is not as mental-illness oriented as they are.\n\nIt turns out that's just a bullshit human dominance game, fully explainable through neurochemistry, evolution, game theory, and psychology. The one who looks away first is either afraid socially, or so secure in themselves that they can very confidently re-engage eye contact, and raise them their own \"Evil Eye\". Woah, a stronger sorcerer!\n\nAll kinds of beliefs were invented and then converge in \"The occult\". Another one, a very early one, was child sacrifice. Virtually all human societies thousands of years ago(and possibly more recently) did this. They would bury children(alive) under buildings because they thought it would make the Gods who decided such things not get upset and cause them to collapse. Turns out, total bullshit fantasy, and it was purely the evolutionary advantage of being a sociopath over a kind person that said: \"Please, think of the children... let the building fall, we value sentient life more than anything\" or some other ethical concept which was surely operative in principle because even primates like small monkeys express this kind of ethical behavior(monkeys would rather starve than cause electric shock to a neighbor monkey they see in the next cage, in lab setting).\n\nThis evolved into really complex, religious child sacrifice, like [building giant furnaces resembling and evil God](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Moloch), where all kinds of things, notably children, were placed as a sacrifice. I imagine this sort of thing was forced. What are you going to tell the priest who tells you it's your turn to put your newborn in? \"Sorry, I don't feel like appeasing the malevolent being who demands sacrifices\"? No, of course not, then you'd be thrown in(I think the odds of something like this not happening is immensely low, our ancestors were totally psychopathic, psychotic, sadistic, and loved to scapegoat ethical or \"weaker\" members of the group-- this still happens today).\n\nSo what this does over time is it creates cultures that are genetically predisposed to psychopathy-- evil. It kills the good, it kills the genes of the good, it makes you more callous(\"Who cares if a baby dies? Loss is fine\"), and it gives you a superhuman advantage over the neighboring city that isn't burning fucking children alive but just trying to live with kindness and peace. Well guess what. That strategy of kindness? It works great in a vacuum, but if the city next door is roasting babies, their armies are coming for you, and you won't be able to compete with them, because they don't give a fuck, they don't care about ethics, only evil fantasies they can't even recognize are evil are running their reality. Their brains are optimized for just doing whatever it takes to win because the evil bull god or whatever bullshit they invented is now on their side, since it has been fed enough live-roasted children(and probably adults). That's how that game plays out.\n\nOver time, all of this stuff, *seems* like magic. It seems *real*. But it's simply game theory, psychology, evolutionary biology, physics, and so on. That's all the occult is, it just turns out that \"Evil is very effective at winning\", so when you basically endorse evil behavior, and then couch it in spooky mystical interesting magical language, and call it occult, then it *actually* seems to work-- and that's all the genes care about in the end, not \"Does it make sense?\" but rather:\n\n\"Does it **work**?\" \"Does it **win** genetically?\" Nothing else matters to the genes.

Things are rusting, weathering down from the elements, degrading somehow, etc., only to be built back up. This is why beings who are adapted to entropy will tend to win games in our universe. \n\nThis concept can be taken very broadly, beyond particles. If one of [Ted Bundy's](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cmp43eP.png) victims decides to fight back with a knife, and makes a deep gash on his face, what does this mean? This is relatively trivial to Bundy, I would say. Bundy was a sadomasochist among other things. He not only is motivated to cause those around him to suffer, he is pretty fine with suffering comparatively. It's part of the whole complex of how evolution gets the gears of evil and power(generally synonymous imo) turning. He's either okay with it, or it motivates him somehow to produce some sort of evolutionary strategy. Now, it could always be that he responds like a sane person: \"Ahhhh!, my face...!\" but this would probably be more of a bug, a sub-optimal strategy resulting from some kind of narcissism\/egocentrism rather than a feature. Psychopathic phenotypes have many fail-safe switches here, because from here callous aggressive\/vengefulness can take over once the brain recognizes that the target of the psychopath's desire caused the injury.\n\nAt the other end, a psychologically healthy person(Which by definition means, evolutionarily 'unhealthy' in ultimate terms-- this is like being a cow who will genuinely not harm any creature in any context that could be called evil, ever-- it is equivalent to becoming a [victim of evil](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg)) will have that sane reaction. And they *don't* have the psychopathic phenotype, they simply have the basic mechanics of the cow-- fear, intense pain, concern, shock, etc. There's no motivation to \"get back at him\", there's no thrill of something new and exciting happening. \n\nEven just \"excitement\", we can see is, is not just a motivation for food and sex and other things that feel good, which clearly are adaptive, but also a kind of entropic adaptation. What is excitement? What is it *based* on? Something *new*. Novelty is often involved. \n\nJust imagine if you were sitting here, and **nothing** changed. Your visual field didn't move. You couldn't move. You didn't experience any physical pain at all, and no psychological pain, except for one kind: Boredom. This is because human species and many others, are *oriented* to this kind of stasis. How could they not be when they are evolving in an entropic gradient? Any being who was completely vulnerable to entropy would just perish. And a psychopath is **deeply** oriented for excitement(the species is in general, but psychopaths especially). Not just the thrill of predatory behavior, but there's also a disposition towards hard stimulants here and a meaningful relationship between pyromania and psychopathy\/sociopathy. Excitement *while* in control(which is usually entropic, since there are many more chaotic states than ordered states potentially) is something the genes are motivated towards. A domination machine which competes for resources, is resistant to entropy, and causes entropy, is the most powerful I can imagine in the universe. And this is a description of evil-- it cannot be negotiated with, and it simply causes misery everywhere.\n\nThe point of all of this isn't to just cause chaos, because this is a domination strategy, which is a kind order. It's an expression of hierarchy. But in doing so, entropy and entropy-resistance has been, in various ways, weaponized by evolution.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629580388,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9u07ii","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p85rot","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9u07ii","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_h9stpr3","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/p85rot\/the_selfish_gene_an_altruistic_recommendation\/h9u07ii\/","retrieved_on":1651612199,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Sometimes I imagine badness is required to contextualize goodness, other times I imagine that merely the concept of \"bad\" is sufficient. I lean towards the latter, but I'm open to the former, although that would be disappointing, it would be the more pessimistic reality.\n\nWhat makes me doubt this is constantly seeing people, often younger people, people who sometimes have not lived through hell or recognize a wide range of perspective, but are instead stuck in egocentrism, who really have not considered just how bad things could be, both for themselves, and our world. \n\nI know how infuriating something like this is to hear, because I was invalidated this way myself throughout the first half of my life. Clearly the presence of something worse doesn't make a less worse thing any less subjectively miserable, and is a kind of psychological abuse in most cases to point out(\"Stop complaining about 'x', you have instead suffered the much worse 'y' or even worse 'z' \"-- is often used as bullying, this was told to me many times), but there's still room to miss the point here. \n\nThere's a perspective shift that occurs the moment one truly considers the lower ends of the human experience gradient, and contrasts this. There's a way to recognize one's misfortunes in the *context* of a bad world, and few people do this. Again, the presence of worse, does not invalidate less worse. But the ignorance of it, really does creates a neurotic egocentrism. \n\nYou see this in children, if you ever see a particularly bad tantrum. The child wanted ice cream for lunch, but that wouldn't be nutritious. So they go ballistic; kicking, screaming, biting, and completely refuse to cooperate. This is because this child lacks the wisdom and insight to understand that their personal tragedy, is contextless. It's in the context of their sheer egomania. They feel they are the center of the world. If you could \"inject\" the reality of the world's context, into their brains, mid-tantrum, then it would instantly cure their psychological suffering, and often, even the physical suffering. Instantly. Just... eyes would open, facial expression would dramatically change, they would stare into nowhere, deeply appreciating how confused they were, captivated by new perspective. This kind of deep awareness is uncommon for both children, and adults. Not many people \"grow up\" in this way, some of us suffer like children for life, but rather than children, we're even more confident, even more egocentric, sure that \"we're correct\" and that the person suggesting otherwise is certainly wrong. \n\nWhat I am a bit more sure of than needing bad to substantiate good, is the opposite: not needing bad moments to appreciate good moments, due to the asymmetry of good and bad(where merely the absence of bad, is good(this is also why a total void\/nothingness is ultimate good, due to this being an ultimate and perfected absence of bad. Any other scenario means there is a *chance* for bad, in principle). This means that unlike the absence of good, one can simply recognize all the bad things that have not\/are not happening, and recognize them as good.

I *earned* that!\", then... how can we account for the fact that we were the kind of person who works hard vs. the kind of person who doesn't? \n\nAnd then what about the things that are more obviously based on luck? Which country one was born into(Nationalist pride, proud to be an American, proud to be Spanish, these are all just incoherent, no?)? Which gender we are? The fact that we were born into wealth, into a giant trust fund? None of it makes sense, because none of it originates from \"us\", so how can we be proud of anything we were randomly thrown into?

Either, \"Hmm, that's interesting, because...\" or \"No, I've considered that, and I don't think so because if you look at it...\" or \"Yeah, and there's kind of a connection you can see between that and this other thing...\". Basically, when I look for smart, I'm looking for gears turning. If I don't see any processing going on, then it's hard for me to understand how they could be smart.\n\nThat's because \"gears turning\" is something that's going to be transparent to you, and often to the other potentially smart person. More often to *you*, though. It's this kind of hubris\/ignorance that often contributes or leads us to conclude, \"What gives, this person doesn't seem smart\". \n\n&gt;  In graduate math world, talking to basically anyone in your classes for 30 seconds would reveal at least a certain minimal level of capacity. I do remember talking with a fellow student (who was a math teacher of some kind before going back to grad school), and while mostly he was helping me with gaps in my knowledge (I was basically re-learning Calc 1, and learning Calc 2\/3, and Linear Algebra, in the space of one semester), there was a time or two I would talk about a concept from class, and he would go, \"Wow, you actually understand this stuff!\" Um...of course I do. How are you doing this? Are you just memorizing procedures without really getting what's going on? Was that an option? I could never bear to accept a math equation or procedure unless I understood why. \n\nThe confusion here(and I know you start by saying \"in graduate math world\", but it really is relevant to understand what \"smart\" is in a sophisticated, broad way) is that the thing you're describing is a kind of intuition resonance. This means that an adept or outstanding mind not only is such a thing, can demonstrate such things externally, but can also tend to make these conditions intuitive to others. This is sort of like the distinction between being a star athlete(Like Lionel Messi), and being a brilliant football\/soccer coach. It's one thing to be and to do, and another to cause intuition. It's the last two that tend to convince you \"This person is on another level\", but what is only actually required when it comes to intelligence, genius, etc, is **only** the former. \n\nEdit: After re-reading, I thought it important to mention that, while yes, a strong relationship between being and doing exists(you must do 'the thing' a lot to be smart or skilled), in something like genius it's not really apparent to us because the only requirement is internal-- purely inside one's mind. This is why Messi *being* a football god without *showing* us he's a football god seems utterly incoherent-- how could he satisfy the \"be\", without the \"do\"? But it's purely due to the arbitrary causal relationship of our physics and biology. Imagine a \"Messi\" just materializing out of nowhere and just doing nothing interesting whatsoever. This would be a totally uninteresting individual, and as long as he stayed this way, you'd be clueless about what he really is. This how profound intelligence often works from our narrow points of view, and really [all of reality](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egocentric_predicament).\n\nThis is why autistic savants exist, who you simply could never get through to, nor could they get through to you. It's purely through some kind of other medium where you even get the *chance* to go, \"Oh okaaaay... this person is outstanding.\" We forget that there's really a prior fact of the matter here, purely **being**, and this only need be internal. I'm saying it is possible to be the least recognized genius on the planet Earth, and no one may know, because you're not expressing something recognizable as profound genius to arbitrary bumfuck year 2021 human beings. The bar for \"genius\" to these people, is much lower.\n\n&gt; I also remember once I was stuck on a problem, and trying to reason my way through it to no avail. So I go to extra help, and I explained to the TA the equations and reasoning I had done up to there, and how I thought I could get the answer if only I could figure out how to do this and this and wanted to know how to do that...and the TA I was asking was looking at me with a blank expression. \"Um...did you try looking at this page?\" they said, pointing to an equation I was apparently supposed to just plug the numbers into. And no, honestly, I hadn't looked at that page. Well, I kinda did, but it was just a skim, because reading the book was so goddamn unbearably boring for my brain. At the same time, I wondered: Did this TA not really get what was going on here either? I felt like such a dunce in that class, and yet I'm not sure if the people who didn't were smarter than me, or if they had just previously memorized some shit that I hadn't.\n\nYes, well here you expose what we value as humans and associate with intelligence, vs. what a more sophisticated intelligence is. Much of what we value is pragmatic, book smarts. You get *tons* of booksmarts in our world, particularly in *one* field, and that's it. You're simply set. You could have a perfectly average IQ, but if you have a stellar memory, are fairly neurotypical, have high conscientiousness, a ton of booksmarts and above average social skills-- you're golden. Some of us could even call such a person a genius, because that's the sort of thing our world values. We don't care about the drooling autistic child in the 12th grade with an IQ of 205 that no one can even realize because they're all too stupid and biased, simply sitting there, in their own heads. The point here is we have a very narrow conception of what intelligence is, and we're almost certainly deeply confused on the subject, due to what we value as a species. Primarily hard(in the sense of drudgery more than challenge) work(which... dun dun dunnnnn, is often boring for very intelligent people!)\n\n&gt; I sit here today as something of an underachiever. I've watched peers who didn't seem as smart as me, surpass me. I've met and worked with people who have risen high in their field, or become very wealthy, and come away with confusion, thinking \"Really, that guy did all that? He doesn't even seem to understand...\" And there's a confusion about how and why, which I suppose makes me 'dumb' to that. But, being jealous of successful people, I try to imagine their mindset. What are they thinking? Are they thinking? Or are they just on some sort of automatic 'go go go' that I'm incapable of, and the effort proves superior?\n\nCertain recently former US presidents are very wealthy and successful. What's your intuition about their intelligence? How deeply curious they are? How meaningfully the gears are turning? Their openness to experience? Their creativity? Or, is it just sheer egomania, nepotism, narcissism, high conscientiousness, an utterly self-absorbed competitive attitude, and luck that does most of the heavy lifting? Let's leave it at that.\n\n&gt; I would have guessed him to probably have an IQ below 100. Am I wrong? Am I missing something in my conception of people's intelligence?\n\nMy mostly blind guess is yes, you are. And I've mostly explained why I think we as a species do this(I haven't mentioned it yet nor won't beyond this tangent but there's also the Dunning Kruger effect, the existence of which we should be deeply sensitive to). We simply don't understand intelligence in 2021. Too narrow, too bogged down by the baggage of our values. Intelligence I think isn't some straightforward gradient like IQ, where one just gets hotter or colder. Very narrow, very fine grained, not \"it\". Instead I think it's a giant matrix. \n\n\n&gt; Contrast that with the fascinating mini documentary about Rick Rosner by Errol Morris. Rick is such a fascinating case to me, because while I entirely doubt he is literally the 1st or 2nd smartest person alive, I think it's clear from listening to him that there is incredible horsepower beneath his skull. But at the same time...ugh. In fact, I think \"ugh\" is exactly the proper reaction to watching this documentary. How can this guy simultaneously be so smart, and yet so...stupid?\n\nA lot of what we think is related to intelligence, is actually not. Very often I'll find an argument for smart people \"being stupid\". And I'll think, \"That's all wrong. That has almost *nothing* to do with intelligence.\" We again, simply inject so much of our own values, what we believe *should* be good or hold utility, onto this concept of intelligence and then from that, wrongly assume a person who is intelligent in some narrow information processing sense, should have avoided it. I think ethics is probably the number one area(A smart person should be a *good* person, is the intuition you see), but I may be biased because this is one of my main topics of interest.

Then commit yourself to these \"goals\", just make sure the pursuit will actually make your life more meaningful and beautiful, even if you may not achieve some or all of your expectation, because anything worth doing is worth doing well, success would be great but failure is also worth the price. (I'd say any failure encountered after such a commitment is not really failure, its just luck of the draw and doing your utmost best is success in itself, **just like the fireman that ran into WTC on 9\/11 before it collapsed**\n\n(my bold)\n\nOr the terrorist whose explosive laden vest prematurely exploded. I mention this contrast to expose how utterly arbitrary \"Doing\" is. This is one of the core problems with pragmatism. Although pragmatic approaches have tremendous and undeniable utility, and bring us logic, reason, science, and so on-- good things, we pay a price for it that I see almost everyone who endorses *some* kind of action, fails to appreciate: It's largely egocentric. Which is what I see Schmachtenberger's philosophy seems to be. It does recommend some kind of trimming away of things, but only in an egocentric context. \n\nThis does not make sense to me, because imagine a tool-using, language-using, intelligent Shark applying this philosophy. You just get a hellworld. Humans are more like sharks this way, and they've in fact been doing precisely this: What they **want**. And when everyone wants different things? Who wins? Well, quite simply, the most powerful do. This has been the simplest description of human and even animal history on Earth. \n\nOne either says, \"No, we need to stop this moronic, DNA fueled, egocentric ride. We need to sternly re-evaluate everything, including \"Forward, Onward, Work, Do, More, Faster, Better\" &lt;-- This can **all** be wrong, and we'd be clueless, as long as we're operating on some kind of heavy pragmatism or hedonism. Clearly what is prescribed by Daniel is not as delusional as say, the ideologies of religion or certain extreme politics, but it still to me does not grasp the problem: Egomania. And that is because it mostly endorses it or sees it as unsolvable, which it isn't.\n\nIt's a hefty task to be mindful **as an ego**. Just plug in the shark or some other predatory animal again:\n\n&gt; Being - be mindful of your current situation, appreciate the beauty and meaningfulness of your reality as it is. I'd add this is valid even if you are currently in a bad situation, because if you cant see the positive value of your own existence, then you wont be able to move forward with any improvement, you'll just be depressed and roll downhill forever. \n\n\"The circle of life... so beautiful.

We are now committed to this goal.\" - Killer whales\n\nWho gives a shit about arbitrary wants and desires? This has almost nothing to do with ethics. Wants and desires are purely accidentally related to ethics, as in the desire to not have hot oil poured onto your genitals for 2 weeks by a sadist. It's variables that mostly totally separate from desire that make this unethical. Otherwise ethics would be purely meaningfully described in terms of hedonism, which is absurd. What is the \"thinking person\" or the \"popular modern philosopher's\" solution to this? Almost always some form of nihilism or anti-realism or other endorsement of \"meta-ethics\", all of which serve to trivialize the fact of ethics-- something which is strategically **required** for a domination machine(like Killer whales, if they could entertain ethicsd, like humans, who can). You can't seek power **and** be ethical in any ultimate sense, because the most powerful thing does not give a shit about ethics, that's what total power **means**.\n\n&gt; Becoming - basically make sure you stay on course by repeatedly droning on \"Being\" and \"Doing\", you may stray from the path due to whatever problems of life and necessity\n\n\"We must keep it circular.

If we were such dominance machines(which we are), then it would be beneficial to our species to conveniently reject this idea, because to admit it, to have this utterly explode in our minds with total lucidity, means to fall to our knees wretching and be absolutely disgusted by what we see on Earth. And recognize that this is *embedded* into us at the level of DNA, and that any genuine appreciation of 1) The hellish world and 2) Our hellish nature(adaptively **ignorant** of our own hellish traits and the hellish world-- **purely** a win, in evolutionary terms. Purely a loss, in ethical terms) would be maladaptive for the genes.

So we basically are telling people: \"You don't *deserve* to hear the truth\" when we lie to them. We also presume our way is correct, so being \"proactive\" this way on philosophical grounds also tends to be a bad idea. It's akin to some violent political ideology going, \n\n&gt; \"Whelp, we're the good guys, because we're us-- we're smart, properly educated, we get it-- they don't. Unfortunately, we'd love to do this peacefully but... tragically, our enemies are too evil\/stupid\/flawed etc, so we must use the only move left: violence. :(\"\n\nLying has this precise air of egocentrism to it. While it doesn't directly cause physical harm, it's not an ethical move to make. It's truly the last resort possible when you're standing at the brink of hell, as with violence. We lie and use violence very liberally, because we're evolved to, as these are efficient strategies for dominating our environment, and successfully employing these strategies have been very rewarding for all of the winners of humanity, at every level.

The whole point in evolutionary terms is just creating a narrative, and then acting on that narrative as an expression of dominance which the genes *hope* will lead to replication, somehow.\n\nTo ask at this point, \"But how can something like *antinatalism* or *efilism* lead to genetic success!? Isn't it about as *anti* gene as one can get?! This is ridiculous!\" is to utterly miss the point and not understand that these are just *strategies* by blind molecules. **That is what is inside YOU, right now**. Yes **you**, I'm talking to **you**. Close your eyes and let that sink in for a few moments. Plenty of utterly counterintuitive things in nature to us are potentially brilliant strategies that are very flexible.

So as a tangent I'll say that what most likely explains the silence and stillness of the universe is [camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) which is perfected over inconceivably large evolutionary timescales and then explodes exponentially after truly sophisticated growth occurs(Something that would occur after, say, centuries or millennia of AI research and design). The winners of reality(in the sense of power) are predatory on some level, it's a law of this game space. Your choices are to try to win the power game and lose the most important game( ethics), or to lose the most important game as graciously as possible(Which **is** possible to do).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629679214,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9z4xko","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p8yzey","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9z4xko","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p8yzey","permalink":"\/r\/DebateAntinatalism\/comments\/p8yzey\/deleted_by_user\/h9z4xko\/","retrieved_on":1650582655,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DebateAntinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2872hd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DebateAntinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I think hard\/soft are better choices due to less stigma\/bias.\n\nGood distinctions though, between these two types of Efilism. I think another useful soft\/hard distinction is theoretical vs. activist, and my own position there is no one should be an \"activist\" here-- the road to hell is simply paved by good(and often bad) intentions. It does sound a lot more like Promortalism to me though, even though saying life is not worth living does not necessarily mean death is good, nor that death is preferable. For Efilism to be meaningful, I think, requires a \"why\" in it, to make the philosophy distinct. So for instance in Antinatalism this distinction(even though it doesn't necessarily or explicitly say all life is not worth living), is around the ethics of forcing a sentient being into existence. I think Efilism's distinction around why life is not worth living(both in terms of creating, and sustaining\/promoting), is specifically centered around the mechanics, the substrate, the process by which life emerges and what this entails. This is where I think Efilism is applying \"the magnifying glass\", ethically.\n\nIt's here that we see that a purely arbitrary process causes unethical scenarios where things eat other things in a competition game. Every single act of suffering that exists, is directly traced back to DNA. Every [atomic weapon](https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/transcoded\/7\/7a\/342-usaf-11034_Medical_Aspects-Hiroshima.webm\/342-usaf-11034_Medical_Aspects-Hiroshima.webm.480p.vp9.webm), is an expression of DNA's interplay with other DNA. Every unfortunate [genetic condition](https:\/\/youtu.be\/m_6Y5H9ngZc?t=85), again, DNA is the most meaningful cause. \n\nJust ask-- what is the most *meaningful* way to describe this previous child's condition, in contrast to another child who isn't suffering in this unique way? It's *simply* DNA. To say, \"Oh, well this one's nervous system is clearly sending more pain signals\" or \"This child does not seem psychologically resilient to pain, and is in distress-- perhaps they need to resolve the chemical imbalance in their brain with drugs\" is a kind of severe confusion of the actual problem, no? This would not be a meaningful description of the difference, even though it is technically true that one child lives in severe physical and psychological agony. The true meaningful *cause* of this is found in the DNA.\n\nLiterally everywhere one looks, you can see this expression of DNA and genetic strategies. [Child abuse](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez) and [animal abuse](https:\/\/youtu.be\/FMepy_THcOg?t=13) and everything in between, in all suffering there is **implicated** some type of genetic strategy or expression, almost always some kind of psychopathic dominance game. This is obvious, because every where conscious things go, DNA or some other mechanism is implicated. It's therefore this *mechanism* that is specifically ethically relevant. Without this mechanism functioning this way, we would not get ethical problems-- this is *plainly* true, because for any ethically salient dilemma, *requires* conscious beings.\n\nBut why go to DNA? Isn't this arbitrary, one may ask? Why not point the finger at physics? After all, physics gives rise to DNA, why not say \"Every single act of suffering is traceable back to physics\"? Is it not *ultimately* to blame? \n\nThe answer is no, I don't find this meaningful. The reason is there's nothing intrinsically unethical about physics. A universe of rocks is not ethically salient, it is as free of ethical dilemmas as the void, with one major exception: A cold, dead unconscious universe has the potential to spawn life, where as pure nothingness is the perfected protection against all ethical harm. **Besides** this distinction, these two are ethically identical spaces(forgiving any contradictory language), so long as they have remained and will remain this way.\n\nOkay, so maybe physics isn't to blame. But do we *really* need to look at DNA\/life mechanics? Why not go a little bit up, if going further down is wrong? What would we point to? Brains? Ethics?( You can't win ethically when you compete vs. DNA, when DNA doesn't care about ethics, very obviously. Ethics is a kind of useful camouflage to DNA at best. DNA only cares about power and domination, even if it destroys itself-- like cancer, or a [paperclip optimizer](https:\/\/www.lesswrong.com\/tag\/paperclip-maximizer)). \n\nGeopolitics? Is this the problem? No, because there's no geopolitics [here](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PcnH_TOqi3I), geopolitics is a poor ethical explanation that identifies the ethical bullseye. Nervous systems? No, that's not right either, because you can get plenty of unethical hellworlds without requiring a drop of pain, but you can't get genuinely ethical worlds as long as DNA or some other consciousness-mechanics generates it. If you made a copy of Earth in a simulation, a perfect copy, identical physics, all the bloodshed, everything, but with one crucial difference:\n\n**One hundred percent P-zombies**. Zero conscious experience, subjectively a totally experience-less universe.\n\nThis would still be a hellworld purely in objective terms(almost all Negative Utilitarians will disagree with this, and it's distinctions like these and others why I do not consider ethics to be NU). This would *not* be a good world, regardless if there is zero suffering or not. It would just be puppets spewing fake blood and torture everywhere, it would simply be the least necessary abomination that could exist. Contrast for a second that this world is *far* more ethical than our world, where P-zombies don't exist, and every being actually lives out this torture, and it would be ethically correct to shut down such a simulation if there was no actual point to it. Now, it *could* be a useful simulation. If this was being used to alleviate countless misery in non-Zombie, genuinely conscious, highly sentient beings, then great. Now the perspective changes, now this simulation is crucial to run. But we have no evidence of this for that world, or our own world.\n\nTherefore, it really seems to be DNA(and all other similar systems) + all the game-ified physics, the \"game theory\" of DNA. Which genes win, at the level of the higher beings they produce? The genes which express power. This is all the genes are trying to do. They would salivate(if they could) if they saw some source or attribute of extreme power. That's all the genes care about, that and strategies for maximizing its acquisition in the long run. Let me spell out how absurd and unintuitive this gets, one final time: \n\nSuppose the cows that are tortured in the previous bovine hell scenario(the farm video I labeled 'animal abuse'), somehow found themselves alone in a world without any humans, who were wiped out by some strange extinction event that left all cows unharmed. Suppose these cows then repopulated the surrounding space, and grazed on all the weeds and plant life that would quickly regrow once there is no more human interference in the world. Suppose it took a million years, but these cows then developed intelligence, language, and tools like our own. \n\nThen imagine these cows recovered human artifacts, and bootstraped to a civilization that colonized the solar system. During this entire process, the genes simply **do not care** that it took millions of years of bovine torture. They're finally getting their \"prize\". The biggest \"loser cow\" in this scenario is just a free rider on the \"win\" of the value system of the \"biggest winner cow\"(which operates on the genetic value system-- winning the game of power). The seemingly endless torture world they were subjected to is happily paid for, because the **genes don't need to pay**. As long as there's no extinction, these genes would sign up for 10 trillion years of perfected torture, **just** for the chance to \"win big\" later-- that's how the DNA value system operates, in principle. These cows do not exist of course, they are a fictional example. But humans are not a fictional example, and we function roughly the same way.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629682820,"distinguished":null,"edited":1629683106.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"h9zc9cw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p8mxme","locked":false,"name":"t1_h9zc9cw","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_p8mxme","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/p8mxme\/defining_efilism_strong_and_weak_efilism_what_do\/h9zc9cw\/","retrieved_on":1650581724,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

But what I see may be ineffable, so I'm going to try to convince you to do the thing which causes the resolution at the subjective level.\n\nThe fact of the matter is these drugs radically alter perception by ultimately lowering the ego, allowing for potentially tremendous insight.

Context of the pain is crucial. In other words, it's possible to be confused about one's pain. If you woke up one day with an excruciating pain in your abdomen and groin that was so bad that it caused you to scream at the top of your lungs for hours, some people may find this to be a threshold for suicide, if it persisted long enough and intensely enough, for no diagnosable reason.\n\n If however, you were a woman and simply giving birth to a child, suicide is pretty incoherent unless you add further context, birth ethics completely aside, but even *in* the case of birth ethics, this would be questionable behavior, psychologically and ethically.\n\nIf one is so far gone into the rabbit hole of birth ethics ideology and thinks there would be nothing wrong here, I don't know what else to say-- a world where mothers blow their brains out while giving birth to their children is a hellworld even if bringing beings into existence is not a wise move, but I can see how rigid, highly axiomatic, systematized thinking would lead one to conclude otherwise. \n\nPain has a purpose, yes, you're right, but we can absolutely be utterly demented and psychotic with respect to our pain just as much as we can about anything else, we are simply not oriented to process reality in any sense, including our own subjectivity. It's a *miracle* if we manage to get anything right.\n\nNow, in the case of something like the worst cases in Right to Die, where one is clearly just pointlessly suffering in an incurable position day in, day out, then I think a world that tells such people they are not allowed to end their own intense suffering is ethically confused. But this doesn't mean taking every suicide desire seriously-- some people really *can* be confused here.\n\nPain is no different fundamentally to emotions, like anger or sadness. Clearly, many cases of anger and sadness are genuine, we're not completely delusional and there is some overlap with our own subjectivity and ethical reality-- which is by definition centered in interest around the experiences conscious beings have(rather than rocks). But this doesn't mean all cases of anger or sadness are to be taken seriously. Sometimes people are angry for deeply confused reasons. Sometimes people have the right reasons, but their anger itself is exaggerated and inappropriate. You'd call someone insane if you saw them step into some gum, become utterly enraged, and then walk into convenience stores one by one, setting the clerks on fire because they \"promote gum\".\n\nPain works the same way. Not just psychological pain, but physical pain too, because whether or not it is endurable(in the meaningful sense, not in the \"in practice\" sense of whether one *can* endure it-- I'm speaking of whether one **should** endure it). Just set up a super bare bones experiment in a simulated reality with our physics. No earth, just a guy named Bob, and you. Bob needs to stick a knife into his hand every 3 hours, for the next 24 hours, or you get tortured maximally for 40 years. If you two succeed, you both just escape. All Bob has to do is just endure this pain. Now... what does it mean about Bob, if he insists: \"Sorry fellow being... but this pain is just too intense. :( I truly can't ... take it... We got here half way, but I really do apologize, but this is just too much. I know, I know-- infinite torture. Ugh... It's crushing me so much but I can't stick this knife into my hand a *single* extra time, let alone 4 more. So deeply sorry.\"\n\nIt's fully possible this person really is just *that* sensitive. We can grant that. Let's pretend they have the misfortune of having the most sensitive nervous system out of all 8 billion~ people on Earth. But what does it *mean* to not succeed in understanding phrases like \"tortured maximally for 40 years\"? It can only be understood in the context of things like a lack of self-awareness, high egocentrism, self-deception, etc. If you were in this scenario, and you heard Bob saying the unthinkable, you wouldn't be able to mentally cope. How ... is this person like this? What could possibly *explain* this? It just wouldn't make any sense **even** if we grant the sensitivity issue. This person would either need to be a covert psychopath and simply be callous towards you, or some other disorder that makes empathy a no-go, or *something*. Because they're *failing* to act in a very obvious ethical scenario. This is not some hard choice. If you get any random ethical human, they will stab themselves for you, no problem. They'd be a hero to, and just about everyone can intuit this who doesn't have some kind of pathology or disorder. \n\nThere are depressed people who can act very much like Bob is, very similar sort of \"not *quite* in touch with reality\/the ethics\". Of course, I've already said there's also space for totally rational suicide. The two extremes of the suicide gradient are the easiest cases-- there's the most frivolous, least justifiable suicide in principle(where you'd need to be Bob-levels of deranged to fail to criticize), and then there's the *most* urgent, most justifiable suicide in principle(where you'd need to be a monster to criticize). It's the middle of the gradient that contains the truly hard cases.

After checking, and we actually find out it's sort of true(after reading that Snopes page, it said \"Mostly true\"), then we *invent*, totally *fabricate* around this confirmation-- we *superimpose* what must be true and treat that as reality. Most people here(and me, to an extent, before checking Snopes and thinking for a few minutes, react with this kind of gut instinct):\n\n* Kind, innocent soul of a worker, donates Kidney heroically to nasty curmudgeon boss\n* Scrooge McDuck cold-heartedly then fires her in a way that would make Steve Jobs look like Jesus\n* Clearly, another case of evil wicked boss doing what they do, and kind innocent workers being exploited no matter how saintly\n\nFirst of all: this could very well be true.

Humans at the bottom rungs are just(NSFL) [devoured like pieces of fruit](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PcnH_TOqi3I), and the reason for this is not that complicated: Genes give rise to phenotypes, which determine things from the way one behaves, to the way one thinks. This determines how powerful they become. Certain genetic strategies lead to the most power, and this is all the genes care about, if they could care.\n\nPsychopaths have an advantage in dominating social or power systems, so they climb them.

It's literally the description of the way one is mentally. So it is 'the thing' that will determine one's ethics. What else possibly could, as directly?\n\nI think something like Schizoid specifically can help a lot towards understanding ethics(but is not a guarantee). Schizoid is linked to dissociation, which I think can sometimes *increase* empathy by lowering egocentrism. I'm not saying Schizoids are some enlightened ego-less superhumans or anything even remotely that dramatic, but that they have a *slight* edge and a tendency to detach from all the bullshit of the ego(dissociation\/depersonalization), and all the bullshit of arbitrary modern ethical assumptions(de-realization). This *can*(not a guarantee) lead to a kind of \"blank slate\"(relative to other humans) to make ethical judgements of, provided this interests them.\n\nOf course, there's room for comorbidity. Schizoid can overlap with some pretty antisocial trait-sets, mildly antisocial\/struggling with empathy, like autism spectrum, to deeply antisocial, like psychopathy. So to stress-- it's not a guarantee. But yes, one's ethics are largely decided by one's psychology, which is responsible for traits like openness to experience, agreeableness, empathy, kindness, concerns for fairness, valuing what is true(orientation towards honesty and intellectual honesty), self-awareness, conceptions of justice, conceptions of meaningfulness, ontological and epistemological representations, and therefore ethical concern itself(nihilism, anti-realism, moral realism, etc).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629703286,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ha08y9d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p9ts8c","locked":false,"name":"t1_ha08y9d","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_p9ts8c","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/p9ts8c\/does_anyone_else_feel_like_they_are_kind_of\/ha08y9d\/","retrieved_on":1650577543,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

To clarify: Intelligence has **nothing** to do with understanding that it's a bad idea to make simulations, intelligence is **purely** this robotic, autistic(not in the pejorative sense, but in the \"cold, robotic, pathologically logical\" sense) process. It's just the intelligence, not the wisdom-- and even someone like Gary who seemed to deeply understand how *useless* intelligence was in ethical terms a few minutes ago, now makes this exact mistake.\n\n Intelligent, high IQ psychopaths can *absolutely* make a simulation. A sloppy one, a bad one, a hellish one. There's no question. The thing that *prevents* people from making simulations is wisdom, and ethical disposition-- notice how psychopaths lack these things in a meaningful way?

And then skipped the entire middle and went to the last 2 years, because I thought those would be pivotal behind motivating the killing. To be clear, I'm neither moralizing you, nor this person. Free will is a fantasy and therefore \"bad people\" are simply unlucky, nothing more(not suggesting you are a \"bad person\", either).\n\n I think the average human being reads something like this, recognizes the pathology, and then is left with disgust towards people like him. But not me. Want to know what I'm doing whenever I read about someone who did something terrible, and seemed to be terrible in almost every respect? I am placing myself firmly in their shoes, and making an effort to detach myself from bias. Every time a thought pops up in my brain, that represents some kind of malice or contempt, I recognize that as a kind of self-hatred instead and try to feel whatever(albeit, psychotic and delusion) pain this person felt.\n\nThis is really one of the few methods to be in touch with reality in cases like this. If this killer had this ability, it would have been impossible for him to harm anyone, despite being deeply harmed and unfortunate themselves. They lacked the wisdom, insight, and skillfulness to examine their lives or the world around them(they did a lot of examining, but this was done in an utterly egocentric, malicious and therefore delusional and psychopathic way). I can tell you with **certainty** this person had never taken 3.5-5 grams of dried mushrooms and just examined with a commitment to honesty and openness how radically different the landscape of the mind can get beyond narcissistic megalomania. And I would further bet that if they did, the massacre would have been very, very hard to perform. Bold claim, huh?\n\nBut yeah, I strongly recommend you read it. Just the first 2 years, and the last 2 to understand the exact mechanics of the pathological thinking to an extreme, in another person. And just to further reduce room for confusion, I want to tell you that it's perfectly human-- all of this antisocial behavior. I remember reading about some arm-twisting fantasy you had in that other thread. This isn't me subtly moralizing you or being condescending to you. This is what humans **do**, all throughout history. They not only fantasize, they literally torture each other for real. The species is like this-- you know this from all the malicious encounters you've had with members of our species(as do I) from childhood up to adulthood. And you get to see how confused and not special it is, in that document. It could be very helpful for you, so I hope you read it with a clear mind that puts as much effort into detaching from egocentrism as possible and recognize how **obviously** mistaken this human being was while simultaneously tragically lacking the self-awareness to see it in themselves. **That** is what should worry every single human being, deeply. \"Am *I* the baddie?\"","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629734786,"distinguished":null,"edited":1629735084.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ha1ov9n","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p7wm66","locked":false,"name":"t1_ha1ov9n","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ha0sszn","permalink":"\/r\/self\/comments\/p7wm66\/do_i_dive_off_the_cliff\/ha1ov9n\/","retrieved_on":1650570954,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"self","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh96","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/self","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

A sophisticated, ethics+truth-oriented species will have no problem **both** accepting this as a potential fact(They won't go \"What're you, crazy!?\"), *or* saying \"Hold on, wait a minute-- pushing this red button may be a premature move at this stage\".\n\nThere will be no typical emotional ideological attachment we see today, and it would largely be a fact based, reason based, ethics based approach. A *real* ethics, not some rule-based meta-ethics bullshit that a robot can express. An ethics where everyone genuinely feels a powerful desire of goodwill founded on concern for sentient wellbeing. \n\nThe distinction between good will and kindness, and *emotionally* driven ethics, such as something based on empathy, is crucial to understand. Empathy can be very helpful for ethics. But it can also be very harmful. It's kind of 'meh', like human brains are in general, for understanding virtually anything. If someone has high empathy and sees someone on the side of the road who suffered a tragic accident, and they have high empathy, many people would intuit \"Oh nice-- finally, an ethical person! A person who can help!\".\n\nBut this is actually to be confused about how utterly trash human brains are. What happens here with high empathy is this person is paralyzed by trauma. This is because empathy is *feeling* what another feels. This could mean a failure to provide treatment that reduces suffering, which could be first-aid, or calling an ambulance, or in the worst case scenario-- quickly and painlessly ending someone's life. It is **empathy**, once it's high enough, that can cause this failure.\n\nOf course, there are *other* traits that cause ethics failure, like the classic sociopath who would just shrug their shoulders or laugh at this scenario. But the point, is really to engineer humanity **towards** ethical orientation. There's a \"best calibration\", because we **know** there are simply **bad** calibrations: those with pathological levels of high empathy, those with zero empathy(sociopaths). So the goal is to perfectly engineer the species to **first** understand ethics-- this literally means \"understanding what matters, understanding the most meaningful thing that could possibly exist\".

Who is me and Who is my trauma ? I think there is only trauma. What should I put in the place of all these abusive speeches given by parental figures ? How do I want to spend my life on the next years ? Am I taking the right choices ? It is complicated. I feel so empty.\n\nThat's okay. Is there something necessarily *wrong* with feeling empty? What do we know for sure? I like how many questions you're asking. It shows a kind of curiosity and openness to discover what is true, at least with respect to yourself, right? The abuse hasn't taken that away. Also notice this self-aware attitude and disposition is precisely the opposite sort of attitude an abusive person has? They're deeply uncurious, deeply closed, egocentric, etc. Something to consider and appreciate.\n\nWe know that we're not our thoughts or emotions, because we can observe these things. \"You\" aren't anger, or sadness, right? How could you be, if you can just recognize it as a pattern in your awareness. It's only when we're truly and utterly *lost* in this pattern, that we feel the intense negative effects. But the moment we recognize it and are not deeply identified, deeply related-- that's when it loses its grip and just floats away like a cloud. We're not *pushing* away this emotion to be clear, the opposite: We're just accepting whatever comes up(internally fighting against negative emotion just makes things worse, right?), and *observing* non-judgmentally. This is a method to make the negative feelings have less of a grip and last for shorter time spans.\n\nIt can help to close your eyes and just take a slow, natural deep breath when doing this and slowly exhale to just naturally relax. Notice when you do this(and I hope you give it a try, even right now, if you're comfortable), the neurosis just tends to wash away? Worries like, \"Am I taking the right choices?\" or \"Will something bad happen in the future?\" or \"The complexity of this, and this confusion, is troubling\" and so on. You *know* these problems exist already, right? Just recognize how the mind can pointlessly torture us in this way for pretty exaggerated spans of time. We just think, think, think... to a degree that really seems unhelpful, no? It's through awareness(remember to take a slow deep breath and close your eyes) that we can interrupt this process, through baby steps.\n\nFrom this new point of awareness, we're actually very empowered. Because the only thing to do in this state, is to express awareness. We're not striving for anything, we have plenty of time later to worry and think(And we *will*-- this is the nature of the mind). But just for 2 minutes, or 5 minutes, however much you can spare-- consider just seeing if you can relax and notice the difference in the mind state of a *more* clear awareness. Surely this lucid state of mind is the ideal state to face any problem with, right? We already know what the most frantic, suffered, despairing states of mind are like, right? Surely these are not good for solving important problems, or even for calmly investigating the mind(which I'm glad to see you're *already* doing-- this is crucial to healing).\n\nIt's also in this awareness, that we recognize the things we thought made us empty, don't *quite* do that. You're already quite wise to recognize that the happiness you get from material things(or really *anything*) tapers down-- this is called the hedonic treadmill. But that's in the context of more thoughts that say \"I want the *next* thing, the *better* thing, right now isn't *good* enough\". But in awareness, you can see that you're complete *right now*. You're a person right now, who simply doesn't deserve to suffer, and is just silently watching, listening, sensing-- no goal or purpose, just natural awareness-- complete.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629748130,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ha2lfc0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_p9y7kw","locked":false,"name":"t1_ha2lfc0","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_p9y7kw","permalink":"\/r\/CPTSD\/comments\/p9y7kw\/deleted_by_user\/ha2lfc0\/","retrieved_on":1650567314,"score":5,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"CPTSD","subreddit_id":"t5_2vvid","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/CPTSD","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

What is it? Is it something objective, like 2+2=4? Or is it just arbitrary? It should be clear that it's arbitrary, right? It's true that some things that *make* us physically cringe, do so for good reasons(seeing someone slip and break their leg, for instance), but this is worthy of that response not because *people* have that response, but because it actually makes sense to react this way to seeing a broken leg-- no moral person would want someone to suffer, so it's fine to signal that sort of empathy response.\n\nThat's *one* kind of cringe. But is that the kind of cringe we're talking about here? No, right? The kind of cringe people are talking about when they use this word is: \"Someone said something I don't *like*, as a matter of my random preference\". \n\nSounds familiar? Someone could effortlessly shit on even the most creative thought as \"cringe\". Someone could call my post right now, \"Cringe\"-- and follow up with: \"What are you trying to do, sound *smart*?\" Who actually cares what these people think? For us to care in this way requires not realizing that this is purely trivial high school tier bullshit people do to bully each other. It would benefit you to **deeply** realize this, like really just *explode* in your mind, because once you do, your insecurity about sounding cringe will just float away in the wind.\n\nAlso worth noticing is the upside. Suppose someone really *does* cringe at something we say. If we truly don't care if we're cringe or not because it's purely a bullshit game, then now we're suddenly in a very good position to take any claim seriously. We could calmly consider: \"Hmmm, does this person have a point?\" \"Was that stupid or distasteful thing to say?\" If so, surely, you only **win** by recognizing it, right? But if we're paralyzed by insecurity, we can't even get here.

It's awesome that you actually recognize your flaws in an honest way, where you actually seem to feel things like regret, guilt, shame-- this is not *as* common as we think. These emotions may feel bad to experience, no doubt about it, but their presence is in some sense a kind of relief if you consider it. \n\nReframing things this way while still being honest with what's going on can help take a lot of the pain away. To be very clear, this is not about putting on rose-colored glasses. We don't want to nor need to delude ourselves at all. We just want a full perspective, which we can't have if we're drowning in negative emotion-- right?\n\nSo it really is a cause for celebration that you can respond this way. Many people are so self-absorbed(through no fault of their own) that they can't even recognize or experience some of those emotions. It's unfortunate that BPD causes so much suffering, but just a reminder-- it's not like you *chose* that, right? It's purely a matter of bad luck. \n\nI think all of your partners, if we hypothetically gave them a thousand years to develop some sort of super-human, deeply insightful, wise, best-version of themselves, would absolutely understand and hold nothing against you. Just imagine that happening for a second. So this is why if you still hold some kind of unhelpful self criticism, or regret, or guilt, or self-hatred, or anything like that-- just recognize that hypothetical ex being totally understanding towards you. Again, no wishful thinking-- this is *simply* what happens when people are deeply unconcerned with trivial struggles and deeply forgive someone on the basis that they are simply an unlucky human being who does not deserve to suffer.\n\nI want to really stress that this is the rational position by the way, it's again not some delusional way of \"getting you off the hook\" for something awful you did or some deficit you have that is worthy of blame or deprecation-- I think all of those things are pretty much nonsense. It really is the case that you had extremely bad luck which not you nor anyone deserves. How *could* they deserve it? Just think about it. It would make no sense. They would need to somehow create themselves from scratch and be responsible for everything that causes them to be who they are-- not even close to possible.\n\nOnce one recognizes that fact, healing is possible and much easier. When we suffer and we don't know how to deal with our suffering(like you suffer with your fear of abandonment), then we will effortlessly cause others around us to suffer, making relationships very strained and complicated, right? But if we recognize that suffering, accept it, and learn to manage it somehow, then it's less likely we will make ourselves, and those around us suffer. If you think about every harm you've encountered from another human being, that's *simply* the product of them being in some sense: a) unlucky b) suffering in *some* way or as a result of *some* thing, and therefore causing you harm.\n\nFrom the simplest thing, imagine that stressed out person who is pacing quickly who you don't notice and carelessly bumps into you somewhere or steps on your shoe. That person is actually suffering and unable to possess the skill at that moment to a) stop their suffering b) stop causing suffering to those around them. All the way to a deep wound from a close relationship, something heartbreaking someone said to you. It's the exact same scenario. Once we understand the mechanics of suffering, managing it actually becomes truly possible for the first time.

Is what is inherent to our world evil? \n\nThe first order of business seems to be identifying which definition of \"Nature\" one is speaking about. One can say the phrase \"Nature is the origin of all evil\" and actually mean several different things. So this is the very first step, if we want to actually be clear or be speaking about the same subject. This is the burden of really any philosophical grounding or any discussion\/argument: semantics. Is it nature in the sense of biological life? Nature as distinguished from man-made invention? Nature as in physics? Or the definition you gave? Or something else? I lean towards \"biological life\" coming the closest, personally, but I'd want to expand that to include possible exceptions if we're trying to pin-point the origin of all evil.\n\n&gt; After all isn't evil a term of subjectivity? Evil is described by Oxford as being:\n\n&gt; \"Profoundly immoral and wicked.\"\n\n&gt; Yet again more terms of subjectivity. There is nothing that is objectively immoral or objectively wicked unless there is a more real being than us that somehow makes it such that it is such. Even if it is still subjective from its origin, it would be objective to us. But that means going into the territory of divine beings, deities, or the existence of a god which is a slippery slope. \n\nNo, I don't think evil is a term of subjectivity any more than anger or mathematical addition is. But aren't these also *subjective*? Again, here part of the confusion is the semantics. We associate bad patterns between a multiplicity of meanings, and then our logical reasoning becomes flawed. Here are some popular patterns people hold:\n\n* Opinions are subjective. Taste preferences are opinions, and there is no objectively true best taste.\n\n* Therefore, subjectivity is brittle and lacking objective truth.\n\n* It is possible to express opinions about ethics.\n\n* Therefore, ethics is brittle and lacking objective truth.\n\n* Anything that a subject can perceive is by definition subjective.\n\n* Therefore, anything that a subject can perceive is brittle and lacking objective truth.\n\nHere are the problems with these sorts of popularly held reasoning. The first is the flipping around between different meanings of \"subjective\" and not really being precise. One meaning of subjective means something like \"the realm of opinion, not objective fact\", another meaning of subjective means \"pertaining to a subject\". What people do is they treat these two meanings as synonymous, but that doesn't follow. There's no reason to actually think there are no objective facts about subjective states\/matters.\n\nWe're operating on the idea that truths exist, just having this sort of conversation. The phrase \"Yet again, more terms of subjectivity\" really means \"The claim that these terms are subjective is **true**.\" If it doesn't, then what does that even *mean*? What does it mean to say there's not a fact of the matter about *anything* at all? This the sort of position that many people who double down on the brittleness of subjectivity often *feel* like they're arguing from, but this is confused. Because they're using the entire framework that acknowledges a fact of the matter, truth claims, and so on, and denying other truth claims, all while saying there really aren't any truth claims. So it's a kind of language game that gets to use logic, truth, and various other values, to \"deconstruct\" or dismiss every other attempt to make sense of anything. You could even deny someone who is arguing for the value of making sense this way. \"Why should we make sense? Isn't it merely subjective?\" &lt;-- Again, when one is arguing from the position of making sense *inherently*, while arguing against it, they really are just failing to see the little trick they're pulling. This is not good philosophy, this is just a very bad game with words that people play with each other.\n\nSo to have a conversation philosophically really does mean to admit there are truths, **real** truths, and that subjectivity is not some kind of permanent barrier to truth. The most easily accessible objective truth right now is the fact that you are conscious as of reading this sentence. Presumably you were reading the previous parts of this post. You were conscious there too, provided you didn't just wake up from some dream world and had the memory of reading that implanted into your mind, despite it never really happening. The fact of the matter is right now, and it really is a **fact**(it can't even be wrong), that you are conscious **right now**. You could be dreaming, aliens could be simulating your experience, whatever. You are conscious right now, no matter what is generating your experience. This is *simply* true.\n\nYet it's a truth about a subject. Brittle? A matter of opinion like \"I like cake, you like pie\"? No, of course not. The same exact way we can look at a person, screaming their head off, smashing the contents of a store with a baseball bat, completely enraged, shouting slurs, and not *only* be forced to admit that this person is angry subjectively, but they are angry **objectively**. That's simply the fact of the matter. \"Is Bob Angry?\" Imagine what it would mean to pretend as if there's not *really* a fact of the matter here. \"Bob may be angry, but he's not *reaaaaally* angry. There's no *fact* of the matter.\" Like... what?\n\nWhat is a person who says such a thing even **talking about**???\n\nThe only way out from here is some kind of dishonest, bullshit semantic game that tries to weasel out of the fact that Bob really is angry. This is the burden of philosophy 101 sparring, and it probably even infests people who think they're producing sophisticated thinking. This is simply what human beings do. Let's look one more time for the criteria of something being objectively true:\n\n&gt; There is nothing that is objectively immoral or objectively wicked unless there is a more real being than us that somehow makes it such that it is such.\n\nWhat does this mean? A more real being? Do facts have something to do with some kind of... \"real being\" hierarchy? I just have no idea what this even means, but to me, facts are simply true like squares are simply square: They cohere with reality, they have 4 right angles, respectively. That's all you need to admit, and then recognize that facts about subjects, and facts that subjects can entertain, exist. Words really do have meaning beyond subjectivity. \"Good\" really *does* mean something(hint: It isn't captured by the idea of boiling dogs alive slowly and painfully for 2 hours to \"make the meat taste better\". It also isn't the process by which carbon14 decays. Words have meaning.). And we do ourselves a disservice if we pretend as if torturing every single thing in the totality of reality **perfectly**, isn't *really* bad. This again, just dismissing the meaning of words on a basis that just isn't meaningful at all. The kind of logical path that leads one to *that* conclusion, is confused, and attempts to instead play a kind of game that thinks it's producing a checkmate, when it's just check-mating itself. This is why moral nihilism for example is so baseless. It tries to say there are no facts of the matter ethically, but then this itself is a fact, is it not? And then what do you tell a moral nihilist who insists nothing matters? You tell them okay, well if it's just totally arbitrary then, enjoy this nice tall glass of 350degree oil.

It's better just to ask.\n\n&gt; I worry that today's personality or neuro types will be tomorrow's version of racism, sexism, and classism. It's all fun and games until it isn't anymore.\n\nOkay, I think I understand what's fueling your worry, I just don't think it's a clearly good move to have a 'better safe than sorry' sort of attitude in this specific case because we pay a heavy price for it. Today's neurotypes, by the way, already *are* today's discrimination, they don't need to wait for tomorrow. People are just confused, namely psychiatry, about what a \"disability\" is, and how it should be responded to.

For instance it really is true that a psychopath has an ethical deficit. This was true 8,000 years ago when no one had a clue what psychopathy was, and this will be true in 8,000 years if we ever get so \"enlightened\" that we pretend as if good and evil have zero coherence to reality and entertain ourselves with a terraformed Mars containing 100 billion children all simultaneously getting perfectly tortured by AI for the viewing pleasure of whatever \"elite and advanced\" beings emerge from our current world.\n\n\n I think what happens in some people's brains is, instead of conjuring images of an [evil person doing abhorrent things to an innocent child](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez#Trial_of_Isauro_Aguirre), they just take the phrase \"A psychopath has an ethical deficit\" and replace psychopath with \"certain races\" instead. \n\nThose are the precise mechanics on how the brain subconsciously slips that kind of strawman in, without even recognizing.

Almost no one admits this and we're all conditioned to just sit there like that \"This is fine\" meme, when the absurd quantity of suffering beings on Earth is an ethical emergency. But the problem has to be identified and agreed upon first for any kind of coherent action. We can't all \"Do something\" when we're all operating from within different versions of the Matrix. That's just a clusterfuck, surely. Notice the problem is more fundamental than rampant suffering. The problem as I see it now is: \n\nIt seems to be that people are a) not super concerned about identifying problems, and b) not very *good* at identifying problems.\n\nRight? Surely, this is agreeable, no matter what one's position on anything is. Now if this is the case, then the sort of energy and effort we need to solve a problem this big is just not going to happen. It's like going to the orcs in Lord of the Rings and saying, \"Shouldn't we seriously reconsider animal ethics? We all need to **act** immediately!\". The idea is correct, no question, but the outcome just doesn't happen-- it's like someone pushing on the gas pedal when the engine of the car is missing and only 1 tire is installed, as the gas tank is full of pudding. The driver has full blindness, and the GPS is set to navigate the opposite side of the planet. We're not only *not* going to make the cross country trip-- we're not even going to move 10 feet, and if we somehow do-- it's far more likely that it will be in the wrong direction.\n\nSo we're really left with a *new* problem, and that is **identifying** and **diagnosing** the car itself and where we are. How do we get a running car, here? How do we **make sense**? There are people who can't even grant that ethical truths even exist. Why should anyone *care* about animals, someone could say, \"Ethical ideas are just arbitrary, therefore animal ethics doesn't matter, since **nothing** matters\".\n\nEven as a species with supposed bias towards each other(speciesism is part of why people claim animals don't matter but humans do), we fail *hilariously* and tragically at even [being ethical towards each other, towards our own offspring](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez#Trial_of_Isauro_Aguirre). We then very formally and academically argue that nothing *really* matters. Why? How? Via what ideology? What thinking? And what is the root *cause* of these ideas, academically, psychologically, evolutionarily, etc? We can't even ask what a moral description of our species is, or ask if [we are the baddies](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8JOpPNra4bw), because we can't even admit that right and wrong are real. What picture can we paint to fully and richly diagnose this problem of just admitting what matters that we don't currently value? &lt;-- This is the **ultimate** problem, because if you solve this problem, you solve literally everything of value under it. \n\nThis doesn't mean that you should shrug your shoulders if you see an animal crying in pain, lying there half-eaten by predators, when you have a dose of drugs that can be easily administered for a painless death or similar, and tell yourself: \"Eh, not the ultimate problem. No point in doing anything here.\" That would be a pretty deranged response, these things are not mutually exclusive, but the point is to truly and fully appreciate that there is an **ultimate** problem all living things who can conceive of problems on a higher level are faced with, and that is simply making sense of what is true about ethics and why our species has failed to be ethical despite knowing about ethics for thousands of years. I know my answer, I've written about it for years now: Evolution and game theory produces psychopathic traits, because evolution is a domination game. Ethics will not be solved in a meaningful way as long as this problem exists.\n\nAgain, you can make small scale ethical moves, and ethical progress is possible, but it's really like bandaids on an axe wound. Solve the axe(you must first identify that an axe even exists-- which we can't seem to do, that it causes harm-- again, we pretend like it doesn't, that harm is bad-- \"Is there *really* such a thing as bad?\" *sniffs own farts*, etc), and then you *really* solve things. There's just an *actual* diagnosis of reality. But now look at our predicament. Billions of different narratives and values orientations and ontologies and epistemeologies and ethical stances and political stances. So unfortunately this emergency will not get solved in the way an emergency should, but we at least *agree* that it is an emergency. That's one tiny step, but the problem with that is if we don't first agree on the **ultimate** problem(identification, diagnosis), then our solving the emergency is going to look like our little car vacation earlier, leading us into the consequences of ignorance.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629924669,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hac9lp0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pb5730","locked":false,"name":"t1_hac9lp0","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_pb5730","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/pb5730\/what_are_we_going_to_do_about_it\/hac9lp0\/","retrieved_on":1650525329,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Or objectively subjective?\n\nYeah there are all kinds of semantic combinations here, but I don't think we need to over-complicate things at all-- it's not meaningful to say \"Evil is subjective\" when we're talking about facts and the world-- this *implies* that evil is just purely a matter of interpretation, and has no actual meaning that coheres with reality.\n\nThe exact opposite of that is true. So I'd just say \"Evil is objective\". But yes, you can say when describing subjects, something like \"It's true that x person finds y to be evil\", but this only tells us something about 'x person'-- not anything about evil itself, what it is, what it isn't(as a matter of fact).\n\n&gt; However you finding murder to be evil is subjective. Not objective. \n\nIt's not either or. It's true that, as a subject, I find murder to be unethical(not sure I'd use the word *evil* here to capture such a broad range of behaviors-- there are many cases of murder where the perpetrator is simply deeply confused rather than evil), but it's also true that as a subject, I find two and two added to produce four true. Neither of these subjective things have anything to say about the objective nature of evil or mathematical truth. It's simply happenstance that humans can intuit a concept like evil or mathematical truth, and simply *doing* so does not make these things just as brittle as me saying \"Chocolate is the best kind of cake\".\n\n&gt; Murder in of itself is not evil objectively since to another person it might be good.\n\nSo the idea behind this statement, even though you didn't write it, but the idea that is implied here is this:\n\n\"Because people *disagree* about ethical truths, then there must be no fact of the matter about ethical truths.\"\n\nLet's examine how this plays out anywhere else. Imagine two people were arguing about whether vaccines are safe, and you asked, \"Do you think there's a *fact* of the matter about whether vaccines are safe?\" and they just said \"Ehhhh, nope. Vaccines aren't safe or unsafe objectively since to this other person it might be the opposite of what I think.\"\n\nIt's from here just... perplexing, what these people are even *doing*. Mere disagreement doesn't imply some kind of brittle subjectivity, but it *does* imply a fact of the matter exists.\n\n&gt; Is objectivity supposed to be universal or can it be singular? \n\nNot either\/or -- both. But in the ultimate sense, there is a universal objectivity. \n\n&gt; And would our sentience be objective or subjective or objectively subjective due to the subjectivity of the objectiveness that falls in line with the subjective nature of the objective state?\n\nI'm not sure which one of us you're doing a bigger disservice to with that sentence, but one really just has to care about the numerous meanings of words, to appreciate the question you're asking. It's a matter of fact that we're sentient, objectively. It's also an objective description about a subject. I don't see it as being *subjective* in the sense of fact statements-- here we're again speaking in terms of chocolate cake. \"In my opinion, cake is best\"&lt;-- Yup. \"In my opinion, humans are sentient\" &lt;-- Nope. If someone made this much effort to avoid stating a fact, *something* is off here.\n\nNow you're asking about the specific things we perceive, not about human sentience in general. You're asking if the things we perceive would be objective-- well, again, in anything where there's room for there to be a fact of the matter, yes. The things we perceive in those matters would be objective. Ethics is one such description because ethics really relates to a concrete conception, like anything else that describes anything about the world. Ethics has to *do* with something. What ethics has to do with, is not arbitrary. The core characterization of ethics is not toilet plumbing or woodcarving. Notice how that last sentence is **objectively** true? You ask someone, \"What is ethics?\" And they say: \"Well basically, much of ethics has to do with aluminum, and Tahiti.\" Just... what? No. That's not merely subjectively wrong, but that's objectively wrong and objectively bad, as a description.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1629984737,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"haf7kdq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pb4jiy","locked":false,"name":"t1_haf7kdq","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_hadvvqb","permalink":"\/r\/Athkneovism\/comments\/pb4jiy\/ar01_why_is_nature_the_origin_of_all_evil\/haf7kdq\/","retrieved_on":1650511974,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Athkneovism","subreddit_id":"t5_3s94ev","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Athkneovism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I think the first point to acknowledge is that we don't make ourselves. We don't author who we become, or choose what we find pleasurable, or whether we're ashamed about this or not. This doesn't mean it's just a free for all of desires, of course. If someone causes another person real harm, then we just have to protect whoever we can consider a meaningful victim. But it does tell us that moralizing and holding people *ultimately* responsible, and shaming\/blaming\/punishing them with an undertone of \"You really *should* have behaved otherwise!\" is not only harmful but ignores the way reality works. \n\nI think that it's this confusion about ultimate responsibility, the attitude of \"You could have done otherwise\" that causes a lot of unnecessary shame in cases like yours. Again this doesn't mean just sitting down on a playground bench and watching masochistic gore porn on a large monitor because you find it enjoyable and you know you're not responsible for this state of affairs, right? Clearly, that would say something more precise about someone if they did that. But it does mean that what you do in private, as long as it harms no one, as long as you don't have malicious or dishonest or otherwise bad intentions to yourself or others, is not an ethical problem.

So when you ask about \"views on hunting\", that seems to be the broad sense of modern hunting. I think hunting in *that* sense, is unethical because I don't really distinguish it from predatory behavior in general. Our species simply *is* predatory, both towards our own species, and to others. And this is a primary feature of what makes humans so unethical by nature and why we've caused so much harm.\n\n If this sounds dubious to you, or like it requires some real evidence, or it sounds too pessimistic or cynical, then simply imagine going back 1 million years to find the common ancestor of homo sapiens, and with the sophisticated technology of a thought experiment, simply setting this ancestor's 'predatory' dial on our simulation here down to zero(and all future ancestors).\n\nWe ignore the fact that our predatory behavior actually strongly contributed to our rise to fight for niches and dominate every member of our species or similar species, and therefore our total domination of Earth. This is not important for this experiment. So again, humans+pre-humans have **zero** predatory elements now, and we \"press play\". \n\nWhat does humanity look like for the next million years? How does war appear? How does the relatively modern concept of [serial killers](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_serial_killers_by_number_of_victims) function when they have zero desire to \"hunt and dominate\" weaker beings? And most importantly, how much suffering is reduced by cranking a core component of evil behavior down to exactly zero for the immense span of 1 million years-- suffering both in humans and animals?\n\nI think ethics would have flourished much more, if this was the case, and suffering would have decreased. It's true that suffering wouldn't have gone away, because there's still the meat grinder of wild predators. But I don't think it compares with the scope and scale that humans torture each other and animals on our planet, which is why I would assume it would go down.\n\nIntention aside, there could be cases where an animal instantly dies to a hunter's bullet(who is simply entertaining themselves-- let's remember. This is \"fun\" or \"cool\" or \"meaningful\" or \"useful\" for the hunter-- not *ethical*, not a moral duty of some kind). In these cases, we are essentially right by accident, or right for the wrong reasons. But the alleviation here is the animal, in some small set of cases, will have avoided either a slow agonizing death to disease or injury, or a slow agonizing death while being eaten alive. Being shot in the head and instantly killed is simply far better than these scenarios, so this is a tiny silver lining. \n\nOther than cases like that, I think even humans with good intentions could easily pave the road to hell with them if they just \"took up hunting to save wild animals\". I'd personally be cynical of such behavior and assume this person is inventing a fantasy narrative over the very generic and plain human predatory behavior which is likely in them due to millions of years of predatory games.\n\nA fascinating ethical add-on to this would be the question of eating the meat. From a vegan perspective, it's true that purchasing animal products from a huge chain like Amazon-owned Whole Foods is wrong, but there's no issue with just purchasing the plant based product. Sure, one may admit, that they're still supporting some sort of exploitation, huge scales of it, from human workers, to animals, to all the bad arguments people come up with against veganism, but this is far better than the animal products, according to vegan, which pay the evil middleman to eat, but not for the bad product-- for the good product. But now there's an opportunity to pay the evil corporation nothing at all, and simply consume the collateral damage of doing something potentially ethical by avoiding animal misery.\n\nYet I think many vegans would be very strongly opposed to eating the meat of hunted animals in this circumstance. I know a significant number probably wouldn't but many more would. Just a fun side experiment to run, I think, to discover what actually motivate one's dietary ethics.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630052453,"distinguished":null,"edited":1630052718.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"haj6gmv","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pchkn7","locked":false,"name":"t1_haj6gmv","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_pchkn7","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/pchkn7\/views_on_hunting\/haj6gmv\/","retrieved_on":1650494060,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Do you want to know what I actually think? This is marked rant\/vent, and it's a question I've asked myself in some sense for all of my life, so I'll speak up here, but I write about this stuff all the time on other subreddits where this isn't as taboo to say. This is all going to be very depressing, and since this is r\/CPTSD, reconsider continuing to read this if you don't want to get depressed by entertaining this idea. Dark content ahead.\n\nThe question you ask made me develop an early interest in psychology, evolutionary biology, game theory and philosophy, the few fields I think crucially explain what we call \"evil\". First grant that genes are oriented towards making more copies of themselves, no matter how illogical, immoral, or counterintuitive the strategy is. That's the *only* rule-- get the baby into reality, and then make that baby make another baby in the most successful(not most ethical, not most rational, not most in touch with reality-- **none** of this matters, to the genes).\n\nNext, simply consider how many animals have been eaten alive in the last hundreds of millions of years, all of that intense pain. And now imagine all of the suffering caused by humanity, in the last 200,000. This is all the genes being expressed, because it turns out, when the resources are finite, and resource control is related to status and survival, then these will be the organisms that succeed in reproducing.\n\nThis leads to a bunch of evil strategies, like eating something alive which has a nervous system, and is crying in pain, and in intense trauma. This is true for wild animals, and this is true for what we'd informally call a psychopath to describe the most abusive and malicious people who inhabit our species.\n\nAnother feature evolution produces is camouflage, which can get [very sophisticated](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) if you just give it enough evolutionary time. This is a genetic expression, and it's fundamentally not very different from a set of traits that [psychopaths](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cmp43eP.png) and other dangerous human beings have. The way the evolution works here, is an overtly anti-social strategy will only be successful insofar as this being can successfully dominate their environment and avoid being dominated. But if one is so evil that everyone around them says, \"Hey wait a second, this deal isn't worth it. This person's not playing fair, this person is abusive, this person is a liar, this person is sadistic\", then this basically is no longer a worthy genetic strategy.\n\nSo what the genes do instead, is that \"backlash\" against bad people, actually makes bad people *stronger*. This is called \"selection pressure\", because now, only the bad people who successfully slip through the cracks via the psychopathic traits of deception, manipulation, and charm, will get the evolutionary reward. But the overt thugs and sadists, will slowly get reduced with time. So it's like the evolution of that caterpillar that looks incredibly like a snake-- this happens very slowly. First, it doesn't look anything at all like a snake. But maybe 1% closer. A caterpillar is roughly \"tubular\" so, it's not too far off. Maybe a black dot on one end of the tail, and a predator may see it from that side and think it's an eye, and it lives. This slooowwwwwly develops into symmetry which nature seems to favor. So the caterpillar with 2 black dots now thrives slightly better. Over time, the features of the snake become very very pronounced, and only the most snake-like caterpillars survive.\n\nPsychopathy, evil, abusers, whatever term you wish to use, work in identically the same way. This is precisely the opposite of what we're taught about evil from myths, ancient religions, fiction, books, movies, etc. Evil is always this very *overt* thing. Something demonic with horns and sharp teeth and very clearly mean looking. Maybe it's wearing black armor, or it has a red glowing sword. This serves to teach us: \"*This* is what evil looks like.\" But that's nothing at all how evil looks in reality. Evil is very plain. Very unassuming. Evil can be quaint, or docile, or cheerful, or polite, or beautiful, or charismatic. This is a *function* of evil, because evil is synonymous with power. Just imagine something evil that was the least powerful thing in the entire universe. This is by definition, the *least* evil thing in the universe. To be evil without power is an incoherent idea like \"square circle\".\n\nSo camouflage therefore, is a kind of evolved power, as a trait which evil naturally expresses with time, since the \"be obviously evil\" strategy is inferior to the \"be covertly evil\" strategy. We see serial killers brought to life sentences and think, \"Oh good, one less evil person\", but really, in evolutionary terms, this is a kind of \"Failed evil\", which slips through the cracks. The successful evil goes on, just like the snake caterpillar with the best looking snake on its tail, and it thrives, because there is no ultimate referee in our universe. Game theoretically this means that the most successful strategy will be one where one is not bound by rules. Ethics are a kind of 'rule' in game terms-- evil can do anything it wants that appears ethical, but good can't-- by **definition**, since for good to do evil as a part of some long term strategy would no longer make it good-- this is a kind of unfair advantage, strategically.\n\nThe real bad news here is there aren't \"Good people and evil people\" in our species. This is only an illusion that appears when we're *inside* the species. If we could look outside of the species, we would see very gradual layers of evil, because our species comes from millions of years of rape and murder and selection pressure, which created beings who are not only oriented to do evil, but to not realize how they themselves are evil-- this is the way evolution puts the rabbit into the hat, both for the psychopath, and for the average human being who turns a blind eye to the screaming next door. Most people aren't terrible in some relative sense of course, but objectively, the genes inside us motivate us to be very selfish and callous towards others, and our society is structured around this selfishness. This would be much more obvious if we could \"weigh\" all of the selfishness on earth, vs all of the charity. It would be utterly eclipsed, if we could compare them in some visual way.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630132019,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hank5bd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pczkmr","locked":false,"name":"t1_hank5bd","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_pczkmr","permalink":"\/r\/CPTSD\/comments\/pczkmr\/why_is_it_that_abusive_people_just_get_to_remain\/hank5bd\/","retrieved_on":1650473928,"score":13,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"CPTSD","subreddit_id":"t5_2vvid","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/CPTSD","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

This is distinct from any \"conspiracy theory\" out there, because there's not much conspiracy going on. This is simply a naturally occurring process, like osmosis. This is the \"Physics of evil\". \n\nThings organize in hierarchies naturally(you see this simply growing up as a child, if you just pay attention to how kids play in school, and who gets rewarded, and who gets punished), and evil is the best strategy in our universe for doing this. This is why we never *quite* seem to make progress. Many problems seem *so* simple to solve, especially when we're younger. So this is very frustrating to see. We ask ourselves, \"Why!? Why must it be this way? The answer is *so easy* ... Is the world simply stupid?\" We often settle on this answer, because it makes us all feel good. \n\nBut this frustration is mostly born out of a steady diet of human propaganda, which I lump in the vast majority of optimistic human fiction. This includes myths, like the ancient Babylonian Enuma Elish where some \"great hero\" or savior, fights some big evil dragon, and of course wins, and happily ever after, yadda yadda. All the way to things like Star Wars and Marvel movies. It's all the same narrative-- good is the underdog, evil is powerful, but through determination, or magic, or technology, or a rag-tag group of friends, they finally overcome it-- the end :). Pure fantasy, though. Not how it works in real life. This is a kind of hypnotic spell that has been very powerful to the most powerful people who have ruled over humans.\n\nWithout this propaganda, people would see reality how it is. But this is one pillar of the facade that our world is a world of progress, where slowly we're weeding the evil out. It's unfortunately the opposite-- a world where evil only gets stronger and stronger, and there's no actual way to win because the literal **laws** of the universe make evil win in purely strategic terms. You see this in the school bully, you see this in the first world superpowers who destroy innocent people to conquer larger and larger parts of the globe, all while distracting the peasantry with daily bullshit that rots our brains. \n\nPsychopathy is essentially rhyzomatic in humanity. It has a hand in every single field or endeavor humans find themselves in-- Hollywood, Academia, Science, Medicine, Government, Military, Business\/Economics-- all dominance hierarchies, atop of which sits an apex psychopath who is only ever dethroned by happenstance or a greater psychopath. Just pyramidal structures within pyramidal structures of evil, all while lacking self-awareness as a function of their own evil. Another cute strategy by the way, since it's actually more strategically optimal to be evil while not understanding one is evil, than to be evil and be aware-- sort of like a robot AI running out of control, just executing its script to control and torture things. Nothing can convince it, because it cannot even understand what it is, even if it wanted to.

And in the worst cases, which are not terribly rare, it can *increase* the suffering an animal would face in the wild.\n\nSo it doesn't even remotely make sense.\n\n&gt; It also shows how people advancing this argument may not care much or at all about wild animal suffering, but more about the animal products they are used to consume.\n\nYes, very obviously. This is a terrible argument. Anyone who thinks factory farms are justifiable somehow has already forfeited the discussion. The only way to argue against veganism as far as I see, is to point out that there's no a strong relationship( and it appears, not the kind of relationship we want), between what we eat, and what happens to the world. So, veganism has exploded in popularity over the last 15 or so years, yet animal torture has gone *up*, rather than down. \n\nThere's a very simplistic intuition operating here that if people simply stop buying animal based products, those industries will reliably fail. This is not so straightforward, unfortunately, due to all the sinister and unintuitive mechanics of our economy. Less meat consumption can actually paradoxically *increase* meat consumption. Our minds are just not evolved to understand economics very well. We think there's some straightforward, linear movement-- like \"Okay, I've purchased the soy sausage. I've only got plants in my grocery cart. Ahhhhh, one step closer.\" But no. That's **not** how it works in reality(By the way, notice just how emotionally destabilizing this claim would be, **if** it were true, and **if** it were seriously confronted. I could imagine many vegans would be either heartbroken, or it would just be rejected due avoidance of all the negative emotions that come as a consequence, like telling a Christian there is no God. The emotional and psychological cost here is pretty big).\n\nThe cow or chicken or pig out there is *still* getting tortured that day, first of all. Second of all, a few things can happen in macro economic terms. Meat prices can drop, causing lower socio-economic classes to buy more meat. This can either keep suffering the same, or *increase* animal suffering. It's for this reason that I've proposed people coordinate through some kind of viral social media campaign. I imagine a specific animal or animal product gets targeted, and then every single person concerned with animal ethics just bombards social media with some hashtag. No donation required, just a few minutes every day. I think the internet could handle this kind of activism if we straighten out the rules and the method. This way, non-vegans with good intentions can easily get on board and it would be *potentially* possible to see if \"the internet\" could destabilize an animal industry. I think there's already been some good activism in this style, but it's simply *very hard* to get people on board, and the majority of this I think revolves around our social and political exclusivity(vs. inclusivity).\n\nClearly such a strategy would be geographically locked, so for instance we don't need to boycott ducks in Florida-- it's just not that much of a duck-eating culture. This is why choosing which animal product would be important. This is how I imagine effective dietary ethics in practice, since what people actually *eat*(put in their mouths) appears to have either an utterly trivial(again, the visual here is that a lifetime of veganism \"saves\" x animals-- I think that's confused) or zero relationship(and sometimes an ethically negative relationship) to actual animal suffering in the real world-- we're not lions, where there's a direct relationship.\n\nNow, none of this is actually some kind of \"knock down argument\", against veganism. I don't think such an argument exists, where if you got everyone to perfectly intuit everything without bias, then all vegans would somehow say, \"Oh, okay! Guess it's time to just eat meat now!\". There's nothing truly *wrong* with veganism, therefore, and simply a movement that points out the problem of animal suffering is crucial. If the price for that movement standing on two legs is people being a little bit confused about economics, then I think that's okay. It's a very good thing that veganism and vegans exist. The point here is just that it's not the solution people seem to think it is. And from this, the only *actual* argument against veganism is an argument against the behavior of some vegans, and that's not really against vegan*ism*. \n\nA lot of us are much more motivated by the emotions of disgust and the satisfaction of some kind of moral purity where your fellow tribe member is woke or enlightened about being a good person, and then those outside of the tribe are morally unclean or ignorant. This is deeply human behavior, and is one of the mechanics by which religion has functioned for thousands of years. So there's a lot of human suffering and divisiveness and confusion that comes from moralizing people, and vegans also pay a price for the sanctimony of their peers or the feel-good club membership, since this isn't the best way to become in touch with reality.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630159520,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"haom2i1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_owwgor","locked":false,"name":"t1_haom2i1","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_haoczja","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/owwgor\/why_humans_disappearing_from_the_planet_could_be\/haom2i1\/","retrieved_on":1650469178,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/negativeutilitarians","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It's definitely brutal to experience something like this. But it's also worth recognizing that we can't freely think what we want to think(Another way this is said is, \"We can do what we will but we can't will what we will).\n\nWe don't choose our thoughts, our thoughts choose us, even when we're 100% focused and forcing a certain thought(more on this a little later). This is because we don't choose *ourselves*, right? We don't decide the kind of person we end up, because we don't decide where we're born, or to who, or what kind of brain we're given, or what kind of genes, or what kind of life we live that further determines who we are.\n\nYou can test this: Just think of anything you want right now, and do it by force, give it a good effort. Whatever you thought, recognize that you can't be responsible for the fact that you weren't the kind of person who just read this post and thought this was too uninteresting to try. Or thought to yourself, \"This guy sounds like an idiot, I'm not doing this.\"\n\nYou don't choose those conditions any more than you chose to try thinking of something. Then you also don't choose why you found the thing you chose to think about attractive. Why didn't you choose \"Sherlock Holmes\" as your \"think of anything\"? You know what Sherlock Holmes is. The neurons just weren't firing, and that's because you're not sitting there in your head controlling some robot and pouring over the bookshelves of your brain, finding the \"Sherlock Holmes\" section, and pressing \"fire\". The neurons all do that for you, automatically. The \"Awake\" place where senses appear after those neurons fire, is what \"you\" are.\n\nEdit: In case it's not clear, the reason this is relevant here is because there's a certain neurosis in worrying: \"I hate this so much... I can't freely choose the thought I want to think\" that is directly a result of *believing* that we can freely choose. Once you just recognize that all thoughts-- good thoughts, bad thoughts, silly thoughts, profound thoughts-- all kinds of thoughts just bubble up from the brain constantly from one moment to another, then this can be liberating to realize and cause this specific kind of suffering to reduce or go away.

The problem with this line of thinking is we can really use it to link virtually *anything* a human being does(apart from some sort of promortalist endorsement) to being \"inherently natalist\". This isn't a slippery slope but just a consistency problem and the consequences that come from it. Are... social safety nets inherently natalist? Is a functional society inherently natalist?\n\nNotice the answer to energy-- \"Not necessarily in principle, but most likely in practice\" applies nicely to those too.\n\nIs simply eating meals regularly natalist? What about doing anything other than immediately committing suicide? This is the problem we get into when we discover patterns that are technically true(since everything is deeply interconnected and really just the happenstance of us being *in* a society, virtually anything we do will be \"inherently natalist\" in some sense). But when we say something is \"natalist\", I think we really want to not get *too* broad, if we want to be meaningful. \n\nSo for instance, much of Christianity appears to be meaningfully Natalist. The quiverfull movement is Natalist. But... the fact that we have paved roads or have transit systems probably are not natalist in any **truly** meaningful way at least, right? Even though there's a relationship to paved roads and transit and say, various natalist-related causes and events. Renewable energy is maybe more related to natalism than paved roads, but the point is these concepts all orbit each other to a closer or farther degree, and it's not easy where to draw the line, because we sometimes have to do it somewhere, sometimes, to get a coherent answer to a question like \"Is x, related to y, albeit not explicitly directly?\" We basically lose the meaning of words if we stretch things too far even though we're *technically* correct, is the point I'm trying to make.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630163927,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"haovtrs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pd5db6","locked":false,"name":"t1_haovtrs","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_pd5db6","permalink":"\/r\/DebateAntinatalism\/comments\/pd5db6\/is_renewable_energy_inherently_natalist\/haovtrs\/","retrieved_on":1650467954,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"DebateAntinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2872hd","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/DebateAntinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It's just that the way suffering works is, all parties are lacking skill in dealing with suffering, so this causes them to produce more suffering, both in themselves, and in others. This is not just applicable to people with trauma, but also for people who deal with people with trauma. \n\nThis is a human problem, just in case you're beating yourself up over thinking that you're specially broken some how and there's a world of joyous people out there partying, and you're not invited. I know it feels like you are, and I'm not trying to invalidate all the terrible feelings you have that make coherent the very real negative experiences you've had, which absolutely no one should have to go through. But on top of this tragic set of events, we sometimes needlessly suffer because we think we're at fault here(especially when it's something like narcissistic relationships, where someone has been drilling lies into our brains about being at fault as a form of abuse).\n\nThere's also the cultural and societal implication. Suppose someone rejects us, or insults us, or does or says anything to suggest \"you are inferior\". This is how one *feels* as a victim of severe abuse, but this isn't actually reality. In terms of any relationship, subtle like a brush with a stranger, or the opposite of that, there really is something to say for *needing* to be different than how one already is, right now, at this moment, or else one is unworthy. Who exactly are we improving for? The person who wouldn't tolerate us unless we were free from the burden of having suffered abuse?\n\nI see this as similar to someone who would reject someone superficially. Imagine a serious burn victim, who is simply a kind and decent person in every other way, wouldn't wish harm on anyone, and so on-- being rejected as a human being somehow because \"Those burns make them look weird\", and then being devastated by this rejection. Again, I'm speaking about the full range of what we could mean with the word \"rejection\", from the tiniest to the largest. Should this person with burns be *worried* about that kind of person expressing this towards them? It certainly hurts in the immediate-reaction sense, surely, but what happens if we just think it through very clearly and precisely?\n\nWhy would anyone be interested in this kind of person's approval? We don't *hate* them for their reaction, but this is just not a person whose approval we'd want in the first place. The sorts of people we'd want around are the people who would support us even *with* the burns. Even *with* the burdens of trauma. But what happens is, the pain of interpersonal struggles itself clouds our thinking on this subject and we miss\/forget this very important fact, and then needlessly suffer as a result.\n\nWe can plug in every single worry we have this way. You said \"unsuccessful\"-- again, who are we succeeding *for*? We *know* who we are already, and if not, we can do that just through privately examining our own minds. Whose *standards* of success are we operating under exactly? Ours? Or something arbitrary that arises from a superficial society?\n\nI don't think you're a shell of a person, I think you're a person with your own unique wisdom, that no one else has, because no one else is precisely you.

The direct result of those exercises is less identification with thought, and a lowering of the ego. I think psychedelics lower the ego as well by loosening our identity schemes, which is why more and more evidence is appearing of how therapeutic they are(I'm only speaking of the well established psychedelics, like LSD\/Mushrooms).\n\nI agree with you on spirituality, that can all be completely avoided and all of this could be done in a totally secular way.

And then people would be apprehensive around the world to start doing pushups, because \"They don't want to get involved with spirituality\/religion\".

A single article is just not *too* much, for me.\n\nClearly, if we just zoom out from our world, and look at this planet in 2021 full of people who are fucking confused that they're all on this sphere which contains hundreds of millions of years of murder, rape, torture, propaganda, war, domination, bullying-- and a tiny speck of good, we can see that this condition hasn't changed too terribly from ... I don't know, ancient Egypt.\n\nYet our smartest people, both in academia, but particularly just average \"Smart people\", even people who could be called \"rationalist types\", very often pretend as if we *have* figured things out in 2021. Yeah, they'll signal skepticism and all the right bells and whistles for being a good \"in touch with reality\"er, but internally, subconsciously perhaps, there's very often a kind of egomania driving this that says \"I'm so smart, I'm way smarter than you, the world is dumb, we've figured everything out, it's 2021\" etc. Pardon the Freudian sort of description here, and pardon the crudeness, but humanity is still really dumb. Even the smart ones. This is going to sound contradictory to the Dunning Kruger effect for now, but hopefully it won't be a problem later.\n\nI think it's more likely that Dunning Kruger effect exists, because it's far less evolutionarily costly to simply signal intelligence via patterned behaviors and language games, than it is to actually be profoundly intelligent. Now, one can attack this idea a hundred ways, one can either criticize the semantics of \"intelligence\", or one can say what's happening doesn't perfectly, rigidly fit into what we call \"The Dunning Kruger efffect\", or maybe ask if there's a real difference between signalling and being, and so on.\n\nAnother one is the semantics of what we're talking about. So the core anxiety I think that motivates a critique of the Dunning Kruger effect is that it tries to put a halo around who we'd label \"smart people\" and says \"Oh no, they don't believe in themselves\" and basically shits on who we'd call \"dumb people\" and says \"Booo, you think you're way smarter than you are\". In the worst case scenario this hoists up the overconfidence of the intelligent and gets us into the smart ones ruining things( part of why anti-intellectualism exists in the first place, and why intelligence isn't generally considered sexy), while potentially shitting on the next Einstein that we simply interpret as a stupid person with a lot of confidence that they're right.\n\nBut the Dunning Kruger does the opposite of that, if we just appreciate that very often the smart ones will not appear like the smart ones, and this returns to my original post that you were replying to: We're just bad at *really* getting intelligence right. We assume *we've* got it, now, in arbitrary bumfuck year 2021. But it's loaded with our pragmatic values, and lacking in creativity and openness and flexibility. It's the the smart people in the Dunning Kruger effect who will *appear* stupid, and the stupid people in the Dunning Kruger effect who will *appear* smart. This is a kind of meta-problem that I suspect would be a dramatic issue for doing any solid science on, although that's just my suspicion and I can't really speak about scientific studies(Is this the *presence* or *absence* of the DK effect? Far out, maaan).\n\nPeople forget that pragmatic systems like rationality, logic, science, everything we deeply value and *should* value, is a slow system. It is very likely to be shit in, shit out, for a very long time, before it actually grasps reality and produces revolutionary changes that finally dispel the old, antiquated models and theories and thinking schemes.

There's a certain validation I think at least in the dissociation they offer(ego loss-- which is a core mechanic of human misery), because then one can essentially \"reset\" any kind of high pattern-seeking one may naturally be predisposed to. This could be anything from the sorts of social suffering StPD's get, like distrust of others\/social paranoia(perhaps MDMA would be the drug of choice for StPD? Pure speculation on my part, I've never tried it, and purity is always an issue here, particulary in MDMA because it seems to suffer from being cut with the sorts of drugs that StPD's would **not** want, like methamphetamine), or the sorts of visual hallucinations Schizophrenics get. I imagine that some degree of naturally occuring dissociation\/depersonalization\/derealization are *already* present in these \"disorders\" for this reason-- as a way of surviving a chaotic hell of random pattern associations, many of which aren't \"real\"(the patterns *themselves* I think are survival strategies for surviving a hellish world, rather than \"disorders\", even though they clearly cause the sufferer harm often, but that's another subject).\n\nThe same rules I'd say apply in general-- one has to be the adventurous\/brave type. One has to be confident at bare minimum to do this, and have good intentions. If there's serious trauma\/darkness( By darkness I don't mean abuse, but rather... evil traits-- truly malicious dispositions, hatred, etc), those may surface, and these reflected back at oneself are the most psychologically destabilizing. But if one survives this ordeal, one will learn one of the most valuable lessons possible I think, the kind of ultra-profound lesson one may never learn in an entire lifetime. This is why even \"bad trips\" can be \"good trips\", in the long term.

The crucial game to play is the one where we drop our more detail-oriented representations of reality, and just start from scratch, and ask: What is **actually** important in this predicament we all find ourselves in as conscious beings?\n\nSo I'd even be more radical than this-- not just ask, \"How do we optimize what's important\"(perhaps this is just splitting hairs, I'm not sure), but just figure out a way to converge on and ask: \"What *is* important?\" Even basic things, like honesty, truth, ethics-- we just can't seem to agree. Part of this disagreement is that we're very entangled in very different representations of these things. The only solution I can see is valuing some kind of \"reset\", we need to return to square one somehow and just begin again to interpret reality and what matters, because most of us, even the people who are interested in things like progress, ethics, truth, and so on, seem to just be too far down whatever rabbit hole we've entered.\n\nThe problem at this point is I think I diverge a little here in my pessimism and cynicism because I think whatever game emerges from \"what should we value?\" is likely to be bogged down in the same problems that emerge in general for the \"What is true?\" or the \"What is ethical?\" game. These games are all dead ends, and I think it's mostly because our formal philosophical approach(moved by our evolutionary behaviors) have made them so. One can just be infinitely skeptical of even the most basic value, even when this value is inherently contradicted *simply* by participating in the argument.

Repeat. Get stronger. Simple, but not easy), with added philosophical guidance, that achieves insight and orientation towards life, suffering, and death.

Absurdism sort of comes close... but... I think we can do much better. Here's the thing there. It's clear that Absurdism can have a very sophisticated understanding of the problem. Sometimes, it *knows* just how bad things are, or that's the sense I sometimes get. It identifies a kind of futility, so... for instance, if you discovered some kind of sinister truth. Let's entertain the stupidest conspiracy theory possible for a second. Imagine reptiles really *did* evolve camouflage, really *weren't* killed by a meteor, and were an invisible cabal that dominated evolved apes like Homo Sapiens in an analogous way to to how we appear to [dominate and torture bovine species](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3229).\n\nLet's just assume this is true. What could you *do* about this? Truly nothing. You're just doomed. You're doomed in camouflaged reptile hell. You could buy a loudspeaker tomorrow off of reptile-owned Amazon, get it delivered with 2-day super saver shipping, and sit on a roof in a busy city and say:\n\n&gt; \"Hey! Everyone, wake up!

HEY... why is no one listening!? Aren't we all the same fucking species? What is **wrong** with you all? **HELLO?!** Is this thing **on**?!\"\n\nIt achieves nothing, in such a scenario, right? You're simply doomed. You're *just* lizard food, lizard slaves. You are powerless. That's what hierarchy means. Absurdism roughly recognizes this problem, but it's some sort of Daoist \"go with the flow\". Which again, isn't the worst strategy. There are countless far worse strategies, like trying to get involved in left\/right politics, or identifying in **any** way with them. If the left **or** right in the US or any 1st world superpower simply embraced absurdism, I'm confident suffering would decrease dramatically.

That's 100% accurate. But neither will they be better off. They won't BE anything. So your choice is between an unknown quantity of suffering plus an unknown quantity of joy, versus nothingness. It's not a negative versus a positive as the antinatalist would have you believe.\n\nI think the problem is you're inventing a square circle here, and then arguing against it. That's not exactly hard to do, but it's not intellectually honest either. No serious antinatalist ever speaks of \"Non-existent beings\", but it's a good thing that beings are not forced to exist when they don't seem to need to. I think that's all that needs to be understood.\n\nAntinatalism *could* be wrong, who knows. But the current vantage point shows that one is simply throwing gasoline on a fire by bringing children into this world. Let's recount *where* we are exactly. Let's forget everything we know, for the sake of this crucial question, okay? We're starting from scratch. We're dropping our politics. We're dropping our philosophical positions, and we're just *thrown* into this world. What do we see?\n\nJust very fundamentally, we see a world governed by laws. Physics. This determines how matter and energy and forces behave within spacetime. Nothing complex, right?(\"But it's very complex!\", no, not in the broad sense we're trying to paint a big picture in) It determines how these particles move, these rules.  This is the substrate of reality, this is the law from which everything bubbles up from.\n\nNext, we see that matter can arrange in a very unique and interesting way-- it can arrange in a way where the matter itself continues to replicate *itself*. This is carbon based, and a new kind of \"physics\" emerges. A law of how things replicate. It turns out, things need to both gain and spend energy to replicate. This develops things that have DNA, and then just bounce off each other in a soup, expressing strategies for competing for energy, and it *must* be a competition, since resources are finite, and the early bird gets the worm.\n\nNext, we know there's no referee here. We know there's nothing about these laws that interfere in an organism that [eats other organisms alive](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall-rhardcorenature), when it does something we'd call unethical. No living thing would want to get eaten alive. It turns out, it really sucks, and to do it onto something, is a form of ignorance, and unethical behavior. If it turned out **you** were eating something alive, and someone gave you a pill that made you self-aware or oriented towards ethics, you'd fall to your knees, begin to vomit, and probably jab utensils into your eyes until you died, out of shame and guilt. That's the *typical* response to being an ethically oriented thing who processes ethics.(Note: Evolution has developed a neat trick, where it manages to not actually feel shame or guilt in being unethical-- more on that later).\n\nNow that complex beings emerge, these beings aggressively compete, for hundreds of millions of years. [Tons upon tons](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PcnH_TOqi3I) of animals getting eaten alive. Finally, complex language, tool use, and civilization appears. This seems like progress, but really, it's ethical regress. These \"civilizations\" only form [sophisticated strategies](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Child_sacrifice)(Of which, they are hardly even aware sometimes) to dominate and [maximize suffering](https:\/\/medium.com\/lessons-from-history\/the-brazen-bull-worst-punishment-in-history-e96063b741e3).\n\nIt almost seems like the bugs, are features. Self-deception emerges in these higher order of consciousnesses. Psychosis. It turns out, by lying to oneself, one tells better lies. By being delusional in a hellworld, one is better adapted to a hellworld. It's a hellworld **due** to the fact that hellish strategies dominate. Being the thing with power and sharp teeth, well... there's no negotiation, do you understand? You don't get to say anything, you're just [dominated and eaten alive](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall-rhardcorenature). This has been the case for the way these \"enlightened humans\" have [treated animals](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg) as well, not just [how they treated other humans](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/).\n\nWhat explains this phenomenon? Well, just return to the fundamentals. Physics. The second law of thermodynamics(Entropy-- things move from order to disorder, no special college degree or books needed, this idea is simple, right?). There is no referee in this game. Simple. No one appears to get punished, bad people win, good things or benign things get eaten alive, exploited, dominated. Psychology. What are the traits of evil? : \n\n* Domineering: Evil must be domineering. Power-oriented. For evil to be powerless, is incoherent, because evil with zero power can't **do** anything.\n\n* Callous: Evil must *not be able to care* about right and wrong. This is a feature, not a bug. It lets evil be evil. This, and every other trait, will be expressed in a phenotype, encoded in the genes.\n\n* Self-absorbed: Evil inherently says: \"My way, or the highway\". Evil is low in agreeableness according to \"OCEAN\" big-5 personality traits. It simply isn't going to negotiate. It will **force** it's will upon you, and you will generally not like it. If evil spread love and pixie dust everywhere, then this would, again, be incoherent.\n\n* Manipulative: Evil is oriented, quite simply and crudely put, to \"fuck with things\". Evil is always scheming. Always riding the wave of entropy. Always expressing some kind of trait that works in their favor, generally by disrupting everything around them where ever it benefits them(sometimes, even if it doesn't).\n\n* Deceptive: Evil *lies*. Evil is dishonest. Again, feature-- not a bug. Evil lies to **itself**, because to sustain itself, it can't be honest about what it is, because this would be a kind of psychological flaw. Evil thinks either that it is: a) doing nothing wrong(a failure of ethical orientation\/lack of self-awareness), or b) it is \"The good guy\/the deserving one\".\n\n* Charm: Evil is beautiful. Evil is magnetic. Evil draws you in. Evil is [camouflaged](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv), which is a trait that develops in very sophisticated ways over vast spans of evolution time.\n\nInformally, this is not some religious concept, or philosophical concept, but it's an objective description of a type of person we informally call \"a psychopath\". And it turns out, they are perfectly optimized to win the game here on Earth. How could you beat something that is not bound by rules(ethics), when you're a thing that is bound by rules, if the game state is repeated for eons of evolutionary time scales and the strategies are encoded into DNA? You just cannot. Evil will slowly, gradually, thanks to entropy, thanks to game theory, thanks to evolutionary biology, etc, gradually get stronger and stronger with time.\n\nWhat are the implications here? Well first of all, everyone born in this world has some pretty terrible luck(even the \"Lucky\" ones). This is a **bad** place. This is the place where the mechanics of this world only produce [more and more suffering as expression of apex demi-god psychopaths who torture weaker beings for control over space and resources](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KLpM0bo.jpeg). It's the sort of thing they'll never teach you in school, and for good reason(good, not as in ethical, but good as in strategically beneficial).\n\nWhat does it mean, then, to just **mindlessly** bring in more beings here, as an expression of DNA values? Did you think you were reproducing because it's what **you** want? Wrong. It's simply what the DNA wants, or what the dominance hierarchy wants. The question here is ultimately this: Does bringing more things into existence in a frivolous, egocentric, DNA-induced way, produce more suffering than not? This question **has** an answer. Antinatalists simply answer this question in the affirmative.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630299295,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"haw6kpz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pdbwf5","locked":false,"name":"t1_haw6kpz","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pdbwf5","permalink":"\/r\/collapse\/comments\/pdbwf5\/just_say_no_to_antinatalism\/haw6kpz\/","retrieved_on":1650434921,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"collapse","subreddit_id":"t5_2qhw9","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/collapse","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

There's *something* weird that has been going on with r\/AN for quite some time now, and it only became apparent to me during the banning process, where I was banned for *literally* the **opposite** of what I was accused of saying(you can read more about this [here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/pdq4dc\/bad_apples\/).). \n\nI told someone \"You're *not* just a psychopath\" as in, \"It's **not**(&lt;-- when you emphasize a negation in a sentence, the negation becomes the *context* of the sentence's meaning) that you're *evil*\", but they turned this around as me \"Calling another 'member' a psychopath\". Surely, just a misunderstanding right? Easy to clear up by pointing to some grammar. Nope, it turns out. The mod who banned me was \"gathering evidence\"(too much to list, conveniently-- virtually **zero** of this mountain of evidence was provided to me to respond to), and anything I did respond to, including the accusation of calling someone a psychopath, was ignored. \n\nLet's just zoom out for a second in case some of you aren't familiar with me. I more or less write about psychopathy and evil in a philosophical, broad scope, for 3 years now. I more or less describe the world as ruled by psychopathy as a winning strategy, game theoretically and evolutionarily. I run into people every now and then where I go, \"Huh... this person strikes me as malicious. They could have some psychopathic traits\". And this is a level of callousness that basically expresses extreme ecstatic joy towards immense misery towards things that suffer. So, overt sadists, basically. Here's the thing to realize:\n\n**I don't even call these people psychopaths** in some direct way. I don't think I've ever approached such a person with \"You're just a psychopath\" in my entire life, because that would be hilariously futile to do.\n\nSo why on Earth... would I call a random, deeply depressed member on r\/antinatalism, who has expressed zero malice towards me or anyone, who simply is insisting they didn't reach AN through personal suffering, essentially someone who is at **worst** just confused, a psychopath?\n\nIt simply makes **zero** sense. It's not even a conceivable narrative, as a description of my behavior. Yet the AN mods all seem to unanimously agree here. How puzzling, no? If this was some fringe case, the fine, but many other people have been banned in similar draconian ways there. I remember prior to being banned, someone was banned for simply **questioning** veganism. They sounded very intelligent to me, and I didn't agree with them, but thought their points were very unique and interesting. I would have loved a longer conversation with this person.\n\nAfter being banned, they appealed in r\/AskAnAntinatalist later asking why they were banned. I showed my support for them there, and I told them I thought their ban was unfair, and they did nothing wrong other than simply having philosophical discussions. I was banned not long after. Not just from r\/Antinatalism(where I had posted my \"offenses\", but **also** from r\/AskAnAntinatalist where the person who banned me also moderates). This included a three day mute-- so zero ability to send modmail, so an appeal wasn't even possible. What is the purpose of this, exactly? What can it suggest, in the broader context of this story?\n\nBad faith seems to be a core driver for the mod who banned me, and people like UL(I think this is the head mod? Really unsure who is running the show over there). The only way I can make sense of some of these bans, is *insistently* reading what someone writes in the **worst way humanly possible**, and not being open to changing one's mind. Consider what UL wrote about this:\n\n&gt; This is one example of what is a BIG no-no:\n\n&gt; Oldphan: “Do you believe we would be able to sterilize all the animals?”\n\n&gt; Imendahem: “Uh no. Extermination is the only practical method. It’s just a harm to sit there and pretend you can find some benign way to get the job done. If you want to stop the pregos you got to stop the pregos.”\n\nWhat does this even *mean*? Are they speaking philosophically? Are they entertaining thought experiments? Do they think they're actually some part of some genocidal resistance movement? None of that is **crystal** clear. You have to have some sort of orientation to **push** you along, to lead you to certain conclusions. And if you have **worst** possible intentions in the form of seeing the people you are observing as \"enemies\", or ideological opponents, or members of \"The other tribe\", or otherwise some sort of extreme bias, you **will** find the worst possible interpretation. You just will, that's how the human brain works. And this is what appears to be happening over at r\/AN, which is quite worrying. I've contributed a lot on that sub, and have been very well received there in general, but the mods need to seriously shape up or wake up, because they're asleep right now, at best.\n\nIf you're still confused, and are 100% committed to only what is true regardless of what your prior ideology or biases tell you, simply play along in this little experiment. Just open yourself to be surprised. Commit to **total** honesty, as if God has a gun to your head. Now the exercise is very simple: What is the **difference** between interpreting the following with the **best faith** possible, vs. the **worst intentions** possible:\n\n&gt; Oldphan: “Do you believe we would be able to sterilize all the animals?”\n\n&gt; Imendahem: “Uh no. Extermination is the only practical method. It’s just a harm to sit there and pretend you can find some benign way to get the job done. If you want to stop the pregos you got to stop the pregos.”\n\nNo need to answer this post, just do this little test in the privacy of your own mind to see just how far being biased can take someone to dramatically different positions.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630302701,"distinguished":null,"edited":1630304713.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hawbjck","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pdq4dc","locked":false,"name":"t1_hawbjck","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_pdq4dc","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/pdq4dc\/bad_apples\/hawbjck\/","retrieved_on":1650434292,"score":13,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It's just on repeat-- forever. A losing game.\n\n&gt; My point is it's a suvivor bias. We've never heard anything about those Sisyphus who reject life (either kill themselves or live an ascetic life) We only know about those Sisyphus who keep on pushing and image himself happy.\n\nSurvivor bias is certainly a real thing, but it doesn't necessarily mean its wrong. Also we *do* hear about ascetics, to some degree, and they have some very interesting things to say too(even the worst cases could be construed as a kind of survivor bias).\n\nIf we look at the real world, then it's not perfectly comparable to Sisyphus, since there's an interruption in consciousness. Maybe that's what happens to Sisyphus, too, if he just crushes himself under the boulder. Not knowing why you're tortured maybe enhances the torture. If you know why(ie, the Gods are megalomaniac sadists), you can come to terms. But if you don't then you just get tortured on repeat. Sort of like how most conscious experience on Earth has been expressed.\n\n&gt; Camus said life is absurd then went ahead to have 2 children.\n\nYes, well, this is a point of criticism towards absurdism or the adjacent nihilism. If it's all just a circus where nothing matters, then anything seems to go. This is why I do not subscribe to both absurdism and nihilism. Words really do have meaning, as far as I can see. \"Good\" means something. \"Good\", doesn't mean Sisyphus pushing the boulder forever and just suffering endlessly. Not as a matter of opinion, but objectively, in terms of the actual meaning of words in a way that *actually* coheres with reality.\n\nAbsurdism to me is like the Western version of Daoism. Just \"go with the flow\". It can work, as a strategy.

But we'd be missing the bigger point, I think. Because it's not just the Human problem.\n\nTo explain this, let's speak about an *actual* human problem: How humans think. And it's really **only** humans, as far as we know, that do this, so it really seems meaningful to call this a \"human problem\".\n\nThis problem is, we are not very good at looking at things broadly. As a species. You can see this in various cultural and political cliches. \"Money is the root of all evil\". \"Capitalism is the problem-- everything's fine, humans are good, just blank slates, tarnished by the evils of capitalism\". \"Religion is the root of all evil-- the opium of the masses, it's actually this specific cult-like orientation that **billions** of us the world over have, that contributes to our failure to make progress\". And so on.\n\nAnd they're not wrong. It's true, money has created staggering inequality. Capitalism has countless dystopian elements to it. Religion is, to some very significant degree, a collective psychosis that amplifies human misery.\n\nBut this doesn't quite *capture* the core problem. How can we know that though? Well, just [take a look](https:\/\/gfycat.com\/welldocumentedpracticalgadwall-rhardcorenature). Do you see anything [wrong](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PcnH_TOqi3I) with this? Could this perhaps be not the [**perfection** of ethical strategies?](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=106)\n\nWhere's the money that's poisoning this? Where's the evil Capitalism that causes animals to eat each other alive. What system is causing sentient beings with nervous systems screaming in pain? Where are the religions to motivate these animals to do awful things to each other like many pop-culture atheists sometimes suggest?\n\nNowhere to be found. And this is because the **core** problem isn't money, or Capitalism, or religion, or anything human-centric. The problem is much broader. The **physics** of our world, causes a hellish environment. The game theory. The evolutionary biology. The fact is, we have **finite** resources. Okay, well... maybe that's fine? What's so bad about finite resources? We can just split these resources up for everyone, right? Win win?\n\nNo, unfortunately, and that's because **genes** are the machinery that keeps this show running. The only reason the \"lights are on\" for any being alive on Earth, is due to **Deoxyribonucleic acid**. Woah, what's that? Nothing too fancy, it's simply a molecule, which we call DNA, in which, is **encoded** a set of strategies and traits, which are then expressed onto one's environment, which are then modulated by said environment.\n\nStill too complicated? Think of \"code\", like a computer. Basic instructions, like \"boot\", and so on. That's what the genes are doing. Right? So now what **determines** how these genes express themselves? Well, simply put-- **whether or not they replicate**. If the gene survives, that's good for the gene. If the gene dies, game over for that specific gene. What happens if you introduce **lots and lots of time** here, is certain **strategies** emerge, that promote this gene from making another copy(in humans, sexual reproduction-- making babies, and having those babies \"thrive\"-- whatever that means)? You get [very sophisticated strategies](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) that are all trying to [win the game](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/) via domination + deception.\n\nSo why can't a win-win strategy emerge? Why not a good strategy? Well, simply put-- win-win doesn't **win** as much, as **dominate everything through covert psychopathic and psychotic hierarchical rape**. That second strategy is a real doozy. No gene can quite figure out how to beat that strategy. You either [lose to it](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg), or you join it, or you become more dominant than it by *using* it. Those are the only possible moves in this game(Sounds like the *shittiest* game anyone ever invented, huh? Who on Earth would willingly play this game?).\n\nSo, it sounds circular or tautological, but \"Be the winningest winner possible\" is the winning strategy. And that means be the most powerful thing possible, by definition. So that's what the DNA is *doing*. It's slowly perfecting this strategy. And that's our world today. If you just look around you and wake up to see [what is happening](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KLpM0bo.jpeg), drop all of your political bullshit, drop all of your biases, and just look **only at the facts**, you will see this expression of DNA, looking to dominate, because domination **means** replication. The strongest thing is the sexiest thing in the universe, to the DNA. And how do you stop the DNA? Well, you can't because they are \"piloting a robot\" expressing the genetic values of \"Strongest thing\". So you have to be stronger, by definition, to beat the DNA. And to do that, you need to basically be an evil superpower. What I'm saying is you can only lose to various degrees in this universe: you can't really \"win\" without losing, because the rules of the game favor evil strategies.\n\nThis is why I wouldn't personally say \"The human problem is constant\", but rather, \"The problem that burdens *humanity* is constant\". Just a small distinction, but it captures the broad problem rather than seeming as if humanity is uniquely the source of why the world is so hellish(despite holding the Olympic Gold medal in the event of causing sentient beings misery and torture for thousands of years now).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630308833,"distinguished":null,"edited":1630309471.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hawj8hl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pce5vm","locked":false,"name":"t1_hawj8hl","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_pce5vm","permalink":"\/r\/Athkneovism\/comments\/pce5vm\/ar02_is_the_human_problem_a_constant_or_is_it_a\/hawj8hl\/","retrieved_on":1650433338,"score":4,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Athkneovism","subreddit_id":"t5_3s94ev","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Athkneovism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

So I subscribe to the idea that it seems to be wrong to bring things into a fairly hellish existence where death and pain are inevitable, without the possibility of consent, for egomaniacal reasons, **and** the idea that a socioeconomic system that organizes itself around the forced drudgery and misery of billions of the most sentient animals on Earth(humans), is unethical.\n\nI constantly raise objections on Anti-work, I say things like \"Capitalism is not the problem\", I defend CEO's sometimes when I see criticism of them being unfair or maliciously motivated(although I don't spare them criticism since I believe all prominent CEO's must, by definition be to some significant degree psychopathic, as a function of evolution and game theory. One just can't \"win\" such a high profile game being \"the good guy\"-- that's a Hollywood fantasy idea, not reality.)\n\nBeing anti-political, doesn't help me here, since all political orientations tend to see me as an enemy. So any time I utter some sort of taboo here on Anti-work, naturally I'm down-voted into oblivion from time to time, but I've never actually had more than maybe one issue here( I think around 2 years ago a Mod tried to start something with me, but I think they were the power-tripping sort with lots of other members and are no longer a mod).\n\nBut yeah, just weird, and the opposite of what I'd expect. Anyway, the problem is tribalism. Every subreddit around a unique ideology is a tribe. Anti-work is one tribe, with a loose collection of adjacent philosophies. The same with AN. What humans do, is they strive for tribal cohesion, and this is an expression of genes and traits that favored the tribes of our ancestors in dominating the tribes they dominated(Just close your eyes and imagine the scope and scale of human murder, torture, tribal warfare, tribal sexual violence, etc-- in the last 200+ thousand years. The winners of **that** game, are what we are, genetically.). \n\nTribes signal the standard echo-chamber type memes, but they also fight amongst each other. And then the winner dominates in a hierarchical system and forces tribal cohesion onto the group. This is the strategy that has been unconsciously expressed by the \"winner\" humans in history(on multiple levels, think both big and small scale), and this is happening constantly, on reddit, on Earth, in families, in friend circles, etc. It's a brutal and unethical system. It doesn't care about right or wrong, it doesn't care about truth. It's just about a power struggle, and then signaling the acceptable language of the tribe.\n\nAntinatalism is in the precise situation that Anti-work is in with it right now. There are philosophies that AN deems \"too taboo\" and tries to not associate with(or directly fights with), which associates itself with Antinatalism. It's **purely** a game hairless monkeys like ourselves play to acquire power, to form big groups, to acquire ideological purity(even at the cost of being delusional). If you look at history, this is what you'll see. If you look at the present, this is what you'll also see(to a lesser\/greater degree). If you were wondering why I said I'm \"Anti-political\", *that's* more or less why. I'm strongly averse to all the hive-mind, circle-jerking, cookie cutter bullshit. I think people should think for themselves, not form groups(or at least not *identify* as group members-- this is the lifeblood of bias), and discuss ideas in and of themselves with some sort of bias or tribe or \"bad guy\" that holds the opposite idea that they're fighting.

So the discussion is long walks on the beach, how positive they can be, and potentially even extraordinarily sublime with a mild\/moderate dose of LSD. But then Andres warns *unless* \"you're prone to psychosis\". My mind just went there right away and wondered what does that even mean, and then to the big picture of what we call \"psychosis\".\n\nFirst I imagined the beach. I imagined someone taking a psychedelic, on a deserted beach, and just calmly walking. Perhaps being captivated by something like the Ocean would trigger something deeply bad. Or perhaps some other pattern emerges. Whatever, now it's a full blown bad experience. What would it mean? Some pattern would need to be recognized. All the alarm bells of \"bad\" would be ringing for this person, having such an experience. Anxiety, fear, dread, etc.\n\nIt's not that this person recognized a *good* hallucination, it's specifically the *bad* patterns we tend to immediately think of when we say the word \"Psychosis\". But we label 100% of these patterns as psychosis. Anything that is a) bad and b) deviates from the status quo, is to us a psychosis.\n\nBut there's no guarantee that 100% of these patterns are not in touch with reality. Some tiny percentage of these patterns will actually correctly identify reality in a way that baseline human neurochemistry does not. The difference between the two, is human sensory experience is adapted to human environment. We're bipedal because that's what has worked. We see the way we do, hear, smell, think(or fail to), for specific reasons thus far.\n\nThis does *not* mean that a sober human is actually \"in touch\" with reality. It just means that a sober human is, through the pragmatism of evolutionary time scales, squeezed into certain strategies for survival. But with psychedelics, one can discard much of this, and it's like pulling the lever on a slot machine with gradations of positive or negative prizes. Some of them will be real prizes, others will be fake prizes with no actual payout.\n\nBut the point is, we just ignore the fact that these real prizes, particularly the negative ones, exist, and are accessible. And we dismiss them very often, both in ourselves, and especially in others, as psychosis. This is part of our pragmatism. I think it's *these* sets of information that are the most important and daunting problems in reality, and the first problem is we are averse to accessing them, we are unable to identify them in others when they discover them. I focus on the negative ones, because they really do make a mockery of the positive ones when the two are apposed. The \"good life\" or \"peak blissful experiences\" etc are just not coherent in the presence of hellish realities. But it does not work the other way around. This is the asymmetry between good and bad. Hellish realities *are* compatible with superficially, subjectively, good lives, or moments of bliss.

You can get it prescribed, or purchase it illegally with ease. Just like the Nazi's ran on speed, to sustain our psychopathic world these drugs seem to go hand in hand. And I have a personal theory just from the people I've met in life, that the people who really are strongly drawn to speed or coke, are noticeably higher in psychopathic traits. They're more self absorbed, they're more callous, more narcissistic, more sadistic, etc. To some degree it's the sort of person that's causing the attraction, but it works the other way too, which causes a feedback loop. The drugs seem to reliably turn people **into** assholes(at best).\n\n\"WOOOOOoooooOOOOOOOOOOO LET'S FUCKING *GO* BAAAABYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\" &lt;-- Is the general spirit of this, familiar sounding? As a character trait? As a feature of very specific types of people? This manic, completely fucking narcissistic, self-absorbed, drug-addled behavior?\n\nYeah, that's the coke you mentioned, and I don't think I've ever heard a deeply kind, deeply considerate, highly ethical, human being ever express this sort of shit. This is like... baseline Tom Cruise levels of psychopathic intensity. This is how go-getters like Jeff Bezos feel, on the inside, every day. This is Charlie Sheen, winning. This is the spirit of the psychopathic system that organizes our world. To achieve this, it's really just about being an inhuman juggernaut of stimulant-induced focus and workaholism that just never runs out. Always fucking scheming, pacing, executing, doing, dominating. Nike, just do it. Harder. Better. Faster. Stronger.\n\nOr... just no? Just stop. Don't \"just do it\". Do nothing, in fact. Turn the bass down. Start tip-toeing at all times, pay close attention to how your foot just softly settles on the floor. Set that cup down as gently as possible, as if a baby is sleeping in the room. Just relax. Close your eyes and breathe in slowly and deeply, and exhale slowly. If you've never tried weed, maybe try some of that. Not every day. Just once in a blue moon to roll the dice on discovering another state of mind. Go in the wilderness on a sunny day and eat 3.5 grams of mushrooms and re-consider who you are, exactly, and be ready to be mortified.\n\n\"Don't act-- just think\" -- a title of a Slavoj Zizek video.\n\nThis is an apolitical problem, it exists broadly in humanity. You find these people in every possible identity group you can think of, and they're not rare, they just express themselves differently to fit into the status quo of their ecosystem. The reasons psychopathic and narcissistic types are obsessed with work, constantly getting things done, constantly in some routine, constantly constrained by schedules, constantly looking to pick a fight, looking for some form of **stimulation**(hence, the orientation to stimu**lants**) and so on, seem to be partly so, because if they just stopped, turned off the engine, sat down, closed their eyes, they would be faced with the reality of what their mind is like. This is related to why I think psychopathy-leaning and low self-awareness go hand in hand. It's an inability to reflect as a function of what one is. If they reflected deeply and honestly for a few minutes to really understand what their minds are like, they would either vomit or just be terrified asking \"What... the fuck... am I... even?\"","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1630358415,"distinguished":null,"edited":1630358869.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"haz88k5","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pei423","locked":false,"name":"t1_haz88k5","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_haxyoeg","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/pei423\/any_thoughts_on_this_gem\/haz88k5\/","retrieved_on":1650421625,"score":20,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

There's currently no fleshed out philosophical position which says turning off *all* the machinery that causes conscious beings would be a good thing-- other than Efilism, which comes the closest. Promortalism says *death* could be good(in certain contexts, or in general), but this doesn't expand on the possibility of consciousness surviving death. Efilism just identifies the mechanics of life(Which if we're speaking about Earth, means DNA) and the ethically salient variable of life(consciousness) as the core ethical problem, to which an ultimate solution would be a permanent shutdown.\n\nI think the points you raise are a concern that a more sophisticated Efilism should take very seriously and is compatible with, but I don't think we'll ever be in a position to \"Push any red buttons\". So I'm really just more concerned with discussing what is it *exactly* that makes our universe\/reality\/multiverse(Whatever you wish to call it), bad. And I think Efilism comes very close to identifying that by pointing to DNA. \n\nDNA is like a catastrophic AI program run amok, which you can't reason with or communicate with. Its only concern is making more copies which are embedded in the domination machines we call Homo Sapiens and any other animal or species or being that could exploit them. And if you try to kill it? It will only get stronger, because this is simply you applying selection pressure to it. This fact *alone* means that any conscious thing that appears in our universe(not just Earth), will find themselves in a hellish world.

So, don't be hard on yourself there, for starters.\n\nNext recognize that there's a reason why you wouldn't just have sex or even behave in certain suggestive ways while you're in a long term relationship with someone who, we're assuming, would probably not be super thrilled about it, right?

It's totally self-absorbed and cruel to the other person who most likely cares about you.\n\nSo again, it's not about *not* thinking in sexual terms towards whoever you're attracted to, since again, this is human, but it's about being aware that acting on those thoughts causes both you and your partner harm.\n\nThis doesn't mean, \"Don't make any friends\", of course, you should still socialize if you want to, right? That's deeply human too.
