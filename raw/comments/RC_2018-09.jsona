I'm asking you to simply follow the incentives and money, to understand why the taboo of death exists.\n\nConsider this fact: We don't even allow the *elderly* , those whose bodies are rapidly deteriorating into piss and shit factories, with failing memories, causing misery to all parties close to these people, and a slow, painful, confused, undignified death. We don't even allow that. I'm asking you to wonder why that is the case.

Just like it's also possible to be in poor health, and financially unstable, and it actually being correct to not commit suicide. It's hard to be certain it's right, but I think the core mindset should be as clear minded as possible, which is very difficult while under depression.
