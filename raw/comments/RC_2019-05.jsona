Let's understand how this works with the force you think you're free to be aware of: **Gravity**.\n\nPrior to reading a discussion on free will, you were completely unaware of gravity, much like I was completely unaware prior to reading the word \"Gravity\" as I read your message. With due time, I again, became completely unaware. At what moment? If you return to two sentences ago, at the precise moment where I typed \"your message\", gravity was just not in the picture for me. I was totally unaware of it -- taking it fully for granted. This is the default state of human consciousness. The only time we think of gravity, is when it is the subject of our experience. How does it become the subject of experience? If you can understand this problem, you will understand how you're not **free** to be aware of gravity.\n\nOnce you stop reading this message, at some point, you will return to your default state - unaware of gravity. When will this happen? Will you choose it? No. You will simply forget gravity exists, as you do, in the vast majority of your conscious experience. Could you choose not to forget? When are you free to be reminded of it? A cause has to trigger this to be brought into awareness. You don't **author** the thought, you don't summon it like some kind of command. It *appears* to you, at the mercy of the void that is your mind. This appearance could manifest itself in a way that seems exactly like an authored command. This is why we say \"The **illusion** of free will\".\n\nYou could say, \"Look. I will choose to not forget about gravity\", and then go on to repeat the word gravity until you get tired or believe you've proven the point. Or you could believe the whole thing is silly, and that it's obvious that you have free will, and that you need not prove anything. All of these alternatives arise from forces outside of your control. You could try to exercise more \"free will\" to escape this, and reassure yourself that the precious ego with all it's pride is not about to self-destruct, by telling yourself something like: \n\n\"I may be getting tired of saying the word Gravity to prove a point, not just tired but deeply uncomfortable at this point... but... I must go on, to prove that I'm free to not forget that gravity is operational\" \n\nor \n\n\"Normally I would say this is silly, but I'm going to choose to go against what my personality would predict of me here, to *truly* prove my freedom\".\n\nDoes this give you freedom? Of course not. Just more determined causes, which say something about your personality, more than they say anything about your freedom.\n\nThe omniscient computer in your example is not an example of any freedom whatsoever, only a deterministic feedback. Causes determine it's actions, it's actions determine causes, causes determine it's actions. The more closely and honestly you inspect this problem, it will become more and more clear: Zero freedom to be found.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1556712055,"distinguished":null,"edited":1556712316,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"em7tf7d","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bixgui","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_em7r96j","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/bixgui\/on_free_will_an_argument_for_determinism_and_its\/em7tf7d\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1559413473,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

A computer is a temporally bound thing, like a person, so they exist in an illusory \"present\". It's still unclear what you're trying to say here. If a computer knows all states, it knows all states, including it's own. It must then act out this \"state\" according to it's programming. This feat is deterministic. Humans are no different from this computer with the only exception being an *ignorance* of all variables. Again, purely deterministic as well, with zero freedom. Only programming, and limited variables.\n\n&gt;I think that being 'consciously aware of' (in the moment) is different than \"being blind to\" - to me the latter means 'being unable to see'. You and i are able to see it so we are not blind to it. \n\nIf you're unaware of it at any given moment, you're blind to it in that moment, Right? Blindness need not be permanent.

They are the machinery that gives rise to the feeling that you're a \"you\" to even ponder the question. Likewise, your microbiome has effects on your personality, since they give rise to various neurochemicals which influence what you call \"you\", but these flora(and fauna, sometimes :( ) are not you. They're inside you, but again, they're not some sort of committee you appear before to make decisions. Likewise, with the cases I raised earlier, brain parasites(which can literally make you go completely insane or increase your risk taking or various other behavioral changes), or brain tumors(which again can radically change behavior in ways we'd describe someone to be \"Not themselves\").

Children and teens compete and bully each other and strive for dominance as they work up to adulthood. The way male children and teens express this, fits into the internet fairly well. Males can \"bully\" other people via simulation, in video games to get some of their stress out. Sexual frustration is remedied to some degree by endless pornography. Girls however, are forced to play the social media game. Upload pictures. Sit there waiting for likes. Gossip, instead of being bottlenecked by real time socializing between girls in the pre-internet time, happens at monumental speed given the viral, real-time nature of the internet. Internet\/social media appears to be *especially* brutal and psychologically unhealthy for girls, thus the massive spike in self harm and suicide for girls. Boys also suffer very significantly, but girls suffer more than 3x as much according to the data.\n\nWhat I think about this is... it could be true, but the core problem is DNA, not social media.

Another chance to see someone get mangled by a train!\"\n\nAnd later says, \"It's a pity I couldnt run over both tracks with a train, and see six people get manged\", frowning, then that says something very specific about the person. Clearly we can't call that person a hero. They were acting ethically, but only by accident.\n\nHowever, a pro-social psychopath could be more concerned saving 5 people but, as a kind of psychological collateral or silver lining, take pleasure from murdering someone. I think here we'd be making some headway towards ethics.\n\nAt this point it comes to my attention that the intentions beg further questions. Why is the psychopath concerned about saving 5 people? Is he simply a pro-social psychopath who wants to enjoy the fame and status of being a hero? Does he suffer from some sort of brain-partitioning which makes him deeply concerned about innocent people losing their lives on some sort of philosophical level, only unable to feel empathy for people who do?\n\nI get the sense that follow-up questions of that sort have some important part to play in the ethics of the situation.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1556791386,"distinguished":null,"edited":1556814606,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"emaxig2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bjesn8","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_emaw63r","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/bjesn8\/the_case_of_the_moral_pervert\/emaxig2\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1559466690,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Do your best to channel this emotion into a different emotion: Bewilderment.\n\nInstead of being angry, be amazed. What a *crazy* and utterly insane and mindblowing feat it was that you got such abusive psychopaths as parents? All we can say is...\"Wow...\". Imagine if you had to slowly discover that people didn't raise you, but instead great white sharks were your parents. How insane would that be? But of course, it makes complete sense. Those cold black eyes couldn't have possibly shown love... that's for humans to do, not sharks. We had the bad luck of getting sharks.\n\nBut yeah, just remember.

Zero undetermined factors.\n\n&gt;b : enjoying civil and political liberty. *'free citizens'*\n\nActions involving neuroanatomy, psychology, environment, genes, etc, outside of ones control . Political views are specifically determined by big 5 personality traits, peer-group, geography, spacetime, etc. Example: A democrat is not free to become a republican and vice versa, they are at the whims of causality to become the sort of person, and meet the sort of stimulus that successfully changes their mind on such a view.\n\n&gt;c : enjoying political independence or freedom from outside domination. *'This is a free country.'*\n\nSee above.\n\n&gt;d : enjoying personal freedom : not subject to the control or domination of another. *'You are free to do whatever you want.'*\n\nYou are not free to want what you happen to want(Certain foods, certain experiences, certain sexual partners). What you want is decided for you, again, by: 1) upbringing, 2) genes 3) environment 4) personality 5) happenstance.\n\nNo desire is freely chosen.\n\n&gt;3a : not determined by anything beyond its own nature or being : choosing or capable of choosing for itself. *'a player free to negotiate a contract with any team'*\n\nEverything is determined by things beyond it's own nature or being. For it not to be, it would by definition have to exist in a vacuum. The irony is, even this would not be sufficient for freedom, because causality would exist inside the vacuum, and the vacuum itself would causally implicate the thing inside it. You would need non-causally bound will to have a \"free will\".\n\n&gt;b : determined by the choice of the actor or performer. '*free actions'*\n\nThink about this one long and hard. If the actor and performer's choices are determined, this is not a meaningful definition of freedom. And choices are in fact determined, by preferences and unconscious impulses. Preferences are determined by 1) Culture 2) Genes 3) Upbringing 4) you get the picture...\n\n&gt;c : made, done, or given voluntarily or spontaneously. *'gave his free consent'*\n\nNothing made, done, or given is undetermined, therefore nothing made\/done\/given is voluntary. The 'voluntary' comes from the illusory story that appears in consciousness, mapped over deterministic reality.\n\n&gt;4a : relieved from or lacking something and especially something unpleasant or burdensome. free from pain. a speech free of political rhetoric \u2014often used in combination. *'error-free'*\n\nNot a relevant context with to free will, unless one is saying one is \"free will-free\", in which case this would be accurate.\n\n&gt;b : not bound, confined, or detained by force. '*The prisoner is now free.*'\n\nEverything a conscious creature does is bound, confined, or detained by the forces of causality which 1) they do not control 2) they are unconscious to. No freedom to be found.\n\n&gt;5a : having no trade restrictions. *'duty-free imports'*\n\nNot a particularly interesting context when talking about free will.\n\n&gt;b : not subject to government regulation. *'free competition'*\n\nNot a particularly interesting context when talking about free will.\n\n&gt;c of foreign exchange : not subject to restriction or official control\n\nNot a particularly interesting context when talking about free will.\n\n&gt;6a : having no obligations (as to work) or commitments. *'I'll be free this evening'*\n\nA determined, illusory willingness to perform determined thoughts and behaviors. Not actually describing freedom.\n\n&gt;b : not taken up with commitments or obligations. *'a free evening*'\n\nAs above.\n\n&gt;7 : having a scope not restricted by qualification.  *'a free variable'*\n\nThe will very blatantly has a scope which is restricted by the qualification that it is free.\n\n&gt;8a : not obstructed, restricted, or impeded. *'free to leave'*\n\nThe will is constantly obstructed, restricted, and impeded by everything other than the set of determined thoughts, behaviors, choices, and decisions it deterministically dances to. You are a slave to leave, or you are a slave to stay, and either outcome will be determined by factors outside of your will.\n\n&gt;b : not being used or occupied. *'waved with his free hand'*\n\nThis definition is particularly interesting, not because of the sentence example, because obviously all decisions move appendages are determined, but specifically in regards to the will itself. What would it mean for your will to \"Not be in use, or occupied\"? Your will is in use, or occupied, when it is engaged and driven by forces. What are these forces? You guessed it, causality outside of your awareness and control, with a veneer of one's ego steering everything like a driver. \n\n&gt;c : not hampered or restricted in its normal operation\n\nThe precise opposite of the quality of the will.\n\n&gt;9a : not fastened.  *'the free end of the rope'*\n\nThe will, and consciousness, is fastened to causality outside of one's control and awareness.\n\n&gt;b : not confined to a particular position or place.    *'in twelve-tone music, no note is wholly free for it must hold its place in the series\u2014 J. L. Stewart'*\n\nIn this sense, the will is confined to spacetime among other things. But the most relevant is spacetime, as far as position\/place goes. Your will cannot operate outside of it's spacial-temporal smearing - to which it is a complete and utter slave. (Example: You cannot think before you were born. You cannot think after you're dead. You can write a letter to someone alive a hundred years from now, but your will is not operational 100 years from now, assuming you are dead. Confined vs. Not Confined to a position or place.)\n\n&gt;c : capable of moving or turning in any direction. *'a free particle'*\n\nWills don't really move or turn - not relevant.\n\n&gt;d : performed without apparatus. *'free tumbling'*\n\nNot relevant.\n\n&gt;e : done with artificial aids (such as pitons) used only for protection against falling and not for support. *'a free climb'*\n\nNot relevant.\n\n&gt;10a : not parsimonious. *'free spending'*\n\nNot relevant.\n\n&gt;b : outspoken. *'is free in his criticism'*\n\nAh hah! This is a *fascinating* context, because free here is **another way of saying determined**. Much like a waterfall is \"free flowing\", or one \"Freely vomits their lunch\". Have we found free will at last?!? The will is \"free\"(determined) to vomit it's determined programming. If **this** is what compatibilists are calling free will, the compatibilists of the world owe everyone a fucking drink or five.\n\n&gt;c : availing oneself of something without stint. *'she's very free with her money'*\n\nSimilar to above, the key words here are \"without stint\". The \"without stint\" is what prevents freedom. The will doesn't just avail itself without stint, it is **doomed** to avail itself without stint.\n\n&gt;d : frank, open\n\nNot really relevant to the will.\n\n&gt;e : overly familiar or forward in action or attitude. *'a young man who had been much too free with the ladies of the town\u2014 Harvey Graham'*\n\nNot particularly relevant.\n\n&gt;f : licentious. *'inexcusably free talk before the ladies'*\n\nNot relevant.\n\n&gt;11a(1) : not united with, attached to, combined with, or mixed with something else : separate. *'free ores.' 'a free surface of a bodily part'*\n   (2) : freestanding. *'a free column'*\n\nThe will is chained to causality.\n\n&gt;b : chemically uncombined. *'free oxygen' 'free acids*'\n\nNot relevant.\n\n&gt;c : not permanently attached but able to move about. *'a free electron in a metal'*\n\nAnother contender? Freedom at last?! I'm waiting for those drinks, compatibilists.\n\n&gt;d : capable of being used alone as a meaningful linguistic form.

Our value is that we provide traffic, and we are paid for this, a tiny amount, which would add up slowly based on how much of our time we devoted to a website. 2)Using any service would result in being paid. You are a loyal user of that service, the service provider cannot function without it's user base, and pays it's userbase a small fee based on activity. This includes things like video games. Currently, these video games parasitize it's user and demand it's user to pay. But it could just as easily be the other way around in a more pro-human system. 3) You would be paid to be a citizen of the country you belong to. Without it's citizenry, a country cannot survive. It cannot have a work force. It cannot have a population for sustaining it's economy. This is a way of saying \"Thank you for being our citizen.\" 4) You know those emails you get asking you to take a survey? Sometimes these emails even say something like... \"And you'll be entered in our lottery to win &lt;some bullshit prize, gift card, etc&gt;\" Those surveys would instead say \"Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to give us this data we're after.

If you're convinced by the fact that you or someone is having the time of their life right now, or if someone is experiencing some kind of ecstasy or epiphany or some other height that can be reached in life - there is no philosophical hope for arguing in an honest way. Religious views also obviously poison the intellectual endeavor here, as they do with anything.\n\nIf, however, you accept that reality is profoundly negative for sentience in general, and you don't accept the idea that untold suffering could justify some vague past, present, or future positive experience, then you can begin trying to look for holes in Antinatalism. \n\nI'm open to the idea that Antinatalism is wrong, in the same way I'm open to every single thing I believe\/perceive being wrong. It would have to be a condition where the suffering on earth is \"worth it\". The demand for that amount of horror however, would have to be immense. I'm not open to any kind of pleasurable experience justifying this suffering. The only *possible* justification for what went on, is going on, and will continue to go on for sentient beings on Earth, would have to be an alternative of a truly unimaginable hell that would make Earth's history seem like paradise by comparison. And the choice would have to offer no other alternative, in the sense that we either pick to continue the suffering on earth, and hope it gets reduced, as we make constant technological, philosophical, and scientific progress, **or** we doom far greater suffering on a far greater number of far more sentient beings. Scenarios like that is where someone could probably make arguments against Efilism and Antinatalism.\n\nAside from that very fringe case, I don't see how one could argue against AN.

This is the nature of the brain, and it is analogous to the way in which you eat the whole bag of chips vs only some of it, and you are fully aware of this. Fully present. Full of guilt. You say something like... \"I know I should stop. I just *know* it...\" Yet you continue to reach into the bag for another chip, and end up eating the whole bag. And then you start *another* bag. Insanity sets in. \"Why?\" \"Why can't I stop?\"\n\nThis is the description of the sensation of life, once you recognize it is not worth living. Forces like the instinct to survive, guilt, wishful thinking, uncertainty, the risks associated with suicide, the fear of the unknown of death, and various other biases, pressures and cognitive obstacles all conspire to ensure you continue to dance like a marionette. Self deliverance is possible for some, but even this can serve to invalidate the claim Camus is making. If it's implied that life is worth living for those who have spent another day alive, then life must not be worth living for those who have chosen to die. Right?\n\nNo... this idea is nonsense. Because it's perfectly possible for someone to be deeply confused about the quality of their own life, or life in general, and be driven by this (determined) belief to end their lives.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1556859544,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"emdul7y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bjz02o","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_bjz02o","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/bjz02o\/the_point_of_philosophy\/emdul7y\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1561451713,"score":13,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I've been on a huge Zizek binge lately, watching both Pervert's guide documentaries and just about all recorded content.\n\nStill though, I don't think Imperial China's rise to power can be attributed to the fact that they(very selfishly, I might add) gave each other gifts to one up each other. It's obvious what's going on there. I come from a culture myself where this sort of pathological gift giving occurs. Everyone just wants to look good.\n\nIs this as good as altruism gets? No, but true altruism is incompatible with a truly 'winning strategy'. \n\nIs this at odds somehow, with the psychopathic model I presented? Not only is it not at odds with the dominant model for 'winning', it is crucial to it. Psychopathic culture feeds of these sorts of superficial displays of benevolence. It's superficial because it's completely empty of genuine generosity. Empathy is not operational here, total self-absorption and a pathological concern for maintaining face are.\n\nA truly altruist culture, again, simply gets eaten alive by the kind of brutish culture natural selection has awarded us with. Just examine some of what a perfected psychopathy entails: \n\n1) Domineering\/Controlling \n\n2) Callous\/Lacking empathy and remorse \n\n3) Grandiose\/Narcissistic\/Egomaniacal \n\n4) A superficial, charming, benevolent exterior\n\nIf one had to write an honest resume in order to become an elite of the Earth, this would be what you'd find. And natural selection is what produces this sort of individual. Why is that? It's because if we rewind the tape of evolutionary history enough, the sort of person alive today who best fits these traits, had they met a kind, altruistic, selfless and meek ape, this ape would have 1) Had their skull bashed in with a rock when they least expected it 2) Had their partner raped and made to bear his children 3) Had their brains scooped out and consumed for added calories.\n\nThat is what winning looks like, as far as natural selection is concerned. This hasn't changed much in 2019. The fact that apes sometimes cooperate isn't a problem here. The psychopath will always dominate these apes one way or another, because he functions on a system that says \"I not only don't *need* to play by the rules, I can pretend to play by them, and I can rewrite them to my desires, and break them to my desires.

I'm just not sure how to trigger the intuitions I have here in others. The issues with the bees and ants, is that it's just not an equivalent analogy. You'd need it to be something like fire ants vs. carpenter ants(The results are as you'd expect). It doesn't matter how altruistic a carpenter ant society is, the animal running the brutal psychopathic system **always** wins in nature. With bees, it would be something like honey bees vs. killer bees(again, we don't need to delude ourselves about who would win if a conflict occurred).\n\nWith humans, you need to imagine instead something more microcosmic and distilled. Let's just narrow it down as much as we can. Scrap all this complex technology and economics and cultural quirks. Just imagine two tribes in 10,000 B.C. competing for resources. Equivalent in offense, defense, technology, population, and resource control. One tribe, are a tribe based on a hierarchy that promotes psychopathy(all of this is in a naturalistic context, there's no \"Declaration of Psychopathy\", obviously). Which is to say, manipulation, domination, egoism, superficiality, and a lack of empathy thrive here. Again, every time I describe psychopathy I get the sense that anyone reading is utterly confused about what this looks like. Exactly **none** of these traits are **visible** within the tribe. The tribe is a perfectly happy, cheerful, love and fairness promoting place, internally. There is an almost Disney-like character to being a member of this tribe. This is an illusion. This is what psychopathy does. Psychopathy is a kind of human cloaking device. This is the means by which someone like Ted Bundy can get away with repeatedly enticing, raping, and murdering young women. The essence of psychopathy is **undetectable** camouflage, and anything that **is** detectable is just **failed** psychopathy, in precisely the same way that a stick insect which is detected by a predator is a **failed** camouflage. Keep this in mind.\n\nThe other tribe, turns the dials **down** on the psychopathy described above, but instead allows for a less domineering culture. Less emphasis is placed on manipulating the hierarchy and ascending it. Less emphasis is placed on covert egotism. More emphasis is placed on altruism. More emphasis is placed on the kind of mutual aid you describe. I'm not suggesting here that altruism and mutual aid are in principle incompatible with psychopathy. For the \"Disney-like\" character I described earlier, we probably **need** some degree of both real and illusory altruism and mutual aid to function at all. But between these two tribes, the tribe which ~~maximizes~~ **perfects** it's psychopathy, is the tribe that wins. There is only so much strategy bandwidth from the point of view of natural selection. You cannot both be truly and unambiguously(from the point of natural selection only) psychopathic, and truly and unambiguously altruistic and aid providing. There is some tension between domination and aid providing, not total tension, since in certain contexts altruism and aid can be forms of domination and pacification and serve utility purposes, or be compatible with pro-social psychopathy. The point I'm trying to nail down is that nothing strategically can win against a perfected psychopathy. No alternative exists, because psychopathy creates a certain fire in living things which makes a sport and art out of becoming king of all reality. Whatever supersedes this strategy is by definition a superior form of psychopathy.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1556957914,"distinguished":null,"edited":1556958197,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"emh0bk0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bk15w4","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_emgzmw1","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/bk15w4\/i_got_this_on_my_recommendations_the_doomer_meme\/emh0bk0\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1561505592,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

What people *really* mean in almost all cases when they say they want to hear the truth, is:\n\n\"I want to have my beliefs about myself and my representation of the world confirmed.\"\n\nWe didn't evolve to take kindly to the truth, as the truth almost always threatens to shatter some deeply held conviction of ours. Consider how eagerly people tend to accept lies if they confirm a deeply held conviction, as a point of comparison. You see this all the time with things like religion, political ideology, self-image, and the representations of others in our minds.\n\nIn regards to your main question, I'm not sure about Jordan Peterson, but in general I think at least one of two types of unconscious knowledge can be awakened. The type I'm fairly certain can, is the type that's cobbled together by the adaptive unconscious. Imagine a setting like North Korea, where one is doomed by their specific stretch of spacetime to be deeply confused about reality. Indoctrination, brainwashing, gaslighting awaits for people in this situation. Yet I'm fairly certain that on some level, everyone knows *something* isn't right. Something has felt off since childhood. I think *this* type of buried awareness can clearly be awakened. But I'm not sure about the other kind, the trans-generational kind. That would be the Jungian kind, which I'm not a huge fan of. Not a staunch opponent or anything, but not a fan. The core problem is these archetypes are non-falsifiable, and I think there are better explanations for human(and animal) instincts and drives in modern psychology and biology.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1557001955,"distinguished":null,"edited":1557002232,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"emihi05","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bixgui","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_emi7xlq","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/bixgui\/on_free_will_an_argument_for_determinism_and_its\/emihi05\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1561530581,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

So, once you acquire control over your own life, and control how and when it can end, that can be liberating in itself and reduce suicidal thought, paradoxically.

I remember back in the 90's, and the old Prozac commercials that had that little sad cartoon blob, with the dystopian voice saying \"Depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain\" and it just seemed like more superficial garbage, like everything else on TV.\n\nI thought about it a bit once I learned the history of psychiatry and thought: \"Wait... we were literally excising frontal lobes a few decades ago... something's not right here. There's no way in hell the 21st century has this stuff figured out. The world is *really* bad for most people, there's something perverse about giving someone a pill that attempts to prevent them from being sad in a deeply sinister world.\"\n\nThe level of dishonesty with psychiatry's approach to these drugs, would be analogous to a medical field whose response to someone getting chronic stab wounds, is to apply a chemical coating to the skin to make it more leathery and resistant to knife attacks, and then the patient leaves, only to continue getting stabbed, while being reminded \"Don't forget to apply your medicine! Maybe if your skin becomes tougher, the knife attacks will decrease.\"\n\nIt's pretty insane.\n\n&gt;pliable tax paying slave\n\nYes, I share your intuitions here as well. I believe the taboo of suicide exists purely for this reason. There is no other rational explanation for why the taboo of death exists, other than to serve larger interests. Suicide is bad for business, as long as you live, you have immense value to the human farmers. Just like if the farmed cows would gain self-awareness and say \"Wait a second... how about.... we stop this slavery? I'm just going to bash my skull against the metal fence here until I die\"(Which is, actually what they've been known to do if I'm not mistaken. A trend with higher animals in captivity)\n\nAntipsychiatry rant aside, I don't think anyone who understands just how bad life gets can meaningfully discourage suicide.

I certainly don't blame you for being optimistic, this is a winning strategy for continuing the game. The first problem however, is recognizing the fact that seeing a truly negative reality for what it is, is maladaptive. From an evolutionary, big picture view, humans who identified the bad in life simply had lower survival and reproductive chance. We are bred to be blindly optimistic, which causes us to fail to properly form representations of the world.\n\nWishful thinking is another big bias doing heavy lifting for most people.

There used to be no life, but there is life now. It is not the case that the inception of life created \u201cnew\u201d matter. It\u2019s the same old stuff (atoms) in a distinctive orientation that is self-perpetuating (life). Therefore, it\u2019s not too far a stretch to consider that we as individuals are the same thing as our environment.\n\nWell, it's not the physical matter that's conscious or living, it's simply the way the matter organizes itself. An electron inside my heart isn't any more alive or conscious than an electron inside a rock. Consciousness(but not freedom) emerges from the organization of particles.\n\n&gt; If you consider what\u2019s occurring inside you to be the same process that\u2019s occurring outside you, then you can effectively broaden your notion of a \u201cself\u201d to be both the individual and the environment. \n\nThis is all well and good, and it's true that \"you are a part of the universe\", but none of this gives us even the slightest drop of freedom.\n\n&gt;Previously, free will was defined as the freedom of the individual necessarily in relation to the environment. But if the individual and environment are redefined to be the same, some freedom exists.\n\nWell, no. Freedom is simply the ability to choose which thoughts you think and which actions you take. The idea is nonsensical. You don't choose thoughts, thoughts simply arise from causes. These causes can be internal **or** external. It doesn't matter if we took you into some \"non-environment\" state, where it was just your brain and a vacuum of black void. You would have absolutely no freedom in such an environment. When we introduce environment, you **still** have no freedom.\n\nThe entire notion of freedom of will **cannot** really be argued from the perspectives of physics, philosophy, or even neuroscience. This argument is done to death, and fully demonstrated. The correct way to tackle free will is through **psychology**. **Why** do some people **need** to lie about freedom? The answer is in the human ego. No freedom is the ultimate threat to an egotistical person. It is an intruder, which threatens to steal pride. It threatens to make a mockery out of the idea of revenge. Of retribution. Of punishment as we know it today. These are things the ape brain simply struggles to let go of. So we continue to lie and cling to philosophically and scientifically nonsensical ideas. Psychology **determines** your beliefs in free will. If you are an egoist, with a sense of self which you are too invested in to let go of, you will reject losing your illusory freedom with tooth and nail. This is the final solution to the free will problem. Some people have too much to lose to accept it, but the tragic aspect of this is, there is nothing to be afraid of. Determinism is far more humane than the illusion of free will. Most of the inequality and suffering and oppression in the world is fueled by the idea of free will.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1557220724,"distinguished":null,"edited":1557220946,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"emq2h44","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bixgui","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_empw13r","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/bixgui\/on_free_will_an_argument_for_determinism_and_its\/emq2h44\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1561674111,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Their parents, peers, romantically, etc. This is the first thing you should probably understand and be wary of with BPD. You will feel like a doormat sometimes, because you have this naiive approach to a society which structures their interactions on the concept of social dominance.\n\nPerhaps you never got bullied directly, but this constant looming sense and fear of rejection is felt. You just want normal things. To be loved, to be accepted, to be validated, but the problem is, human beings are not engines of love or acceptance of validation. But the problem is, no one wants to be around people who are needy(Which borderlines tend to be). No one wants to be around people who easily get hurt. No one wants to be around people whose life is hell. People are creeped out by a \"pouring of the heart and soul\" as you say, more than they are honored by it. This is just caused by a misunderstanding that socialization is a game. There is a complex social dynamic, and the core theme from my experience, has been domination. No matter your gender, you are vying for dominance, because that's what apes who evolved for millions of years do. \n\nDominance is what the DNA wants. Dominance gives you the best chance to spread genes, again, what the DNA wants. So we have these various behaviors, manipulation, altruism, rejection, \"A pouring of the heart and soul\", aggressive behavior, controlling behavior, bullying, a need to please others, a need to be pleased, a need for fairness, a need to get the better deal in a relationship, etc\n\nThese are all just \"Strategies\" to socialize, done unconsciously. Our brain then maps over all of this, a fictional story. The reality is the social hierarchy, who dominates who. Once you're aware of how your brain is working, and how the brains of others work, you are free to ask yourself things like \"How much sense does this make?\" \"Should I continue this relationship?\" \"Who gets more value from this relationship?\" \"Is this dynamic toxic?\" \"Are the motives this person has for wanting to see me sincere? Are mine?\" etc. The awareness of the game changes the game, and the only way to do that is to be a lifelong student of psychology and a lifelong analyst of your own mind, and the \"machinery\" under the \"story\" your brain creates.

I'm sure there are some, but I guess I'm too pessimistic to use the word 'many'. On the topic of hate and pity, pity is by definition to imply someone is inferior to you in a specific way, so I disagree there. As for hate, I'm not sure I'd say it's \"Okay to hate someone\". It's *understandable* to hate someone, and hate can certainly be a useful emotion. For instance, if someone kidnaps you, and brutally tortures you for their own pointless needs, hate can drive you to murder your torturer. But when we get down to the nitty gritty of reality, all hate is irrational. To feel extreme dislike for something is, first, silly, since your don't choose what you hate. And what you hate, does not choose to be what you hate. Blaming your torturer for torturing you is pointless. It's natural to do it, and understandable? Yes. Is it rational? Ultimately, no.\n\nIn the torture example, you have no choice but to hate the torturer, if you do end up hating them. The hate is hoisted upon you, to be dealt with or not, by other processes in your mind. Likewise, the torturer did not choose to be born a child which would be one day shaped to be a torturer, and do hate-inducing things.

The bad news about child abuse, is it's a defensible parenting strategy from the point of natural selection, which does not care about ethics. My personal view is that parenting brutality is a high risk survival strategy whose risk scales inversely with the brutality of the world. What does this mean? Imagine two worlds whose nature cannot be clearly seen by those inside it - most citizens of these worlds are blind to the world's nature except for some fringe people. We'll call them kindness world, and brutal world.\n\nIf there are some parents in kindness world, which is a relatively peaceful place full of kindness and joy, but some fringe parents treat their children like psychopathic tyrants, this strategy would be generally bad from the point of view of natural selection. These children would not survive on average. The children would not be accepted into kindness world, and would be outcasts. Or they would be accepted, but too damaged to function due to the brutality of their childhood. They would go into the world, and be so damaged, that they would not be able to cope with how unfortunate they were. Sometimes, such a strategy would result in psychopathic children. Children who are taught brutality in a non-brutal world, but who can hide their brutality and fit into this world of kindness. These children spread their genes, and dominate the world with brutality over the course of generations. High risk, high reward.\n\nIn brutal world however, the brutal parenting model is essential for survival. Every kid is viciously beaten, bullied by a social hierarchy, tortured for pleasure by their parents while being gaslit and professed \"Tough love\". If parents from the kindness world could get transported into the brutal world, and try to raise children using the kindness model, their children will get eaten alive and torn to shreds by the brutal world and it's inhabitants. The two strategies are not equal. One is literally more advantageous than the other. And when you have an advantageous strategy, natural selection **pushes** this strategy forward until a better one comes along. And if no better strategy than brutality comes along, then brutality, and especially **covert** brutality, which is what we simply know as \"psychopathy\", will come to dominate everything.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1557320297,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":1},"id":"emtq603","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bm34pv","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_emtopch","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/bm34pv\/wow_i_need_some_help_and_advice\/emtq603\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1561737965,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":1}

Imagine a \"perfect opiate\", which does not cause tolerance, but very gradually increase pleasure and satisfaction the more one takes it. If we put a child on an IV drip of this drug, they may report at the end of life, that their life was a joy to experience. Of course, in reality, this person was doomed by drugs in a way, to not see all the lows of their life. Like their friends becoming frustrated with the fact that this person was simply high all the time, and abandoning him. He would find new friends and everything was peachy again. Or he didn't, and things would of course still be just as good. He would enjoy things people wouldn't enjoy had they **not** been on such a drug regimen. Had this child enjoyed a positive relationship with their parents, they wouldn't even shed a tear at the funeral, they'd just be on cloud 9 at all times, no matter how good or bad life became. If this person had a person on the planet they cared the most about, and said person died in a tragic, and horrific way, again - nothing but bliss. Simply high all the time.\n\nDoes it matter if this person says, at the end of life, \"My life was a great experience. Just great. I wouldn't change it for the world. I didn't suffer for even a second.\"?\n\nIt should be obvious that the objective quality of one's life matters as well. If we could give this person another drug, let's call this the \"Wake up and see objective reality\" drug, and they took it, they would be mortified. They would break down and cry over how much they lost, while high. Friendships broken, children killed because this person was busy being high, problems ignored, etc. Only a sociopath would say in this scenario \"Ehhh... no big deal. Didn't miss much. Would rather just be high.\"\n\nSo... even if we could trick the brains of someone via some quirk of psychology and the neuroscience of how experiences are perceived based on the order in which they occur, would this really matter? Would it matter that the child at the end of it says, \"Life had a lot of bad, but there was so much satisfaction at the end that I'm going to **proclaim** my life was worth living.\"?\n\nThe life has to be **genuinely** worth living. If we can know this to be the case, and we know there is no further procreation, and no harm caused, then giving birth to such a child wouldn't be a problem. But for such a birth to be ethically justifiable, you need to control the variables very closely.\n\nThe world would **need** to be a genuinely good place for conscious creatures. No crazy aliens around the corner who can turn your planet into a torture simulation. No conspiracy among well hidden psychopaths on your planet. 0% chance for anything to go wrong. No social problems on your planet. 0% probability of harm as a result of the existence of the person, and 0% probability of harm to the person for existing. 100% guaranteed exit of reality and a ceasing of consciousness if the person no longer wishes to exist, with zero negative baggage. Essentially, every unknown would need to be known. You would need to not only be god for this to be a move which isn't unethical, you would need to be a benevolent god. Even when you control those variables, you still have the problem of consent.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1557325744,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"emtyuet","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_blh8rn","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_emtvohw","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/blh8rn\/does_temporal_ordering_of_suffering_and_happiness\/emtyuet\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1561742046,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

If you don't abuse your children, they get eaten alive in a world of psychopaths. Abusing one's children is a kind of psychopathy training, which serves to reduce empathy, increase resilience in a world of psychopaths, and teach tyranny and domination by example.(This is why you so often find that those who were abused, abused others).\n\nThe core method to ascend socially is covert(and often overt) domination, which co-incides with the same method to ascend economically and reproductively. \n\nEmpathy is a maladaptive trait more than ever -- and it never was a particularly great adaptation to begin with.

You don't exist, and never did.\n\nWhich do you choose? It's obvious that the second one comes with zero risk.

My gut tells me that hero myths and stories are some form of cultural propaganda which we would be better off without, but I'm not sure. \n\n\nWhat is pretty clear to me however is that in reality, the \"heroes\" are simply covert psychopaths who get to rewrite history and have statues of themselves erected and praised by future generations. If the genocidal dictators of the 20th century happened to win the relevant wars, they would be celebrated as revolutionary heroes in their respective countries, there would be statues elected of them, and children would learn about their greatness in school. But... Oops! They happened to lose. So they're the bad guys, and whoever beat them, are of course, the good guys. Tough luck. Most children can untangle the logic of this problem themselves. No one is the good guy. It's just stronger bad guys, vs. less strong bad guys. Winners get to be the hero. This is true both on the macro scale(Nations, global alliances, smaller states), and the micro scale(small groups, families, 1 on 1 relations). \n\n So what utility do our cross cultural mythos have? To encourage psychopaths to be more benevolent within their in-group in hopes of praise and admiration from the masses who need saving? To trick children into aspiring towards something they can never be? That part is unclear to me. My instincts tell me the purpose is related to psychopath self-image grooming. If a monster believes they're a superman-like figure, they are at an advantage in domination on a macro level, because their allies are not seen as minions(even though they are essentially helpless animals whose purpose appears to be to act as casualties, victims in need of saving, and admiration generators).

The only sober analysis of the human condition includes the bad things in life, and which incentives create those bad things. Anything from childhood bullying to dropping nuclear weapons on nations, is the result of the same process. The process says, if you dominate, your survival improves. You can cite thousands of metrics for how life has improved, but has domination improved? Of course not. It has only stronger, more covert, and adapted to either be obscured or palatable.\n\nThe same engines which create [baboons eating smaller animals as if they're a piece of fruit](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=21) and [step fathers treating their stepchildren as sex toys to dominate](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u0cGxikOHPM&amp;t=985s), are the engines which create the byproducts we call \"Progress\" and \"Non-Zero sum elements\". To speak of progress and ignore the bullseye of life and it's implications, is really to just have the train whizz by you and say \"Wow, that was a really strong breeze. I find such strong wind elements to be pleasant and exciting!\" All one needs to do to grasp reality for what it is, beyond shedding optimism bias and wishful thinking(biases which many will take with them to the grave, alas), is to picture the baboon in the video returning to his family, hugging his children, kissing his wife on the cheek, churning out another child, and proclaiming: \"Tomorrow will be a better day.\" Better, in this context, means he will trade the brutality of eating the gazelle alive, for instead enslaving the entire wild gazelle population, butchering their children, and enjoying the newly crafted throne the profits produce. This is the full scope of progress, and why simply looking at progress alone is some combination of delusional, naive, ignorant, and obscurantist.\n\nIn conclusion, the world is very plainly run by psychopaths because natural selection only allows for such an outcome, progress and non-zero sum elements are a byproduct or kind of run-off, not a \"goal\".

You appear to still be missing the point I'm making in regards to progress. Progress doesn't occur because humanity is continually striving towards virtue, this is a Disneyfied fantasy. The countries which have the governments you describe, do so because they **must** , in order to cling to power, while the countries which don't, don't because they have such immense geopolitical influence in other ways, that they can parade themselves as pseudo-democracies. Human rights is another type of \"run-off\", and any investigation into human rights violations will find them to be rampant towards anyone who defies the most powerful players on Earth. If the United States or the European Union or some other superpower was at a crossroads that involved violating your human rights in the most sadistic way imaginable, or perish, what do you think the ruling bodies would choose? To not have to violate human rights is a **luxury** of the Ultra-powerful, and this luxury is manifested as a result of being a **sub-optimal strategy**, not because it is wrong. And of course, when it's deemed necessary, you see it with as much regularity as the flow of the tides. \n\n From a totally naive outsiders perspective, we appear to be pathologically optimistic and pessimistic, so I'm not sure how fruitful continuing the discussion will be. The reality I'm looking at is quite literally a dystopian hellscape where nihilism envelops a flickering flame of civility a billion to 1, covered by a facade of civility and progress, which act as pacifiers, placebos, scraps, and vestiges of natural selection... and the reality you're looking at is some sort of ultimately benevolent and majestic, albeit, occasionally hamfisted and cruel, global betterment project. We aren't going to see eye to eye anytime soon, we have too much invested in our respective worldviews to budge.\n\nI'll leave you with a coarse analogy. Imagine a 10 player chess-like game, where the board state is wildly unfair because some players had advantages early on, one of which was cheating in the worst ways possible. One player, perhaps the lead player, tells another competing player. \"If you make that move, I'll have your daughter killed execution style. Here is the footage of her in captivity.\" Earlier in the game, a player's genitals were electrocuted for not bowing to the thug in control of the state of the board. Another player, willfully loses, just to harm the leading player's chances - all for naught, the lead here is too large. Upon stepping away from the game, this player's foolishness is punished by being tortured for the remainder of his life in a military dungeon. When the cameras turn to showcase the event, all the spectator sees is superficial smiles. From the spectator's view, everyone's playing a friendly game. Some cheating occurs, and some of it is corrected perhaps, but eventually bygones are bygones, and everyone seems to be playing more and more fairly as the game progresses! Splendid! To fully flesh out the analogy, the audience watching is drugged and brainwashed from birth to watch and fund the game until the die, in exchange for a rewards program.\n\nThat perspectival difference between viewing the game as a naive spectator and one who sees the sick farce the \"game\" is, is the difference between an optimistic view of the human condition and a pessimistic one. When in doubt, simply watch more baboons eating baby gazelles alive and ponder about the relationship between this behavior and becoming one of the most influential human beings on the planet earth, historically, actually, and potentially. Think of the kind of person you need to be to beat another country in war. Or economically. Which sorts of attributes help in \"Winning\"? Which attributes are selected for with the highest success? What are the trends you notice between psychopathy(Not the Holywood caricature or beta psychopaths like Ted Bundy, I'm talking about Apex psychopathy which is a literal social cloaking device mapped over perfected Machiavellianism that would make Machiavelli himself seem like the Dalai Lama). and survival. \n\nBest of luck.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1557593350,"distinguished":null,"edited":1557594207,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"en4qkwq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bn8w05","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_en4oid5","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bn8w05\/is_it_possible_to_experience_pleasure_or\/en4qkwq\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1561924513,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

The \"gene pool\" that biology concerns itself with isn't the same \"gene pool\" I consider meaningful. A truly big picture view of biology could in a certain context say that certain traits of cows are beneficial to survival because they made the cow interesting enough for us to domesticate - but of course, if all factory farm cows could suddenly gain omniscience and higher forms of sentience, it would be very clear that the only proper strategic move is voluntary bovine genocide. The gene pool of the factory cow has been co-opted by humans who enslaved the species. In precisely the same way, altruistic traits simply lose to psychopathic traits, because they are co-opted for the benefit of elite human beings, who can only be described as psychopaths because there's simply no phenotypic space for another strategy to compete with psychopathy at the apex of human hierarchy. We don't call pro-social psychopathy an \"altruistic trait\" here because apart from the incidental altruism, psychopathy is playing an entirely different and incompatible long term genetic strategy. \n\nAnother potential snag here, is defining what I mean about psychopathy.

War will exist of course, but war will get colder, and colder, and colder, until it's so obscured only a hyper elite are even aware of war. The true horror of the future will involve people who will be unable to ever realize just how horrific their reality is. Slaves who love their chains, that sort of thing. This exists at present to some degree, and will continue to metastasize into a bona fide dystopia where everyone thinks life is great, while actually being forced into a kind of slavery which they will be completely unable to see for that it is.\n\nEdit: Another good hypothesis I'd feel comfortable betting on is the transhuman elitism that \/u\/StoopyGoblin mentions. This also seems very plausible. Once an elite are more powerful and exert more force than 99.9% of the planet, these people will be removed if they are big enough liabilities. I'm not sure how we'd be big enough liabilities. Of course, we're already enslaved to the .1% of the planet, and have been for thousands of years. I don't think we're terribly close to getting removed but just one technological breakthrough can change that.\n\nOn the topic of \"liability\", it's more likely that people will just get ignored rather than some sort of mass genocide. The analogy here would be like Usain Bolt running a 200 meter race against a toddler. The toddler cannot even touch him, much like chimpanzees cannot touch us.

The optimist is the person who copes in a way which doesn't confront the harshness of reality. The harshness of reality is less compatible on a psychological level with optimism than it is with pessimism.\n\nI think you're spot on when you say optimists rationalize tragedy, but it occurs because of personality traits despite sometimes manifesting itself through religious language. The roots of optimism, if optimism is pathological at all, are probably cognitive biases(some of which are adaptations from the point of view of natural selection).\n\n&gt;But most pessimists accept that most suffering is inherently meaningless which can make tragedies easier to accept. \n\nI think this confuses pessimism with nihilism, they're two distinct approaches to reality. Sometimes they overlap, sometimes not. There are many non-nihilist pessimists, I suspect most prominent pessimist philosophers aren't nihilists but I'm not very sure there.\n\n&gt;I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say that optimism or pessimism are inherently better or superior than one another in terms of how much peace of mind they can generate for an individual or how content they can make a person feel- both in the short and long term.\n\nThat's true, everyone's different.

It's really unclear to me. One possibility is that the snowball is so big already, that it cannot be stopped no matter what. This would be quite tragic, and would probably mean everyone should just abandon ship as quickly as possible.\n\nI think the odds are very poor, but that's just my own pessimistic guess. Human beings are just like any another creature. The strongest creature, or set of creatures, get to dominate the other creatures, and no one can stop them. This is just **how** nature is. And we are no exception.\n\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/1x9zbO1-0Uc?t=211\n\nMuch like none of the lions here can challenge this Lioness who exerts her will to her own amusement and impulses to kill the baby cub, humanity is helpless to challenge whatever is at the top of human hierarchy, who does whatever they need to do to achieve domination and power in a systematic, strategic, and gradual way across very long spans of time that cannot be tracked by the average person. And power is quite skewed due to the way technological advances are acquired(The rich and powerful first, always). Now, many here familiar with biology may say, \"That's not true! In nature, occasionally a tyrant Alpha is ganged up on and killed by the entire group! There is hope for humanity!\" \n\nBut the problem is, in humanity, the difference between the apex, and lower rungs of the hierarchy, is like the difference between the owner of a large factory farm and a factory farmed cow. Cows, are doomed on planet earth. If you're a cow born in a factory farm, you are **doomed** to hell. There is no revolt. There is no rebellion. There is no whistleblowing. There is no takeover. Nothing. You are simply a milkslave. Your children **will** be taken from you, killed, and you will be forced to bear new children, and engineered and manipulated to maximize your milk output until you die.\n\nThis is what the average human life is, too, it appears. We are metaphorical \"milk slaves\" to the tops of human hierarchy at present. What can save us? Probably some sort of coup at the very top of the apex, but... it would have to be very specifically heroic in the mythological and comic book sense. So far, nothing about reality is like a movie or fairy tale. There is no reason to believe in a happy ending.

Sky dad is **always** watching you, like a dystopian dictator. Better not mess up! He can send you to eternal torture if you mess up!\n\nOf course, all of this is complete nonsense, and is quite literally **child abuse**. It can sometimes take many, many years to undo the damage of religious indoctrination. What helped me personally was just taking an interest in philosophy and science. Learn what makes logic and reason, logical and reasonable. Learn some psychology, which allows you to understand yourself and others better. Just take up cognitive biases as a hobby and that alone will do wonders.\n\nFun fact: Did you know that our brains *literally* evolved to **lie** to ourselves?

You'd need more evidence than just this.\n\nWe do know that secretive and powerful organizations have had experiments on mind control in the past(MK-Ultra being the most well known and easily available), and it's clear that controlling a nation's mind is a powerful incentive for a competing superpower. One strange thing I'll point out here though without jumping to any kind of conclusion, is I've constantly noticed a constant high pitch tone in the ears, of varying pitch and intensity, in the past few years. \n\nBut yeah, I think the unfortunate part of highly conspiratorial ideas like mass mind control and even the purpose of this reddit, to discuss the idea if we're living in a simulation, probably cannot be solved. The power disparity between the two groups in such a dynamic is simply too immense. A helpful analogy to understand this is the case of factory farmed cows. Everyone, even meat eaters must know that the life is a cow in a factory farm is essentially a kind of hellish enslavement. You are genetically and biochemically engineered to produce as much milk as possible, enduring extreme pain in a small cell. You are forcefully inseminated, made to carry your child, give birth to it, after which it is almost immediately taken from you, causing immense depression for both mother and calf, and then slaughtered for veal. You on the other hand, are immediately injected with more semen, all the while, being constantly milked until your udders are sore and\/or bleeding. For life. Until you die. That's when mercy arrives.\n\nOf course, an outside view of this scenario is hell. But from the perspective of the cow, how aware can the cow be of their hell? I think that's an interesting question, and I suspect we'd be mortified if we could answer it. But the sad part is, these creatures cannot suddenly unionize and create some kind of cow ethics alliance. They can't whisper to each other, \"Hey, fuck this torture chamber... Let's all bash our heads against the pen until we die(Singular cows do this, by the way, but no organized effort). And certainly, the cows cannot train in combat, weaponize, and then stage a coup where they murder all factory farming humans, and attempt to create a cow utopia or cow nation where they enjoy basic rights of living things.\n\nHumans are very much in the same category with questions like top-down mind control or living in simulations. The \"eye above you\", whether it's farmers, an ultra powerful secret agency, or some elite being simulating the universe for whatever reason, has such a massive advantage that escape truly feels hopeless and almost has to by definition come from sheer luck or happenstance.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1557851619,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"enhhbl1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bo87um","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_bo87um","permalink":"\/r\/AWLIAS\/comments\/bo87um\/leaked_government_documents_on_wirelessremote\/enhhbl1\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1562141195,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AWLIAS","subreddit_id":"t5_2vmwn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AWLIAS","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Your merely a compelled puppet of forces outside yourself? \n\nI don't have free agency, but I'm obviously an agent. I have impulses, and I act on them. I can deliberate on these impulses all I want, but ultimately, these decisions are a result of variables outside of 1) My understanding 2) My control. Therefore, they cannot be free.\n\n&gt;And if that's true for you than how can you possibly hold anyone else accountable for anything?\n\nYou cannot hold people accountable for anything, and you cannot feel you truly deserve some accomplishment of yours, this is a correct implication of no free will. What does this actually mean, however? That we shouldn't lock up dangerous psychopaths and let them roam free? Of course not. Just because someone like Ted Bundy isn't to blame for all the women he raped and murdered(Or murdered then raped, alas), since certain circumstances outside of Ted's control **created** the brain of a serial killing rapist necrophile with zero empathy, doesn't mean we are compelled to allow someone like him to roam free. He's clearly dangerous to anyone and has to be isolated. We shouldn't put him in prison as some kind of *punishment*, again, that's just barbaric stupidity that results from a belief in free will. Punishment can only make sense if you think people are truly to blame for who they become. If punishment made sense, then if we had a drug to give Bundy which undid the damage to his brain by his unfortunate, deeply psychologically and physically abusive childhood, it would make sense to punish him by **not** giving him the drug so he could suffer in prison for all the harm he's done. Again, more barbarism is exposed from the religious belief that people have free will. Of course, any sane approach here would to be help Ted, and give him the drug. \n\nPride also goes out the window. This one is very easy to tackle. If you're born to an ultra billionaire and have 20 million dollars sitting in a trust fund, waiting for you as a present on your 18th birthday, and you eventually become the richest man in the world upon turning 40, it doesn't take a genius to understand the circumstances of this person's life kind of had a role to play in his success. Likewise, if you are born into the worst slum of India, to a drug addicted mother, and a physically and psychologically abusive father, and you don't escape your circumstances, it doesn't take much to understand the circumstances had quite a bit to do with it. All of life is like this, just gradations of circumstance. Everything in life is decided **for** you ultimately, by physics. This includes how hard you work to improve. This includes if you can get over your substance abuse addiction. This includes your grades. All outside of your control, and therefore, all make a mockery of the idea of being \"proud\". This is where people fall into the intellectual mud with the illusion of free will. The human ego struggles with the idea of discarding their pride. So they cling deeply to free will. It is their safety blanket that tells them, \"Shhhh don't worry, You can feel proud. You're **special**.\"\n\n&gt; Or do we just accept existence is all merely an excercise in pointless utilitarianism and we are just playing our rolls.\n\nI don't see what utilitarianism has to do with anything here. We are helplessly playing our roles, however, yes.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1557854881,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"enho7b2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bmyqht","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ene4f6b","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bmyqht\/natalists_who_mock_the_less_fortunate_are_simply\/enho7b2\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1562144433,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I think the culprit **is** humanity itself. Our state today exists as a result of a morally indifferent process, which incentivizes not ethics, but **whatever** can get one ahead, and then promotes this thing via natural selection, and suppresses every loser via death without reproduction. The immediate objection here is ideas like altruism and all the apparent good that humanity does. But this just isn't very compelling to me. I think deep down inside, we're all just opportunistic psychopaths. And that would explain a lot, because we certainly come from opportunistic psychopaths:\n\nThe same exact natural process that gives rise to this:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PcnH_TOqi3I\n\nGives rise to this:\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u0cGxikOHPM&amp;t=985s\n\nAt first this may seem reductionist. Couldn't you say that physics also gives rise to both of these things? You could think these are completely distinct behaviors, but what these clips have in common is they both show mere apes, acting as apes tend to do - like psychopaths. You could also say, \"I'm not like any of that!\" but deep down inside, you are. There are conditions in life that would trigger some sort of depravity in you, almost certainly. And the baboon in this video is more or less like your ancestors. Your ancestors are the apes who encountered another group who were asleep, bashed rocks over the skulls of the males, raped the women, and probably ate the men. Empathy today, is just as poor of an adaptation as it ever was. The benefits of empathy and any pro-social trait is far outweighed by the benefits that psychopaths gain from gaining access to pro-social signals under the camouflage of their psychopathy. \n\nAnd the genes associated with psychopathy are the genes that win, evolutionarily. There is no genetic archetype in apes like ourselves that defeats a truly perfected, Alpha Psychopathy(What you would discover at the very apex of all human hierarchy). The spirit of those genes are the genes that are \"winning\" in the state of our world right now. But instead of manifesting themselves as rockbashing and rape, they manifest themselves in far more complicated ways, like invading countries with highly sophisticated information campaigns, technology, weapons, and organized efforts to achieve global dominance and lots of oil. So, even if we recoil at fossil fuels, meat eating, and whatever it is we're all ethically blind to today, it won't matter so long as we continue on with the firmware in our DNA.\n\nThe firmware says: Consume. Entertain yourself. Dominate to reproduce, and reproduce to dominate. But... do it with a smile! Do it in a way where everyone is some combination of confused, ignorant, coerced and therefore willing, or their resistance is irrelevant to your domination.\n\nEverything a human being can possibly do falls into serving at least one of these drives, and these drives feed into each other.

Just consider everything such a person has to lose. Pride goes out of the window. Whatever revenge narrative is in place, goes out the window. That's essentially a kind of psychological robbery to many people, and they will reject ideas which rob them of that thing they hold so dear - the ego.

I also think people who perhaps have been dealt a bad hand in life and realize the rampant inequality in the world should be more open to the deterministic nature of the world than say, someone fed with a silver spoon, or someone who falls on the lucky end of the human continuum. Someone who has experienced psychedelics(The fast lane to ego death) or mindfulness meditation(The very slow lane to ego death) will have no issues with the concept of no free will, as even the self is an illusion upon deep introspection of what's at the heart of human experience.\n\nThis of course, is a scientific hypothesis.

And now, seeing it once again, I'm fairly sure it's nonsense. Here's why:\n\nQuick tangent before I explain, actually. I have nothing against the people who hold Right-wing or Libertarian views much like with other political stances, I disagree some places, and agree in other places, but don't align myself to any political ideology. The one point of criticism I have here against these ideologies is they tend to make a fetish out of masculinity and individualism, and I think it shows with this strong men\/weak men meme. To be completely fair, the left makes a fetish out of misandry, so there's that. Anyway, political tangent aside, now to explain why I disagree with this meme:\n\nThere's never a moment where only weak men or strong men are operational. These supposed \"Strong men\", are fucking over large swaths of \"weak men\", via domination, at all points in history, because that's the nature of our social order. \"Strong men\" sitting at the top, \"Weak men\" sitting at the bottom. Domination is really the name of the game here, and that hasn't changed in hundreds of thousands(hundreds of millions if we go beyond apes) of years. The \"Strong men\" in this graphic, does **not** mean good men. It means the most psychopathic and dominant men on the planet. The strongest military. The most ruthless intelligence agency. The most merciless CEO's. Those are the \"Strong men\", not some caricature of a soldier throwing themselves on a grenade or a father working 3 jobs to support his family. If the Nazis had developed Nuclear weapons before the United States, as a happenstance of history, the Nazis would have been the \"Strong men creating good times\".\n\nBut instead, the United States was the victor in WWII. So they get to be the \"Strong Men\" and re-write history, and have the privilege of waging more war for the next 100 years. There is no ethics involved. There is no \"Good guy\". It's just bad guys vs. bad guys, winner is the strongest, the strongest is the winner, and gets to dictate the historical narrative, gets to control the news, gets to cash in on the spoils of war, gets to write the books, and so on.\n\nSecondly, the implication here is that \"weak men\" are a problem. After all, they create hard times. But weak men don't create hard times, simply because they're by definition, weak. Ineffectual. Psychopathic men, sitting atop the apex of human hierarchy, constantly press the limitation of what they can get away with. This is just what psychopathy does. And this is what creates \"hard times\". Hard times describes the state of the strong men, pressing down the bottom rungs of the world in their conquest of it.\n\nThirdly, hard times don't 'create' strong men(again, strong men is a euphemism for psychopaths here). Hard times **kill** weak men. Weak men are simply those who were dominated by the total force of planetary psychopathy, and led to suicide, were outright killed, or died from off-shoot causes of living in a world shaped by psychopathic dominance: disease, pollution, bullying, stress from being forcefully overworked by a \"Strong man\" boss.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1557898454,"distinguished":null,"edited":1557899401,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"enkm888","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bosb3l","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_bosb3l","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bosb3l\/is_it_worth_continuing_the_human_race_through\/enkm888\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1562194626,"score":35,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

In purely moral terms, yes - the people who are \"winning at life\" are the \"weak\" men, but this moral definition lacks meaning in comparison to the inversion. In our reality, the good people are the victims and therefore losers, and the bad people are the perpetrators and therefore winners. Life is not a Disney movie, alas.

This is one way to describe what the meme is trying to say, albeit in a highly confused way.\n\nThe second way is, for psychopathy(The perfection of which, across spans of time, determines who wins war) to function on a small scale social level, it requires coercion, manipulation, superficial cheer, kindness, benevolence, and so on. This is the mask of psychopathy. Psychopathy isn't some overt sadism, it's like a stick insect's camouflage. The sadism is operating on background process. The front is all smiles.\n\nThe same is true for psychopathy on the macro scale. It's all business, philanthropy and good behavior  up front, with the sadism in the background process.

The closer one gets to suicide, the more and more one appreciates just how hard it is. Sometimes one can wonder if it's even possible at all - or if the laws of physics or some other immovable force prevents it from happening. \n\nFirst, there are the risks. The uncertainty and neurosis of failing an attempt. The constant indecision over one's method of death, and appreciating just how poor the options are for most people on earth. This is a powerful psychological deterrent. Then the self preservation, an immensely powerful drive that keeps even the most clinically depressed individual alive. Then there's the paradox of the neurochemistry of being in a state where you accept death willingly, lacking the various neurotransmitters that say \"Okay, get up and **go**. **Act**.\" Then there's all the doubt regarding if it's the right choice. What if it's a huge mistake, and far more harm will come from it than good? Then there's the trauma to surrounding people. Someone must discover your body. How will family, friends, pets be impacted. Lastly, the existential dread. Fears of hell. Fears of some worse afterlife. The worry that it won't just be nothingness. These all can swim in the head of the suicidal - people who have already had more than their fair share of suffering in life. It's really just one of the most difficult and stress inducing experiences one can have. \n\nIt's true that it's possible for none of this to be operational for some people, perhaps someone dying in a good euthanasia program may hardly worry about these things.

From here it's just a matter of discovering if hundreds of millions of years of natural selection could perhaps instill certain attributes in apes who slaughtered and dominated their enemies, both as ancestral non-apes, and as the apes we know ourselves as, homo-sapiens.\n\nMany homo sapiens with \"preexisting attributes\" which we would both undoubtedly agree to describe as \"The sort of person I'd want to be stuck on a desert island with\", were slaughtered throughout history. The murderers, are our great great great+ grandparents. Many benevolent genes were slaughtered, because benevolence, unfortunately, only works in a temporary social state. \n\nLet's say we were a group of apes, or even a group of homo sapiens. You, zaxqs, are our leader. Let's call this group \"The Superfriends.\" The Superfriends are just about being great to each other. It works, too! Really, it does. Everyone's great to each other, life is, as a result, amazing. Why on earth would it not work? Welllllll... you see. Small snafu. Because there's another option lurking in the shadows. It's called a \"Pretend Superfriend\". What's that? A Pretend Superfriend, looks **just** like a Superfriend, with one small exception.\n\n\n*Internally*, this being is waiting for the right moment to crush you. Perhaps literally. Perhaps only symbolically. Perhaps he will find a perfect moment to carefully bring great shame upon you, zaxqs, unjustly. It will be the perfect crime. Perhaps, he'll just smash a rock over your head while you're sleeping by the ravine. Your spouse? Well.... Pretend Superfriend will just convey a truly heart-wrenching story about your demise, and be the arms for her to weep in. Since you were leader, this woman was the most prized female of the Superfriend group. But don't worry! All is not lost. The Superfriend genetics lives on, as a result of your widow!\n\nWhelp... more bad news, I'm afraid. The neighboring tribe has finally discovered your existence. And let's just say, natural selection **highly** favors them. They're the \"Superkillers.\", or what can be better described as \"Just average humans from back when it was a free-for-all\". They've come for your tribe. All Superfriend men, being the kind and gentle and loving and empathetic and dedicated and loyal beings they are, are of course, slaughtered and eaten to the glee of the Superkillers. But... what of your widow's child with Pretend Superfriend? Well you see, because of the genetic boon of Pretend Superfriend(Callous\/Manipulative\/NoEmpathy\/Skillful Charm\/Cunning\/Domineering), this child, who is now an adult, survives. If they are male, they outsmart or defeat or impress the Superkillers, and join them somehow. Or they escape, to find a new tribe(which they will ascend the social structure of to become leader, if they are fit enough, or someone **better** than them will).

Psychopathy simply describes a system that a social ape can use, to rule over over social apes, loosely speaking. It is an evolutionary checkmate in a social game. You don't even need to shed a drop of blood, even though there's plenty of wanton slaughter to go around still(albeit, getting better, but this does not mean that things **are** getting better, what it actually means is domination becomes more and more covert as psychopathic meta-game naturally gets more and more sophisticated). So that's one thing, now to the other. There are obvious consequences to being an asshole in an overt way. This creates the the illusion that many experience that goes something like, \"Hey, you know... this is a pretty okay place! : )\". Reading those last two sentences repeatedly can go a long way, I think. Back to murder, there's plenty of both small scale, and large scale slaughter that occurs today. From the small time sociopath thug, to the global, total, international military industrial complex which is literally incentivized to become a larger and larger leviathan that holds entire countries, and continents in principle, hostage. Every being alive on Earth is at their mercy today. But I'm sure this isn't a thought you remind yourself of during your morning coffee.\n\nRegarding psychopathy, to be frank for a moment, I'm certain that every single human being alive today *is* a psychopath, without exception. The status quo understanding of psychopathy, I'm talking about the *clinical* definition(Which is almost as bad as the cartoonish Hollywood version - both make people think of killers), is that only a small percentage of the population fits a specific set of criteria, and then the rest of us are either non-pscyhopathic, or don't exhibit symptoms sufficiently enough to be categorized. Here is why this is a 1)Childish notion 2) Is hilariously anthropomorphic. Let's imagine a visual aid here. There's Ted Bundy on one side of the scale, the poster boy of psychopathy. Then we move a long way to the center of the continuum, or maybe right of center, and we have me and you. People who attempt to follow the heuristic of \"don't be an asshole\", or better on a good day. Then, we move a ways off from us, and find whoever is not only best behaved but proactive in their benevolence.\n\nHowever, if we could zoom out, where do you think humanity would fall on the spectrum? Just how egocentric are we? How narcissistic, deep down inside? How manipulative? How superficial are we? How much **empathy** do we *really* have? The truth would, unfortunately, shatter any optimist's worldview. If you step outside of humanity and broaden the continuum to all potential behavior, you'll find humanity is hilariously unempathetic, egomaniacal, and driven to both **do** bad things and **not do** good things to a disgusting degree. And the reason why this is the case is perfectly intuitive -- it's called natural selection. This is the tragedy of human nature.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1558247378,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eo3k0ta","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bpx7t5","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eo3f2o8","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bpx7t5\/you_are_fucked_if_you_are_weak\/eo3k0ta\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1562865222,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Even the facts of mathematics require philosophical bootstrapping(We should value what is true, we should value logic).\n\n&gt; I also don't think it is about consciousness in that way since consciousness, to me, is just what it is like to be me. It is subjectivity. Just that alone isn't much.\n\nI actually think it's *everything*.\n\nConsciousness is the only thing we know of in the universe that can matter. If something is 1) Not conscious, 2) Does not influence consciousness in any way, actually or potentially(That means, it can't even be seen to be considered boring or horrifying or can't even be speculated about not being seen and how that could matter), it is by definition, the least meaningful and interesting thing in existence. Consciousness isn't what it's like to be you, consciousness is what it's like to be **anything**. Not a rock, obviously, since there are no lights on(as far as we know). Consciousness is the experience of the lights being on, and it starts with only 1 photon and goes up from there, to continue the analogy of light. Without consciousness, ethics do not matter, but not because there's no objective description of the way conscious systems can bounce around, but because there's no consciousness for ethics to matter to, in the same way there would be no one to add 2 and 2 to equal 4(Or attempt to add 2 and 2 and get 5). I still get this sense from you that you seem to be thinking about objectivity and subjectivity in a very boxed in way. There's a variety of philosophically toxic subjectivity that almost everyone rejects, solipsism. It solves the subjective-objective dichotomy by saying there is **only** subjectivity - mine. You can get gradations of this, which are about as useless. You can acknowledge others exist, but say **everything** is simply subjective because by definition, every single thing a consciousness can process is by definition subjective - including the senses, including our mathetmatical formulas, etc.\n\nIf you keep playing with this slider, you'll only get into interesting waters once you see that you can make objective claims about subjective experience.

It's literally the source definition. That's where the word comes from. It loses meaning if you claim that all humans fall under the label. It's like claiming humans are stupid. The average person has below average intelligence? What?\n\nAnother tidbit of grounding so we're on the same page. Let's represent the continuum we're talking about with the alphabet. A is maximized good, Z is maximized bad. A means it cannot get better for things which experience. Z represents the worst possible conscious experience.\n\nA to Z, A=heaven, Z=hell. You could literally sit in a state of X or Y or even P and make all the arguments you've made here. \"In what sense are our people \"bad\"? Sure, our world is a *literal* dumpster fire of a hell hole, sure, suffering outweighs ultra meaningful joy and bliss 1 trillion to 1, but... look, it's all like.... relative, man. There are bad people here who are directly making this place... not the greatest, but not everyone's that bad! If you call everything here miserable and bad, those words lose meaning.\"\n\nDo words like \"bad\", \"miserable\", \"suffering\" lose meaning even *within* such a scenario? It's obvious they are highly meaningful outside of it. But I'd argue they **gain** meaning inside it in a certain sense, because the people in the scenario a new found appreciation for just how bad it was. Just a warning, if you respond with some version of skepticism towards what bad and good are, my eyeballs will not recover from being shot into the top of my skull. The average person *is* probably below average intelligence, because we can already intuit pretty confidently that we're on the ground floor when it comes to the skyscraper of intelligence, based on being in a world where the gradient is fairly smooth from zero intelligence, to tiny amounts, to small amounts, etc, until we arrive at us. We can't go any lower. But boy, can we go *much* higher in principle for sure. In practice is another question, but it's not even relevant for grounding oneself. The ethical question is much more difficult to answer, because grounding ourselves requires way more abstraction, and part of what makes our world so bad is the illusion that it can be good. Which brings us full circle to psychopathy. Using the fewest words possible, Psychopathy + Time + Natural Selection + Large sample size = a Hell that often does not appear to be hell.\n\n\nEdit: Oh yeah, Dominion. Haven't seen it, but I know what it's about. I can already be sure that in the big picture, the point isn't even about factory farming, despite being only about cows and probably pigs and sheep and maybe other animals too. Watching the opening scene now, and seeing the cow's eye. That look in the eye exists in so many people. Wait. I can only laugh at the sadness here. Do you know what I just experienced? I searched for \"Depressed office worker\" trying to capture someone sitting in an office, or similar scenario, with that same look in their eyes. But... It's all stock photos. That alone says ten thousand words. The point is, the ultimate factory farmed animal on the planet in a truly big picture sense, are all the human beings condensed on the bottom of human hierarchy, sharing a conceptual space with all factory farmed animals on earth today.

The second sentence in particular is what I find most problematic. I will grant you that we don't live in a universe where physical pain is maximized. But this is where a continuum like the alphabet no longer serves us. It was good enough to frame good and bad for starters, but now we need something like a 3 dimensional matrix. In one bad scenario, we could be suffering overtly. But another scenario, the badness in the scenario is masked. Overt suffering becomes a kind of spoiler to the badness, causing the pendulum to swing the other way, rather than continually serve the interests of those who benefit from misery. This scenario could be said to be a parallel to the last in terms of badness, demonstrable on the matrix, yet it would seem [fine](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OW6BOut.png). But we can use our intuition and the understanding of certain features of life and the universe, such as entropy, natural selection, psychopathy, game theory, to get a sense of things *actually* getting better, or really just seeming to get better but in reality, getting worse? My personal sense is that things are getting worse in a way which cannot be easily appreciated, until they get so bad that it will no longer be possible for a human being to even realize something is wrong.\n\nThe whole \"getting worse\/getting better\" is another complication. Spacetime is a problem because everything is merely unfolding, slowly from our perception, perhaps instantly from another perception. We cannot know if we are in a seedling to something very bad, or a seedling to something very good, or how mature we are. Again, we aren't totally without grounding here and can make some loose observations. For starters, we exist in a world where know predatory animals like ourselves benefit from certain traits. And those traits, get better and better, until better traits beat those traits. Weak traits are dominated in some form(I originally typed farm here, Freudian slip?). Now, there's way to win here. You can't dominate domination, because then you're just the new thing dominating. That's the burden of DNA. And we become totally lucid to extremely broad facts like these, and then zoom in to see a step father saying \"I view children as pieces of meat\" and vividly describe how he would suffocate his 9 year old step child as he masturbated from the excitement of the child's asphyxiation. Or pan the camera to what politics appears to be in all corners of our reality: Just a circus of B movie level acting, plus enormous sums of money and power games. These two things are not as unrelated as they appear.\n\nIt's true that someone sitting in a very good universe making my arguments is possible, but it wouldn't say the same things as someone making your arguments in a very bad universe would, given that it's far more likely that a very good universe would be more apparently good, but a very bad universe would not necessarily be more apparently bad. The masking of badness is an aspect of badness, while goodness is more accessible without being ostentatious, that is an aspect of goodness.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1558284862,"distinguished":null,"edited":1558285073,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eo4twk1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bpx7t5","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eo4m7hg","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bpx7t5\/you_are_fucked_if_you_are_weak\/eo4twk1\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1562887039,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Here is the offending passage where you make the mistake, fleshed out more fully this time:\n\n&gt;Moral concepts evolved in humans, but NOT because they are picking up on some truth. Evolution is not about truth.\n\nWhen I said you were conflating nature with truth, I didn't mean you were doing so in a straightforward way, as in, \"What is natural must be true.\" What I should have said is you seemed to be putting too much stock into the idea that something was evolved in a purposeless way, therefore it can't possibly have meaning. This is the \"naturalistic\" error you seem to be making, perhaps it's better to say \"Anti-naturalist\". You could also argue that mathematical concepts evolved in humans. But this would be silly to say, right? Because mathematics exists conceptually, whether or not humans can engage in it. Morality functions in precisely the same way. We didn't *evolve* morality(We evolved behaviors, not **morality**. Morality is the description, not the behaviors themselves), we simply became aware of and incentivized to engage in a set of very algorithmic ideas that describe what is, and can be, good and bad. Much like we became aware of and incentivized to play with numbers in a way that is logically coherent, but in no way did we **evolve** mathematics, right? Morality is not as straight forward as mathematics, which is quite a neat system by comparison, but it's just as objective, and true even if no human or conscious being ever evolves a brain in any set of universes. Again, notice that the same is true for mathematics. This is what conceptual space is, and this is how you can be certain it's **objective**. One interesting thing we did evolve however, was the inability to change our minds. This was a very power adaptation for survival. Once a belief is formed, it tends to hold the believer hostage, because straying from one's representation of reality, even if that reality is confused, lowered chance of survival.

All you need to do is think up a culture that holds some invented horrific deed as the highest good, and realize that such a culture can in principle exist and would necessarily be defended by moral\/cultural relativism.\n\nYou'd know your unique cultural bias couldn't be culprit here, because you could find even distant cultures who recoiled at this. So... I don't know, imagine a culture that turns their school system into something that makes Auschwitz look like a vacation in the Bahamas. They torture their children maximally as a kind of rite of passage, with something like a 99% casualty rate, and then survivors \"pass\" and get to become adults and propagate the entire next generation. It \"works\" because it's a kind of insane, psychopathic selection. But according to a moral\/cultural relativist, we would have absolutely no footing to criticize such a culture(Indeed, according to a moral relativist there's no way be on firm moral ground in criticizing Nazi Germany). A cultural relativist has to pretend here and say, \"Oh yeah, we just like chocolate and they like vanilla. There's no way to actually make their social structure *more* ethical. The fact that we're so disgusted by this culture is merely an expression of our bias as a culture or as human beings.\"\n\nI think the root cause of this confusion is a poor approach to the problem of consciousness. What if such a culture experienced the greatest revolution known to... well, our *universe*, and somehow dismantled their psychopathic system for something where people weren't tortured in a systematic way on a planetary scale? Again, a moral\/cultural relativist would even have to ignore(in the context of truly meaningful validation) the experiences of all conscious beings *in* the scenario, even if they rejoiced and claimed they just escaped one of the worst hells possible. A moral\/cultural relativist would just be like ... \"Uhhhh... yes and no! If you say so!\"\n\nIt's really just a kind of consciousness denial that's required here, the broadest possible way someone can lack empathy. That's what I suspect is required to be a moral\/cultural relativist. It leads to a very needlessly confusing drawing of the lines between levels of identity, from the group, to culture, to species, all the way to consciousness, and it says \"No, this is all biased. None of this can tell us anything.\"\n\nThis is a sure path to be deeply confused as a conscious creature, and a potential path to create the worst hell possible, something I suspect no cultural or moral relativist would want even if they'd double down on the idea that there's no way we could call the worst hell bad, or as they would say, \"bad\".","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1558380676,"distinguished":null,"edited":1558387624,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eo92pqb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bqu1ym","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_bqu1ym","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/bqu1ym\/moral_relativism_examines_actions_whereas_value\/eo92pqb\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1562959200,"score":4,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

But the problem isn't capitalism, it simply empowers the problem. Capitalism is a neutral thing, like a hammer. It's **who** you plug into capitalism that matters.\n\nThe problem is when you mix a self-replicating thing, which is rewarded by doing anything it can to \"win\". Winning, it turns out, is dominating everything else. This applies to the baboon, to the child rapist, and to the CEO. These are all attempts for a thing to \"win\" via natural selection. There are no rules, in fact, the system **promotes** the idea of superficial rule creation, while in reality, creating a kind of obstacle course playground to select for the best psychopaths who can slide past the rules. If you slide past the rigorous legal system, you **win**, according to natural selection. If you lose? You get sent to prison, where you can attempt to play in the mini-game of that hierarchy. \n\nThe higher up you go in the human hierarchy, by definition, the better and better the psychopathy must be. Imagine for a moment a [leaf-tailed gecko](https:\/\/youtu.be\/EJGtN-igCu8?t=90) hierarchy. By definition, the worst gecko is the one whose camouflage is weakest and\/or behavior is maladaptive. The [apex](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/FNrprkF.png) of leaf-tail gecko hierarchy involves the **best** camouflage, by definition. The kind that **never** gets caught.\n\nHumanity is precisely the same, except our camouflage, is called psychopathy. Psychopathy is a domination software with a built in camouflage, which allows you to sit on the throne, smile to the peasants, have them **love** you rather than try to kill you, have the peasants **believe** everything is fine due to your manipulations, while you exploit the living fuck out of them behind closed doors. You're also a cunning and ruthless king, because all the other kingdoms fall before you. In fact, you will dominate the world, because that's just what the god of all apes **does**. Fish swim.

The natural state is almost redundant to mention, because whatever **happens** is by definition the natural state. Capitalism is just a byproduct a self-replicating tool using, socially constructing animal. Hammers are byproducts. Youtube is a byproduct.\n\nBefore capitalism existed, the **same** brutality was operational. Just think about how many good monkeys were killed by bad monkeys over HUNDREDS of thousands of years. The industrial era is only a few hundred years old. Civilization is a few thousand years old. We've been stupid fucking monkeys for **hundreds of thousands of years**. That's a lot of murdered monkeys, and a lot of psychopathic genes slipping by. Please rewatch the baboon video and understand that sociopath in video? That's **grandpa**. It's what caused the sort of domination that was required to set the wheels of capitalism in motion in the first place. It was the most dominant method, so it won. It turns out when apes playing king of the hill invent monopoly money, and whichever ape who holds the most monopoly money wins the king of the hill game, the game of monopoly becomes forced upon everyone. But **Monopoly** isn't the problem, the problem is the apes. This intuition becomes easy to trigger when you simply imagine an alien species suddenly adopting capitalism. Remember, no anthropomorphising! This species is **not** like ours. They are **not**: Nihilistic, narcissistic, manipulative, superficial, fake, bullying, callous, domineering, envious, egomaniacal, none of that, okay? How would a truly benevolent, mature species function under a monetary system centered around the propagation of business? Would it be totally free of greed and competition? Probably not, but only a totally intellectually dishonest person here would believe that this species would somehow be just as bad as us under such a system.\n\nThis exposes the problem: **Humanity**.

Just the losers in the race to the top? Or are we the aliens\n\n&gt;Hey maybe we are, I certainly feel like one most of the time.\n\nRight, this characterizes how I've felt since I was a small child. And early memory of mine, either in Kindergarten or first grade, was we would all walk down the stairs from class in rows of 2. One time, a boy tripped and tumbled down half a flight of stairs. Most of the kids exploded in laughter. But I was completely confused, and I remember the sensation. \"Why? Why is everyone laughing? That person fell down.\"\n\nFast forward and all throughout life it's just this pressing surreal sensation of \"Something is off about all of this.\" All throughout school. From being indoctrinated into religion, to escaping it, to growing up, to thinking I had figured life out, to realizing I was an idiot, repeat. The layers of superficial bullshit are very dense.\n\n&gt;It seems like you\u2019re saying there are psychopaths but also saying all of humanity is psychopathic. It seems like you\u2019re splitting on humanity tbh. Which, I mean, I do all the time. \n\nI often meet the criticism that if everyone's a psychopath, no one is a psychopath, because the word loses meaning. But I'm treating the traits in a broad sense. Not everyone is Ted Bundy, obviously. Some people can be called kind when compared to him, but pretty much everyone is a selfish asshole in some profound way, it's just that many people set up a very complex set of lies and deceptions to sustain the self imagine that they're good guys and\/or that humanity is mostly goo. We evolved to believe our own lies because they make our lies more believable - a win, in the eyes of natural selection, which doesn't give two shits if **you're** in touch with reality. My definition of psychopathy zooms outside of humanity. If we could somehow be on the outside, looking in, like if we were the aliens, it would be crystal clear that we're monsters. But we can't see this, only the most marginalized human beings get tiny glimpses of this reality.

I will now take the kid gloves off and try to present where I think these ideologies are deeply confused:\n\n**Conservatives** appear to believe the world is already reasonably just. Or it's unjust, but only because of the things progressives seem to care about. Economic mobility and social mobility are working as intended(or hindered, but **because** of progressives), or, at worst, there are no **glaring** issues(or again, the glaring issues are only a result of progressive moves). Bad luck exists to some degree, but you're generally free to become successful through your own hard work(Unless a progressive political move stifles the **true**, **deserving** winner of the game of life).\n\nThis view is expressed either implicitly or overtly in the equity vs. equality of opportunity tension. The problem is, there is hardly any equality of opportunity in our world, because everyone is a different human being, existing on a colossally large gradient of economy, background, genetics, life experiences, geographical location, luck, psychology, and so on. Equality of opportunity doesn't even exist in identical twins, the sorts who end up separated at birth to discover they have practically identical wardrobe choices, drive the same model of car, eat the same thing for breakfast, and so on. You can't even achieve equality there. The fact that someone could be born with a trust fund waiting for them, destined to become a millionaire playboy, while another person could be born to a meth addicted mother in a trailer park makes a completely mockery of the idea of equality of opportunity. There is **near zero** equality of opportunity, as it stands today. No one deserves anything, as a result, because you had no part to play in where you where thrown onto the court, or what attributes you were given, since your attributes and circumstances, **scaffold** your eventual positional success. As a result, success is only superficially relevant, but when you get down to the meat of it, the fact that you aren't Jeff Bezos right now and he is, is purely a matter of happenstance, and not because there's really something you could have done to be as amazingly successful as him, but failed to do. This is the precise way in which the game is rigged, which Libertarians and Conservatives appear to be totally ignorant of.\n\n-----------\n\n**Progressives** seem to fail to care about just how much worse things can get or why exactly it is that things are bad, because when you see the level of inequality that exists, when you see just how rigged the game is, you tend to suffer from a psychosis of self-righteousness and intellectual laziness to examine the issue further. The enemy becomes so clear that you can't possibly imagine flaws in your reality. This is why it's so particularly infuriating to argue with your typical \"Capitalism is the root of all evil\" woke character. They've figured it all out, case is closed. It's a particular economic system. Or it's guns. Because you know, if you give guns to, say, a totally benevolent and highly compassionate alien species, they'll be immediately corrupted by the firearm's evil magic and produce a bloodbath upon their once noble species. Or if you introduce capitalism to such a people, these highly caring beings would immediately turn into callous, avaricious robots, just like we are today.\n\nThe targets are locked on. White. Male. European. Guns. Capitalism. It's **so** obvious! Hey, pass that joint. Wooaaaah. Now it's even *more* profound. Wrap it up, we've got our scapegoat. Anything goes, of course. Feel free to reinvent everything, really. Words don't even need to make sense. You're at war with the enemy, and you're the underdog, so this is a guerilla warfare roleplaying game all of a sudden. Science? Who gives a fuck about that, looks like the enemy to me. Bunch of white people, after all. Wasn't *Europe* the primary contributor to science, anyway? But no, seriously, we've identified the problem, and it's a very narrow kind of inequality so just bow before the victims we anointed, and let's pretend we're not missing anyone or that our analysis is flawed or incomplete, and everything will be fine. Or else we'll burn everything to the ground if that's what it'll take to bring change. :)\n\n*a chorus of finger-snapping ensues, that drowns any rebuttal*","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1558415732,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eoafcbi","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_bqykkg","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eo90h0f","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/bqykkg\/steelmanning_the_crux_of_conservatism_and\/eoafcbi\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1562982146,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Not necessarily modern China, really any year. Pick your favorite, it's there. It's hard to look inward however, but we're just as brainwashed and powerless as the average Chinese citizen. The illusion that we aren't is an important part of the scam, because you can never realize you're a slave if you're placated enough to take your freedom for granted.

Domination is the name of the game. Why? Because natural selection favors domination, by definition. The most dominant thing has the highest chance of survival. When you factor this across the scope of evolutionary history, you dispel the \"Good guy vs. Bad guy\" Disneyfied bullshit narrative you're force fed as a child and adult.

Psychopathy **is** the stick insect of humanity, and it's not the cartoonish thing you see in Hollywood or with some failure like Ted Bundy. It's a perfected, camouflaged, callous, predator which you have **no** hope to ever see with your own eyes.

It's always something about altruism and how we never would have survived, etc.\n\nThis completely misses the point. I don't know the best way to trigger the right intuition in people about this problem. All that comes to mind is to drawing a really convoluted, abstract analogy unfortunately. The argument I'm making isn't that altruism is impossible, or never happened, or is even widespread to various degrees. The argument I'm making is that the phenotype of psychopathy **wins** the evolutionary game in the end. You could have 7 billion apes running on altruism, and all it takes is a few apes operating under a **perfected** psychopathy to turn it into farmers and cows.\n\nFarmers and cows is my convoluted analogy here. We aren't one altruistic amalgamation, and the existence of altruism isn't some sort of rebuttal to the psychopathic nature of humanity. Altruism is co-opted by psychopathy. The same way looking at cow genetics and pondering what is adaptive and what isn't, while ignoring the fact that another species utterly dominates the majority of cows on the planet is pretty useless and myopic. It doesn't matter if cows turn out to have some magical trait that is highly adaptive, as long as that trait happens to be useful to farmers as well, the fact that the trait was once useful to cows in the wild becomes irrelevant because now the headline is \"Psychopaths enslave Cow species.\"\n\n The point here now is that it's useful to farmers, and to understand the cow, you have to understand the farmer. The same is true with humans. Altruism is a red herring in understanding humanity, because **psychopathy benefits from it, more than altruistic humans benefit from it**. Read that sentence over a few times. The point stops being altruism, and instead becomes \"the jungle which provides the context for leaf-geckos and stick insects to become invisible\".\n\nAsk yourself what Psychopathy is. Everyone suffers from this failure of intuition for some reason. They think psychopathy is either what they find in movies, or whatever gets arrested. Both of these are awful representations of psychopathy. All psychopathy is, is a toolkit for ascending human hierarchy. Think of something better than psychopathy in a social, language-rich species. Just try. What out-competes a perfected callous yet highly concealed domination? Notice how much such a phenotype benefits from altruism. If you're imagining this and thinking of some ape being a sociopathic thug or exposed as a bad liar and exiled from the group or anything like that, you are very, very, very far away from the ballpark. \n\nNow, once you've answered the question, since we're discussing the creme de la creme of the species in evolutionary terms, what does the evolution of this apex look like across tens of thousands of years? These are the only important questions. Any semblance of altruism becomes irrelevant once you understand a specific phenotype infiltrates and dominates altruistic apes, where the **selection** is contingent on **undetectability**, like stick insects, geckos, etc. Undetected = Genes pass. Detected = Ted Bundy.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1558422904,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eoanwng","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_br2fcb","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eoakbo8","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/br2fcb\/lmao_why_do_i_even_bother_attempting_to_be_good\/eoanwng\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1562986187,"score":-1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Moral relativism works **if** and only **if** you ignore consciousness in a certain way, which begs moral questions. You need to ignore the experience of the little girl getting her fingers nail-gunned to a 2x4 for the virtues of one culture, and then also ignore the experience of the little girl in the precise same scenario, in the culture where such an action is repugnant. Why do you need to do this? Because if you don't do this, you cannot say \"Nail-gunning the fingers of a little girl to a wooden board for superficial reasons is **really** wrong, objectively, in the same sense that 2+2=5 is **really** wrong , objectively.\n\nThe alternative here, is to take an approach to ethics which hinges on consciousness. Why is pointlessly torturing children wrong?(Again, the question begged here is, \"But aren't you saying a culture's values can be pointless?\" **Yes!**. \"But aren't you just culturally biased in saying that?\" **Not necessarily!**)\n\nPointlessly torturing children is wrong, is because it **leads to an impoverished experience in consciousness at all levels**, from the torture victim, to the torturer.

Are we going to be solipsists, where we do the minimal amount of bootstrapping in exchange for having the strongest possible philosophical position, or do we recognize that's *lacking* in some way and worth dismissing, even though we have no arguments against it? You can continually move from this position and decide where it is you draw the line for what **matters**. You need some kind of value. A solipsist says, \"Only what **I** experience has value because that's the closest thing I can trust.\" While true, this is useless. So neither of us are solipsists. We can also be nihilists and say \"A universe of rocks has no values, because there's no one to value anything in such a place, and therefore, if you just add things which can hold values, you can be sure that values are fictional and contingent on some subject, therefore values cannot be objectively meaningful.\" But again, this is **useless**, while technically true. What would fly under this system? Well, take everything that can possibly experience anything, past, present, future, our universe, other universes, some multiverse containing an infinity of conscious experience, all of that -- and just set the dial of \"Hell\" to 10. According to Nihilism, this can't **really** matter. This is brittle, and uninteresting, and while, it would feel super urgent for us as experiencing things, to avoid, we can't **really** be right to avoid it. Nihilism uses things that don't exist outside of consciousness, to deny things inside of consciousness. This isn't philosophically interesting, even though you can technically do this.\n\nWhat I'm arguing for is to pull the bootstrap a level higher, and say consciousness has value because it's the only way we know of to even entertain the question. If your answer to ideas like this is to say, \"Well, sure, I agree, but that's only because we suffer from consciousness bias.\", then I'm afraid I cannot engage with you, much like we cannot engage with a solipsist who tells us we are fictional. These last two sentences are the **bullseye** to understanding what I'm putting forward.\n\n&gt; Does that assume that there can be only one correct moral standard?\n\nNo, it's flexible and complicated, and certainly not as rigid as it may appear. In fact, moral relativism is loosely compatible with a sophisticated moral objectivism, because it's still true that some behaviors could be ethical in one context, but unethical in another. The only thing you have to grant is that consciousness is what matters. If consciousness denial is the game, then there's no game to even play.\n\n&gt;\u201cnail gun is wrong according to moral framework A, and 2 + 2 = 5 is incorrect given algebraic framework A.\u201d\n\nAh okay, well now I see what you're really trying to say is \"You can't say something is wrong without rules. You cannot say a rule is broken without defining the rules.\" Well, sure, I agree there, but I'm saying the framework of rules is complicated, but objective, and is contingent on morality, which is contingent on the experience of conscious creatures. There is no framework for example, where the worst hell rendered upon all beings in all multiverses, past, present, future, is \"good\" or \"neutral\". There is no relative to the worst hell. Notice how all the relativist questions fare here:\n\n\"Worse for who though?\" - Everyone.\n\n\"Can't it get worse, though?\" No, that's what the word **worst** means.\n\n\"But maybe one day, it can get better, for at least one person?\" No. It's the worst.\n\n\"But couldn't there be some place where it's *even* worse?\" No. It's the **worst**, that actual and potential physics in all realities can account for.\n\n\"But isn't this just our consciousness bias for poorly favoring the worst hell?\" This is the point where we're slowly choking in a cesspool of philosophical sewage. It is on par with \"But can't I ultimately say you're just a fictional entity which I can disregard?\" There's no way to win here.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1558463224,"distinguished":null,"edited":1558487421,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eocsl5e","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bqu1ym","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_eocoxta","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/bqu1ym\/moral_relativism_examines_actions_whereas_value\/eocsl5e\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1563046355,"score":4,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

This isn't a very important fact to point out when there is a master in charge who benefits from your survival, and benefits from you being unaware or helpless of this benefit.\n\n&gt; If you think about it, normal people have an evolutionary advantage as well. That advantage is, building up a stronger group, rather than just a mob.\n\nIf you think about it, it's precisely the opposite. Because a psychopath has access to tools which a non psychopath does not. Imagine life being a 11 on 11 game of soccer(or football, if you're not in the United States). We replicate Lionel Messi, the best player in the sport to fill up the field on both sides, except one team has Evil Lionel Messis. Evil in what sense? Well, not some magical sense. Evil in a strictly biological sense. We have 22 perfect clones, with the only difference being the characteristic psychopathic traits in Evil Messis have their dials cranked to the highest setting. Domineering, Callous, Cunning, Manipulation, Deception.\n\nThe first thing to be aware of is many of these traits are what make the Lionel Messi that really exists, such a dominant player. Sure, he isn't murdering his team mates. But that's not the point. If murdering his team mates was okay and important for being the best player and he could get away with it, you could be certain he would murder his team mates. Not being an asshole, and being humble, are important adaptations for a psychopath otherwise they are ganged up on and killed. This doesn't mean they're not a psychopath, this is called the perfection of manipulation and deception. We evolved to believe our own lies, because it makes our lies more believable to others. This is why self deception is prevalent at all levels of human society. Now, cooperation is important to win, but this doesn't mean that psychopaths can't cooperate. The way a psychopath cooperates is by maximizing and perfecting manipulation and domination. What hope does the normal team have against the evil team? The evil team is just a more ruthless, cunning, version. The normal messis won't be diving as much. They won't be looking to cheat as much. While the evil players, are **just** as skilled, but they're do **anything** to win, including forcing their team mates to play better, to cheat better, to make bigger sacrifices, and so on.\n\nThis is precisely how humans work. The biggest psychopath wins, and natural selection selects the biggest psychopath constantly, as a result of replication, competition, and time.\n\n&gt; Lions are sadistic only to their food. Take that out, and you'd have to search hard to find the psychopathy.\n\nNo friend. I'm afraid it's far more grim than that. Lions are sadists because they've been selected by a constant [game of domination](https:\/\/youtu.be\/1x9zbO1-0Uc?t=212). I don't know how much more I need to say the word **domination**.

A common objection:\n\n\"But capitalism isn't like a hammer! It *can't* be pro-social because it's a competition!\"\n\nNot exactly, because all capitalism says at it's core is \"Compete to make money.\" I'm not claiming that capitalism is perfectly free of anti-social elements, but the anti-social elements are largely the product of **who** is playing. Sports are a competition too, and they're largely pro-social. After all, capitalism says **nothing** about how the monopoly money gets distributed after a round of the game ends. There's no rule in capitalism that says \"You must now horde all of your money to make even more money\". You can constrain the idea of \"Compete to make money\" in ways that are more or less social, just like you can constrain or redesign the hammer to be a better or worse tool for carpentry or a better or worse tool for inflicting the maximum amount of pain into human flesh.\n\nCurrently, our world has attempted to maximize capitalism for inflicting the maximum amount of pain into human flesh(By sheer accident, because this is what makes the most money). This can change, and isn't intrinsic to capitalism.

Capitalism is far more benign than your typical Anticapitalist wishes to believe. Which only serves to hurt the Anticapitalists, because it obscures the real threat to humanity - psychopathy. Psychopathy is all about camouflage, and not being seen. It is predatory. It blends in. It makes false enemies as scapegoats to distract you, because this furthers it's camouflage and distracts you - this is why it is the most powerful survival tool we know of, and why it rules the world. It certainly exploits capitalism, that is undeniable.

And we\u2019ve got this part of our brain that is urging us to be curious, look for the walls of your knowledge and try to understand cause and effect in the world. \"\n\n\n\nI think I mostly agree with you with the exception that I don't think a mystical understanding of evil is useful. Evil people are just unlucky, in some sense. They are lucky in that they dominate the world, and can determine if either of us live or die or get tortured. But they are unlucky, in that they can't know what they're missing. They were catapulted out of the void, into a body which would eventually contain the genetics of a long line of the most dominant, deceptive, power hungry, cunning, manipulative, callous animals that have walked the earth since before humanity even existed. They are the perfection of these traits, thus far. The only thing that beats such a person? A more dominant, more deceptive, more power hungry, more cunning, more manipulative and more callous individual. This is the human dilemma. Not capitalism(Capitalism is just a tool, a ladder, which psychopaths use. There is nothing wrong with ladders). Not religion(Religion is just a spiritual system, a system used by psychopaths to brain wash everyone else). Not postmodernism(Postmodernism is merely a cultural strategy to combat psychopathy or be a tool psychopathy uses against culture, to dominate it). Not light skinned or brown skinned people people(Certain light skinned psychopaths, rather than dark skinned, simply had access to the proper agriculture, geography, natural resources, and biological weaponry to win wars against darker skinned psychopaths and this is why the world was colonized as it was.) Not men or women(genders enable psychopathy in completely different ways - neither are the sole \"source\" of evil)\n\n\nEvery \"Core problem\" that people seem to center their world view on, no matter your ideology of politics, is confused, because the core problem is **psychopathy**. It's true that some of these other adjacent problems **empower** psychopathy, but they are largely distractions. As terrible as I agree that postmodernism is, even if you eradicate it tomorrow, you're **still** living in a world where the most manipulative and powerful human beings covertly dominate. This is how you can know what the true issue is. And this is a completely scientific, and simple understanding of the problem. Nothing else is needed here.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the song, just the genre I tend to enjoy.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1558543086,"distinguished":null,"edited":1558543783,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eofth68","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_br1twn","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eofs3ob","permalink":"\/r\/JordanPeterson\/comments\/br1twn\/chinas_new_social_credit_system_is_a_dystopian\/eofth68\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1563098916,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"JordanPeterson","subreddit_id":"t5_32jqy","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/JordanPeterson","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Other's too cobble their own representations of \"us\", and rarely do these representations match.\n\nBut the change we're describing would be a dramatic change. It all depends on what you require to hold onto identity.

Since you're young, I would prioritize how to think rationally rather than on specific ideas. Keep the ideas on the back burner, even the most widely accepted idea.

If you think these are equivalent experiences somehow, or a matter of opinion, or pointless suffering has no meaning, then please do what u\/dr-slay often suggests, and press your face into a fire and the meaning will quickly become lucid, that bad and good are real things.\n\n&gt;Punishment isn't to stop what has happened, punishment is to deter others from doing what said has done, to instil fear into them, or it is given out to emotionally please the punisher.\n\nThe deterrent argument is pretty weak, because people are rarely if ever deterred by laws. Crime is rampant because criminals do not care about consequences, this is a typical part of the psychology of a criminal. The idea of someone saying, \n\n\"I'm 100% ready to rape someone in the middle of the night right now, I've got my weapon, my gloves, a mask, I've got it all planned out. The only thing stopping me is that I can get arrested. Unfortunately. :(\"\n\n...is a fiction.\n\nAnd obviously, if something is done to emotionally please some punisher(Which is the closest you've arrived to reality), it should be discarded. You don't want to live in a world where punishers can please themselves emotionally with the suffering of others, this is easy to understand through the [veil of ignorance](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Veil_of_ignorance) followed by the [golden rule](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Golden_Rule). Even a psychopath doesn't want to be tortured by another psychopath, but such a phenotype tends to lie and take risks which facilitate self-serving environments.\n\n&gt;Revenge is just an emotional queller for someone already hurt, because that's how we evolved, and it's also a way to deter people from doing bad things, as most people seek revenge.\n\nI'm sure it's an emotional queller, but lot's of reprehensible things can be emotional quellers. Rape is an emotional queller for the desires of lust and domination, and we want a society that moves as far away from rape as possible.\n\n&gt;That's how humans work, in the past, we all have our own goals and objectives that just are us and we work in our own favor, many of us AN have empathy, or follow logic lines, which we have a belief in logic, because of its history of being accurate and all the other intricacies that we believe is why we should.\n\nHow we are, and how we should be, are two distinct questions. How we are, does not follow to --&gt; \"How we **should** be\". Slavery was \"how we are\" at one point. We \"are\" no longer that way. There are other ways to improve \"how we are\", and we should investigate them closely and reorganize society according to the results of our inquiry.\n\n&gt;Choice as we use it doesn't mean it's dictionary definition, you have a choice whether to respond to my message or not, that is a fact, you have the choice, you don't know what you will choose, and you have no choice over what choice you make, but you have a choice.\n\nIt's true that I don't know what I'll choose, but I certainly don't have a *free* choice. How meaningful is it to say I have a choice to respond for you, if my behavior is already mapped out and determined, as yours is?\n\n&gt;...Another way is the way I mentioned above, with punishments and revenge, which are effective as shown in evolution. We can do these punishments and revenges in moral ways I argue, telling your parents you hate their action, not being thankful for your birth, not doing things that were intended to be imposed on you by your creators.\n\nPunishment is only effective in creating psychopathic culture -- it's actually crime inducing, not crime preventing. Rehabilitation and treating people humanely, reduces psychopathy. The entire culture however, is designed, fundamentally, to **increase** and **test** psychopathy. To create low empathy children. To dominate each other. To test their ability to dominate. If they fail life's domination test, they go to prison, where they can play a new domination game. Child abuse is the de facto parenting strategy, again, to create psychopaths. Children are bullied in schools, again ,to socialize the most dominant psychopath children and separate them from the cattle, victim children. The legal system is another obstacle course, to test the psychopath to see how clever he is. It has nothing to do with \"making society better\", it has to do with creating a breeding + training ground for psychopaths.\n\nWhat you appear to be afraid of, is to lose your hatred. You are afraid of a day where you can not say to your parents, \"I **hate** you for what you did to me.\" And also some sadistic intentions, which are worth losing, since you are robbing your self of understanding that a person who has children is also a suffering human being, when you deny that they were doomed to have children. If being a sadist is more important to you, then there's probably no combination of words to fix that.\n\nBack to emotion though, the lack of free will doesn't prevent emotion, and even ethics doesn't prevent this. Emotions are human, and it would be understandable if you felt anger or resent. But you would also need to be open, to the fact, that your parents are not guilty for creating you. And they're not guilty for failing to understand that it was an unethical act to create you. You don't need free choices to understand this. There is a time for hatred, and a time for emotion. But these emotions have to be guided by rationality, or we will just act like idiot animals to each other forever, because the guy who you piss off will just say, \"Fucking Vio1auh, I'm going to torture him maximally once I get my hands on him for the crime that he did.\" It doesn't even matter if you can understand or confess to the crime, according to some random idiot, you are guilty, and now you will be punished. Maybe as a \"deterrent\" too, or for his \"pleasure\" or because he is \"bored\". \n\n\nSo a kind of emotional and intellectual sophistication demands the ability to say \"I'm very angry about this, but I understand you had no real choice. You are also a victim here.\" \n\nIn regards to your friends, it's always worth asking, \"Are these people really my friends? If I helped them, would they help me in return?\" And the most important question: \"Is bad company better or worse than being alone?\"","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1558735455,"distinguished":null,"edited":1558735724,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eoocvr4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bsk1xe","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eoo66or","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bsk1xe\/columbine_shooting_survivor_thrilled_to_be_a_mom\/eoocvr4\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1563244292,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

That goes out the window. The 18 year old White billionaire who just inherited their trust fund, and the Indian woman struggling in the Mumbai slums, are deeply lucky or unlucky, and thrown into their circumstances. The White billionaire has earned nothing and the Indian woman is not *simply* lazy or stupid in a way that can be praised or blamed. Their lives resonate like a script. Choices are made, yes. Moral and immoral actions are taken, yes. But the closer you search for freedom with a true openness to accept what you find, the more apparent it will be. Freedom is incoherent in a deterministic universe, and there is none to be found.\n\nIn regards to \"holding accountable\", we've covered this with the cat murder. You still need to protect people from injustice. Hurricanes have no free will, but you wouldn't punish a hurricane if you could lock it up(We've held trials for animals, because again, religion largely shaped our criminal justice system). If a hurricane had pain receptors and we decided to punish it with torture, we'd be ignorant to do so. To \"hate\" the hurricane with a level of resentment that only made sense if you believed it was intentionally and willfully causing destruction, would certainly be ignorant. This stays true even if you give hurricanes brains which are fully shaped by causes outside of the hurricane's control, and then say \"Do whatever comes to mind. You're free.\" Anything it chooses would be determined by parameters which are either outside of it's control, or determined by things outside of it's control.\n\n&gt;According to Camus the only real decision that one can make is whether or not to commit suicide. And yet even he acknowledges that within that decision free will exists. Even if everything else is fully deterministic, the conscious human still always has the choice to commit suicide. If we have free will even if only in this one thing then it cannot be said that free will doesn't exist.\n\nThe decision to commit suicide is determined and constrained wholly by variables that are outside of one's control. We each have our breaking points, and we don't choose them. Environments impose the choice on us, by stimulating us in such a way that achieves the breaking point. The happenstance of environment does not give us a free choice.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1558762827,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eopfp76","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bsk1xe","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eopa2c7","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bsk1xe\/columbine_shooting_survivor_thrilled_to_be_a_mom\/eopfp76\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1563309672,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

When we're young, and we're socialized, we're taught that the opinions of others matter. We evolved an instinct here too. If everyone around you, looks at you with a mean expression, and you ignored this, you just didn't survive very long. So there's a real advantage in caring about the opinions of others for social creatures like ourselves, even for some of us who are totally self absorbed and lack empathy.\n\nBut...\n\nIn a world where not everyone -- even most people's understanding of right and wrong, or understanding of reality is deeply confused, caring about what people think will only lead to suffering and neurosis. What's worse is, this suffering and neurosis is often completely unfounded. Who cares what some superficial person thinks you *look* like? Who cares what someone who, prevented as a result of political or religious ideology, fails you value you as a human being?\n\nThese people's opinions aren't worth valuing. Once you understand this, the pressure that these people exert on you will significantly decrease.\n\nIt's important to note that I'm **not** saying you should be completely indifferent to the objections of others. After all, **we** are just as likely to be confused or ideologically driven or suffer from personality defects as the people who we worry will judge us. So it's important to prioritize self reflection in a truly honest way, first and foremost. The worst case scenario is that someone's criticism of you was correct, and you won't need to live another day being wrong. This is a cause for celebration.

One's personality and psychology determines their beliefs, because it determines their openness to beliefs. Sometimes it's enough to simply question the ethics of childbirth once, and there are people who will be struck by a bolt of lightning and come to the right answer on their own. The same is true with free will.

Other times, such collisions are futile, but serve to convince spectators.

Is it so impossible for you to comprehend that I simply disagree? Are you even entertaining the possibility that YOU might be wrong?\n\nYep, I think we always have to entertain the possibility that we're wrong. Here's a demonstration of me doing that with the idea that you may be afraid: I have no idea if you're afraid. You could also be threatened. You could also be right, but to understand how I see you in that light, imagine us standing side by side, outside of a circle, containing all people who are certain that the god of the bible is non-fictional. We look into that circle and say, \"That belief *can* be true. But everything about reality suggests they are wrong. I'd need a lot of very convincing material to change my mind here.\"\n\nI stand outside of the free will circle, at the moment. I'm completely willing to grant the possibility of free will. I also know what it's like to once believe in free will, and slowly understand that it's an illusion. Have you thought about what free will would require? You would have to think thoughts, **before** thinking them. They would have to be unconstrained by variables outside of your control. It turns out, only variables outside of your control constrain your thoughts. That's our universe. A person who believes in free will thinks that the ideas that pop into their head are freely chosen, and the actions they take or don't take upon these ideas, are freely chosen. All of that is constrained by causes outside of one's control. What does this imply? Are you free, or is it just the illusion of freedom while you are pushed into inevitable thoughts and actions, by particles and neurons which behave mathematically and algorithmically? You are not independent from the algorithm. You **are** the algorithm.\n\n&gt;I actually would call myself a Nihilist and to me that view is not incompatible with the idea of free will. I don't believe that anything matters, but it's a sort of game theory. On the off chance that others in this reality aren't essentially NPC's I choose to try not to be a complete asshole. \n\nThat's fine, and I agree with you, Nihilism is compatible with a belief in free will. I fully agree with your statement that we should choose to try not be complete assholes, we both should suspect that we've demonstrated this to each other(And also both failed to demonstrate it to each other) in our conversation. \n\n\n&gt; It wouldn't say anything about the type of person I was if I became an alcoholic because I wouldn't be any type of person. It would just speak to the environment I was raised in and my genetics, right?\n\nSorry, I don't follow. Genetics and environment would certainly determine if you became an alcoholic or not, but we'd still call you an alcoholic, because words have meanings. \n\n&gt;And I do believe that we can't be ethical without free will. That is COMPLETELY different than the idea that you can't be moral without god. Without free will, no choice can be said to be ethical. Everything is simply the effect of an inevitable chain of causality.\n\nWhy do you need free will or god? If there is no god, a little girl being tortured is still awful. To fail to admit this has nothing to do with a belief in god, it has to do with being or not being a psychopath with no empathy. Likewise, this has nothing to do with a belief in free will, it has to do with being or not being a psychopath with no empathy.\n\nYou don't simply say \"Whoopsie! No free will! Just cause and effect! Sorry little girl. :) You too Mr. Sadist, please enjoy yourself, after all, we can't put hand cuffs on you now because, you know. Cause and effect. :) \"\n\nOnly a psychopath responds this way, free will or not.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1558820631,"distinguished":null,"edited":1558820827,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eosbk3s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bsk1xe","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eos491g","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bsk1xe\/columbine_shooting_survivor_thrilled_to_be_a_mom\/eosbk3s\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1563358876,"score":0,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

It describes the behavior of integers. The field of math covers what is known by humans, extends to what is potentially known by humans, but most importantly covers a complete mathematical understanding that may never be known to any conscious system. We would say such a system doesn't need to be processed in a cortex to be true - it has to accurately describe reality to be true. It exists, conceptually, a priori.\n\nPhysics is another such framework - it's grounded in Math, and it describes the behavior of particles and the forces that act on them. This includes large objects composed of particles, and large forces, and is truly open ended to account for the smallest possible description of something, and the largest. If science can actually or potentially touch something outside of our universe, these descriptions would encompass the framework of physics. Like math, it doesn't need to be considered a posteriori to be true - It's simply the total representation of reality - whether we understand it or not.\n\nChemistry and Biology are further frameworks. There is an actualized Chemistry - our current understanding. There is an encompassing of what is true(This could be the entire fields of chemistry or biology for all we know) whether we 1) have discovered it 2) happen to be right or wrong 3) can discover it some day 4) never discover it.\n\nHuman health is a very specific a priori framework, grounded in chemistry and biology. It is a totally objective framework, with right and wrong answers. How we can **know** it's **objective**? A patient appears with a broken arm. How do we produce \"health\" in such a patient? Wrong answer number 1) Take a carpenters hammer and strike the patients arm for an hour with it, using full force. The difference here, between mathematics, and another objective framework is mathematics rarely has multiple answers. In human health, which is still totally objective, there are gradations of right answers, and even potentially equivalent right answers. And even potential logical clauses, like \"Insulin causes health in patient A, but causes sickness in patient B.\" Likewise, whatever our current understand of health is, it is fluid depending on context. The answers for how to treat the abdominal pain of an Egyptian pyramid building slave, and a modern day Egyptian in 2019 may be dramatically different due to different actualized health measures as a result of scientific progress or ignorance, but that doesn't change the fact that there are right and wrong answers, and better and worse methods. Many of the same bad methods available in the time of the Egyptian pyramid building slave, and the modern 2019 Egyptian are the same. Example of objectively wrong answer: Take a knife, and cut out everything soft and wet within the abdomen. Even the answer of \"Is this person healthy\" could be different depending on context, due to differing levels of medical understanding. This context does nothing in regards to the objectivity of health or medicine - it only makes it a complex, modular framework.\n\nFinally, the framework of Morality. How can we know it's objective? Like math is a framework describing the behavior of integers, and physics a framework of particles and forces, morality is a framework describing the behavior of consciousnesses. Notice how we don't need to pretend as if it's our option to value the results of mathematics. We simply bootstrap this value, because we **know** we value the results of mathematics. Ignoring the results of mathematics, make us logically incoherent. We bootstrap the value of logic and math here. We do the same thing with physics, chemistry, biology, health, but when it comes to morality, human behavior is such a zero-sum game that for some reason it has become a strategic move to pretend as if morality isn't simply a description of human behavior with real right and wrong answers, that should be valued the same way math and scientific fields should be valued. Wrong answer number 1) Start your day with a cup of coffee, and then run to the garage, take your favorite powertool, turn it on it, and apply it to the appendages of your family, and then your neighbors, and then finally, apply it to yourself until you become unconscious from blood loss. The fact that there are moral exceptions does not pose a problem for the objective framework of morality, just like the fact that our answers to human health have changed for the Egyptians the build the pyramids and modern Egyptians, does not pose a problem for the objective framework of health. \n\nWhat do you say to someone who approaches us and says they just don't give a shit about math or physics? Well, that person is clearly insane, and worth ignoring. There's no reason to not extend this to health and morality, because what all of these fields have in common is that they are all objective frameworks, waiting to be discovered. What do you say to an Anti-vaxxer? \"That's just like... your opinion of health. We can't be right or wrong about vaccines\"? There is a host of ulterior motives denying objective reality. Some are a result of genuine psychopathy, these are the people who claim 2+2=5 in the context of mathematics, or deny biology(creationists). We simply ignore these people everywhere else. Not because we hate them, but because they aren't playing the same values game. They don't care about evidence or objectivity. They don't care about 2+2=4. They don't care about \"Don't take a melon scoop and run around abducting small children and collecting their eyeballs\"(Or they just pretend this can't be bad). In either case, whether genuinely confused or willfully ignorant or deceptive, difference of opinion has no bearing on objective frameworks.\n\nOther motives are fear and any interests at stake. Do you have a certain attachment to your current conception of morality? Or your representation of reality in general? Well then we know as a matter of psychology you will be vehemently opposed to ideas which threaten your reality, this is a very basic human reaction. Love your nihilism? Well, sorry.

You have given no reason or justification as to why we should value human health, or why the calculus necessitates actions or beliefs for those actions in any direction. \n\nI did, but you missed it. I repeatedly explained that we don't have to give ourselves reason or justifications to value math and physics. And what we do to people who question this. You appear to be taking the \"Why should we value health?\" road, which is to me, as disappointing and as obtuse as someone who questions why we should care about math, or why we should care about making sense. Can you imagine a conversation with a sense-skeptic?\n\nPB4UGAME:\"We should value making sense. This is a value we bootstrap, as conscious creatures. It is a self-evident value.\"\n\nSense Skeptic: \"Gkd%^jfsodf fsd%khjf w@#eiwsp am^as ds$df f!!?\"\n\nI hope I don't need to write out the entire dialogue until you tire of defending making sense, in the same way we don't need to take solipsism seriously, even if there's no argument against it. I could take the position of a solipsist right now, and you'd have nothing. **Nothing.**\n\n\"Demonstrate to me that you're not fictional. I'm fully aware of my experience, but you can be an illusion. If you can't demonstrate it, please don't tell me I ought to value you from the is your appearance.\"\n\nYet, I don't do that. You don't do that. For good reason - one which Hume failed to appreciate. I get oughts from the way the world is. Hume's dogma is just presupposed without any criticism of it being a nonsense way to approach reality, because Hume simply didn't realize what is important to value but instead had an alterior motive of turning an anti-moral argument in a solipsistic game - and he succeeded. He spread a meme. You can't get an ought from an is - well thanks, Lord Hume! You know what else you can't do? You can't demonstrate solipsism as false. Who gives a fuck? With math. Whether you want to admit it or not, you bootstrap oughts here from is's. We ought to value math and science. Why? Because the world **is** more understandable as a result. We ought to value ethics. Why? Because the world **is** more fair and just. We ought to value making sense. Why? Because then the world **is** more logically coherent. What we ought not to do however, is blindly parrot intellectual garbage just because it's neat and clean to say and it sounds right. We should criticize dead people's philosophy even if it let's us play a moronic, solipsistic game. Solipsism is unbeatable as well, and I notice you haven't championed that philosophical position? What ought are you smuggling there? You know, beyond the ought that we ought to make sense, which I'm certain you couldn't possibly have extrapolated from a state of the world - you know, the way the world **is**?\n\nIn conclusion, 1) I defined how health is an objective framework, by giving examples of what is healthy and what is not healthy, and explaining how this is fluid, and how this does not contradict an objective framework. Math is a description of the way integers behave, Human Health is the complete contextual description of the way human bodies can be less or more fit, and contract and shed disease and injury. Words have meanings, a definition of health is **not** \"an earth science concerned with the solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change over time. \", because that's **Geology**. These are not subjective, and the fact that the Earth changes over time or the rocks composing earth change, vanish, new rocks appear as a result of chemistry perhaps, say **Nothing** about the **objectivity** of **Geology**, and if you want to pretend an objective framework or precise definition of health doesn't exist in the same way, or want to be pedantic, be my guest.  2) If you genuinely don't think we should value health, please mutilate your face with a fork and you will quickly break the illusion of your health skepticism. 3)I explained how those who do not value health, or math, or biology, are simply ignored, as those who value ethics should be ignored. You appear to have ignored this, so I'm restating it for you. People who ignore reality, even if they have valid arguments(Solipsists) are ignored. Those who make absolutely no sense, are ignored.\n\n&gt;Even perfectly describing the facticity of human health, and understanding our biology and chemistry, you\u2019re discussing physical properties of matter\u2014 whether animated or inert, you\u2019re still in a descriptive realm, and trying to move from this to deriving fundamental ethical truths or moral laws. A move that, though common throughout history, is fraught with fallacy.\n\nThat's fine. Again, Hume is an imbecile, and structuring society on Hume's philosophy is imbecilic. Through Hume, we can be math skeptics too. I could say \"We should value math\". You could say, \"Why?\" I could say \"Because math makes sense out of the way the world is, and that's good.\" BUPBUPBUP... cAnTgEtAnOuGhTfRoMaNiS. Boy, what a fun game that is to play. Identically obtuse to arguing with a solipsist or sense-denier. These three philosophical positions all \"win\" ontologically, but winning ontologically is not always worth pursuing.

Through most of human history, people lived in groups of 60-150. So the people who live with you, would know everything about you.\n\nThis statement tells me we're not talking about the same thing. You know the guy the entire tribe trusts? The ruler? The fearless one? The one who engages in pro-social activity and his subservients froth at the mouth to serve him? The one who will sacrifice half of his tribe just to win a war with the neighboring tribe, where a more empathetic leader would have refused and been eaten alive by cannibals from the other tribe?\n\nThat's the guy I'm talking about. That's the guy I'm calling a psychopath. He doesn't actually have empathy. He's just a smarter version of Ted Bundy, that waits, for the **perfect** moment. And that's why, unlike Ted Bundy, he isn't locked away in a cell or turned on by his people - He fucks the best woman out of those 160, or the best woman out of any tribe they win a war with, and then that child mirrors and improves on his psychopathy, or doesn't. And the tribe which has a mathematically and objectively perfected psychopathy compared to said tribe, has a significant advantage. Ultimately, history will reveal the most perfected, and distilled form of the above, in the form of geopolitics, beyond these small tribal selection games, where psychopathy is at a **total** advantage.\n\n&gt;Also, I think psychopaths need allies for their lies to function. \n\nAgain, this statement to me says \"I'm not even **close** to understanding what you're actually talking about.\" You have a fictional Hollywood caricature, or neutered textbook caricature in your mind when you're thinking of psychopathy. If I ask you to close your eyes and think of an \"embodiment of psychopathy\", and you envision someone who has an above 0% chance to winding up in a prison cell, we are not on the same page.\n\nThe person I'm describing is the ancestor of someone like John D. Rockerfeller, or himself. Apex of domination. Apex of wealth. Perfect camouflage. All of these things, feeding back into each other to continually maximize domination, wealth, camouflage, manipulation, tireless dismantling of enemies when necessary, manipulating allies with social **perfection**.

The only time you wouldn't have a preference, is if you could clone the exact same dollar. Even such a **choice**, has a **non-neutral** cost. Even if we perfect the experiment and say you are receiving two **identical** dollars, there is a cost here, rather than just getting a dollar automatically with no choice. The time you waste choosing, is implicit in the cost. This is the opportunity cost, in economic terms.\n\n&gt; A more accurate experiment would be to put someone through the process of the supposedly equal pain and pleasure and then ask them whether it was a net positive, neutral, or bad, so the opportunity costs won't factor in as much.\n\nThat would change nothing in regards to the opportunity costs of performing something like that. And it also wouldn't accurately be an analogy to heaven and hell, because heaven and hell are two distinct and separate probabilities. We can change the original experiment to reflect how gambling make it even worse for you. **Would you rather**:\n\n* 1) Experience 20 minutes of maximum human pleasure followed by 20 minutes of maximum human suffering, or\n\n* 2) Gamble with a 50:50 chance of receiving *either* 20 minutes of the best pleasure **or** the worst suffering, or\n\n* 3) Resume your life as normal for the next 40 minutes.\n\n\nNotice how, if you are like most mentally healthy people, and pick option 3, you would still pick option 3 even if you get a new choice where there is a 50% chance you will get **zero** suffering?

There are more variables to worry about, but at the end of the day, the thing I'm most concerned with is firing the bullet as you put it, because the consequences of firing the bullet are totally unacceptable. I also agree with the points you raised regarding the double standards of birth control, which leave so much burden on women(but some significant burden on men, too). Fully agree regarding sexual norms too - unfair.\n\n\nThe hormone point is the most interesting to me, because in a purely fair\/unfair context, I think, like you, it's blatantly unfair to women and blatantly selfish of men(But i'm sure the fact that women have a lot more to lose with an unfavorable pregnancy than men do in some sense is a significant factor. Perhaps it's better to say they each have *different* things to lose that are hard to weigh against each other. Women have a ton to lose, though, no doubt.). But I see a broader question begging to be asked and understood - why is this curious case possible? Is it merely another patriarchal element or is there a more descriptive explanation that makes us all go \"Ooooooooohh. Okay.\"\n\nI'll speculate on that now as a fun little tangent because I think it's more interesting than agreeing with you across the board, hopefully I'll challenge your intuitions with this. Testosterone and estrogen are not equivalent in a causal sense that determines the **total** output of a society, competitively. Societies after all are competing with other societies. Estrogen *probably* fairs poorly from a, roughly speaking, \"Performance enhancing\" standpoint than testosterone does. This is obviously true in athletics, but it's also true in non-physical competition, because of the psychological elements of the hormones. There are contexts in nature where the effects of estrogen could offer a competitive advantage, and it certain does just this -- but if we could reduce the question into more abstract terms, and imagine two superpowers competing. Just clone either China, Russia, Or the United States. Pick your favorite.\n\nSo in Superpower A, all women are on birth control, and in Superpower B, all men use condoms. Birthrates remain equivalent in both cases as a result of sophisticated in vitro - no childbearing occurs. The end result is estrogen is suppressed in superpower A, and estrogen is not suppressed in superpower B. Which superpower has an advantage for dominating the other clone of itself, in all other respects? I'm not suggesting I know the answer to this question, but the fact that there is an advantage somewhere and an subsequent explanation for why that advantage occurs, and how significant it is, is something I do think is true whether we know it or not.\n\nWe can play with the dials of this experiment and acknowledge something less unclear: If we instead inject all men in superpower A with exogenous testosterone but leave natural testosterone in superpower B, the result of who dominates who is obvious enough that we can declare a winner. Remember these are cloned superpowers. This is how we can know that these hormones really do have strategic implications and the question of \"Who gets to subvert their hormonal system\" is really more likely to be decided by and because of \"What wins\" rather than by\/because of \"Which gender dominates society\".\n\nIf Estrogen was a hormone that lead to a 50% increase in imperial domination for example, we would be very surprised to find a world where everyone **wasn't** intentionally feminized via the hormone, whether they knew why or not.

You are not the protagonist of the story. You are just another egomaniacal ape, doing what you can get away with.\n\nNone of this has a single thing to do with Capitalism. Evil has as much to do with Capitalism, as it has to do with Hammers. Hammers can create and empower and relieve suffering, or they can be used as instruments of torture. Who wields the hammer, and wields the power to determine who benefits from hammers, determines if evil occurs(Close your eyes and imagine the most ethical hammer world, vs the least ethical hammer world to test this idea on your own).\n\nLikewise, with Capitalism, who wields Capitalism is what determines evil. Psychopaths determine who benefits from Capitalism currently in 2019, because we are a hierarchical species suffering from gradations of mental illness loosely described as psychopathy, which give us immense survival benefit as a result of millions of years of selecting the most powerful(Not the most ethical) strategy forward.

This is true in pre-civilization, in monarchy, in fascist dictatorship, in marxist states, or in capitalist states. All of them suffer from Psychopathy.

My post begs a few questions, so I'll try to answer some with some fairly grounded and not terribly abstract examples. I start with a very hefty premise, that psychopathy has been favored by natural selection as the objectively best system for dominating a complex social structure. The implication of this, if true, is that psychopathy becomes more and more distilled as you ascend hierarchies of sovereignty, including the broadest such hierarchy on Earth. It simply does not matter if the perfected, apex psychopath expresses something pro-socially, because such a character is by definition playing the best dominance game they can play. Only a more perfected psychopathy can unseat such a character. So you're always in a scenario where, if you're looking up from the bottom, you're interested in pro-social deals with the apex, but you're never quite the winner here. Cows, from the perspective of natural selection, experience a \"good deal\", in that our domination of their species allows for \"Pro cow\"(but really, pro cow-DNA - but even the DNA essentially becomes dominated by the DNA of another here, ours. It serves our needs.) deals. You can even argue for the things which cows objectively benefit from by being enslaved - no more predators, more no more struggle for food, and so on. These are pro social elements from humans, towards cows. But this is of course ethically pointless, because cows experience [cow hell](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3185) on earth. Likewise, within our species, the motives of our prosocial actions don't even matter - because the consequence is domination via psychopathy. So it's not that I'm conflating someone presenting their motives vs. them being motivated by meaningful morals, -- I think the question is useless given the circumstances of life on Earth, one of domination and no cooperation. Cooperation is something I reject ethically, because it only works in a smaller subset of social systems(Think an isolated group of apes who develop a hippie-like commune where they agree upon peace and love and minimize hierarchy). A larger social system is bound to discover these apes, find them as they sleep, bash rocks over the heads of the males, eat their flesh(or perhaps roast them alive, because they enjoy the superior adaptation: 'Lack of Empathy'), rape the women, and resume playing the domination game until a bigger psychopathic group unseats them.\n\nNotice how the adaptation \"Have empathy\" in the small social group, becomes maladaptive when the playerbase broadens? This is what my personal ethical calculations take very seriously. I notice all of your examples demonstrate small scale ethics, and I generally agree with you. But I think when you zoom out, much of our ethical intuitions fall apart.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1558989738,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ep1its1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_btmzz9","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ep1ck5p","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/btmzz9\/what_matters_is_not_whether_someone_is_principled\/ep1its1\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1563516566,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I'd just like to first touch the topic of altruism with you, because I feel a resolution to a confusion on altruism can contextualize my entire argument. If this isn't the case, or if you think the idea of altruism has nothing to do with what you've written, I'll agree to respond to your two pages. \n\nI'm well aware of the evolutionary advantages of altruism. Unfortunately, this science cannot cover altruism in the context of my argument. I've thought for a long time on how to demonstrate this to someone abstractly, and I think the best way to do it is by allegory which I call \"North Korea is the only thing on the planet earth\", which I'll dub NKOTPE.\n\nIn NKOTPE, as is implied, only North Korea exists in the context of national identity. Science exists, the Scientific method exists. Mathematics exists. Philosophy exists, all ideas within these fields, exists. Mysteriously, all cultures that have contributed to any intellectual project have vanished, and the only crucial difference is there is no perspective external to North Korea. \n\nWhat do we know about North Korea, looking from the outside? Well, a psychopath essentially dominates his citizenry with propaganda and despotism. From the inside, however - we couldn't see such a fact. We would be under such propaganda, after all. Ah but, couldn't we be clever enough to realize we're living in a dystopia? Certainly, but all the cultural elements of dystopia-exposure suppression would be in full effect. If you were to ever suggest you were in a dystopia, you'd be: 1) killed 2) mocked, as delusional, or a conspiracy theorist 3) suppressed somehow. Even the plainest scientific evidence would get you nowhere, because you'd be killed. Simply a benign scientific fact like \"Psychopaths are most likely to become leaders of superpowers\" would be suppressed by \"The ministry of science\", in such a scenario, because they are after all mere animals and will do everything to retain and seek power.\n\nWhat would it look like, if someone simply realized the plain facts about the nature of the situation of North Korea. What would these facts look like, given a scientific examination? How did \"North Korea\" happen? Well, the psychopath despot is essentially the son of another such psychopath, from whom he was granted the throne. And he from his father, and so on. How did such a system sort itself out? Well, there's natural selection. And the total phenotypes of the citizenry of North Korea, altruism and all, simply are no match against the ruling tribe of North Korean elites, and their psychopathic despot ruler. What's worse is, the ruler has a particularly clever adaptation - he's convinced a large subset of his enemies, that he's actually the good guy. In a purely DNA-centric context, this is true in the broadest \"altruistic\" terms. North Koreans preserve their DNA, even if they are oppressed in a horrific dystopian dictatorship. This is all DNA cares about - but what DNA doesn't understand here, is it's being co-opted, by a psychopath. Kim-Jong Un could simply access genetic modification, and modify the DNA of his citizenry at his will, because he sits at the apex of domination in the scenario. That option is his. Nothing stops him from doing this, in NKOTPE. Is that what we're calling altruism though? Clearly, this *type* of altruism is ethically uninteresting. It's simply **not good enough** to surrender your DNA in a contract that says \"Do whatever you want, just keep this ball rolling.\"\n\nAfter all, Cows do precisely this with their human farmers. To frame the situation more clearly, we **enslave** cows and the fate of their DNA is purely at the whims of our discretion. Not only do we enslave their DNA, we enslave the only ethically contingent variable here - the **cows** themselves. Cows are in [cow hell](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3185) whether we're in NKOTPE or not. Here's how all of this critically deals with altruism, these are the most important points: If cows could develop altruism, it would **not be a convincing argument** that altruism gives cows an advantage to stay alive in the conditions they currently \"stay alive\". I say stay alive in quotes, because they couldn't die even if they wanted to. If cows began smashing their skulls against the metal grates of their small enclosures(As they do, by the way), the farmers would be incentivized to drug them or prevent this behavior somehow, because they **own** the cow.(Notice the parallel to human beings and suicide, by the way). The most ethical thing from the perspective of the cow is to extinguish their own species, given that they're in cow hell. Cows cannot win a game against humans - they've already **lost**.\n\nLikewise, human beings who are being dominated in NKOTPE, have also lost. They are doomed. They are enslaved, by a group of people, who have a survival interest but have co-opted a larger set of people as extensions of their own phenotype, and genes which enable their position in NKOTPE hierarchy, to enslave. There is no uprising, because it's 2019 in NKOTPE, so every single tweet a North Korean utters to unionize and rebel is useless. Kim Jong Un **owns** Twitter or whatever the equivalent is, after all. Soon, KJU will have access to facial recognition, and a host of other adaptations. KJU's artificial intelligence is exponentially increasing in sophistication. These are all extensions of a larger phenotype of KJU, resulting from a selection game that took place over a couple billion of years. KJU is the equivalent of a Lion(a real winner) here, against a baby antelope(loser). It's worse than that, because the baby antelope has a better chance than a low hierarchy human against a high hierarchy human. Imagine a Lion with laser vision and titanium bones and pathogen resistance and... you get the point. That is the ballpark level of doom a NKOTPE peasant is in, facing against the mighty KJU. The illusion of democracy may even persist here(Sounds crazy in a place like NK, but anything's possible in an absurdist propaganda world), just like the illusion of \"altruism makes humanity good\" persists, this is all co-opted by the apex of psychopathy, KJU, and is ethically completely irrelevant in dystopian hell. Yet, most NKOTPE peasants believe in some sort of fantasy. After all, it has been a steady diet of NKOTPE propaganda from birth. Their entire meaningful representation of reality is a fairy tale. Another phenotype extension of KJU's genetic domination. This can be represented as KJU's DNA growing arms, and slowly strangling the DNA of the NKOTPE peasant's neck which too has spontaneously manifested. There is no defense, only a slow, determined, domination. Death is a mercy in such a scenario. If all of NKOTPE peasantry realizes just how grim reality is(They wont, by definition they are as doomed to fail to see this as a sluggish creature in the wild is doomed to fall prey to a trap door spider. Natural selection is **mathematical and deterministic**), the citizenry of NKOTPE would be wise to commit mass suicide as a final way of saying no to an unwinnable game. Likewise, the cows in the video I linked(Which I urge you to watch), if they had access to the requisite information processing and self-deliverance methods, would be wise to commit mass cow suicide. This is the only ethically viable strategic move from the perspective of the cow, because waiting around and getting tortured is simply unacceptable given the history of cow-torture(Notice how as humans, we simply don't care terribly much about cows even though we know we experience tremendous torture. This is a feature, not a bug).\n\nThis is the end of my allegory. Hopefully it has laid out a case for why I think arguments from altruism are ultimately useless in any system which incentivizes a perfection and distillation of psychopathy at the apex of hierarchy, creating immense and self sustaining disparities in power. If I were to summarize my argument in the fewest words, out of concern that a point hasn't been gleaned, it would be:\n\nAltruism work in fine grained situations(Small bands of animals, where tyrants are easily exposed and killed), but is less useful for the oppressed than it is for the oppressor in large systems, where altruism instead becomes an **engine of oppression**. The oppressor creates a system, based on altruism, which imprisons the oppressed, which cannot be escaped from as long as the oppressed express a representation of reality that benefits the oppressor more than the oppressed. For these reasons, altruism's existence is ethically uninteresting in a coarse-grained approach to ethics.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559005314,"distinguished":null,"edited":1559006406,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ep2araw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_btmzz9","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ep21knc","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/btmzz9\/what_matters_is_not_whether_someone_is_principled\/ep2araw\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1563529723,"score":0,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

This is the hell that beats all other hells. This is quantifiably as **bad** as it gets, given the totality of spacetime, the totality of any multiverses perhaps, the totality of physics, and so on. More suffering than this, is not just impossible in practice, it's impossible in principle. We simply remove everyone else from the picture instead of this one unlucky being.\n\nIs such a situation simply \"the default\" because there's no point of comparison?

Here, you cannot get permission. And like any other act of imposed will, where you cannot get permission, you cannot act. The exception here is when one is doing an absolutely urgent good deed. It would be quite off if say, I stole your shoes at night to polish them, ignoring your consent because you were asleep(pretend you were out cold on some hard sleeping medication). This is not the kind of good we're talking about. To steal your shoes here, I'd need a truly compelling reason, ie, they were rigged with chemical weapons and the moment you'd put them on would cause immense suffering to you - me, being the only chemical expert around, could diffuse the situation in a safe location, and there was no alternative. Being brought into existence is clearly not such an urgency, therefore, it does not fall under this kind of permissible consent waiving.\n\n2) Risk.\n\nBeing brought into existence creates real non-zero probability risks. Being forced to do things you don't want to do, the certainty that we will be indoctrinated into some form of viewing the world in a way which is guaranteed to be confused to various degrees, disease, bullying, the menial struggles of life, etc. Even if life is amazing, and you as a potential parent experience the best life Earth has to offer, you're simply not a fortune teller. You cannot know if societal collapse will occur before your child even reaches adulthood, or some truly horrific shift in the quality of life occurs. There's simply no rule about life that says \"We cannot descend into the worst hell imaginable.\", and to take even the smallest risk with the intentional creation of a conscious being which can suffer unimaginably is irresponsible.\n\nThe asymmetry argument is completely unnecessary for a cogent argument that supports Antinatalism, consent and risk alone are sufficient. Even in a Utopia, you can make the argument for Antinatalism because there's simply no guarantee such a Utopia doesn't descend into hell.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1559026607,"distinguished":null,"edited":1559026905,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ep3plvq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_btvljx","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_btvljx","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/btvljx\/help_to_better_understand_antinatalism\/ep3plvq\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1563554041,"score":11,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

You're gambling with someone's life who can have a profoundly miserable life. Simply imagine if there were a technology only I had access to, which allowed me to upload your consciousness into a new universe. You'd have forgotten all of your experiences on Earth, but the lights would be on for **you** here, a brand new experience machine.\n\nMy intentions are good here, but it turns out I'm not quite in touch with the quality of experience in this new universe. It's completely possibly that you'll be tortured for decades, maybe even an eternity. There's no rule that says you can't be. Of course, your life could be peppered by enjoyment, but the fundamental character of this enjoyment is that these are temporary escapes from a constant desire to avoid pain. And these are all non-zero risks, and some very blatant downsides are clearly very likely to occur. You're in a coma, of course, so I can't ask for consent.\n\nHow comfortable would you be that I'm gambling with your experience this way when the stakes are incomprehensible and so much can go wrong?\n\n&gt;The risk part seems somewhat weak, as although it's true that it's a non-zero risk, the probability that it won't go horribly wrong is incredibly low.\n\nI think you mean that \"the probably that it will go horribly wrong is incredibly low.\", and I don't think you've assessed the risks correctly here, partly because of the uniquely high quality of your life up until now. You've enjoyed a relatively comfortable life and are now debating philosophical ideas on Reddit rather than experiencing a [genocide](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_genocides_by_death_toll) or being [raped in the mouth by your father](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=985) or [raped, sodomized, and forced to live in a dungeon for over 20 years by your father, forced to bear child after child](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=OVmhZsjDT58).

This is clearly not your fault, and understandable. But imagine if there was *any* risk at all. Let's set the risk at \"Very low, but unknown\" that any of the above will happen to you.

The risk is well known for what has already happened. You are suffering from a kind of temporal bias, which in this case manifests as a fallacy that says \"Things have been getting better, albeit with major hiccups of intense horror, therefore, things will continue to get better.\"\n\nYou simply cannot know if tomorrow, psychopathic aliens descend and begin to artificially prolong life and torture everyone and everything - something which the laws of physics and biology perfectly permit to be possible. You cannot know is AI turns the world into an even bigger hellscape. You cannot know if the most devastating war the world has ever seen is around the corner. The **risks** of existence are not outweighed by the potential benefits in ethical terms. The idea of experiencing goodness, is not \"ethical\" when contrasted with non-existance, it is **neutral**, because it's **not bad** that someone who doesn't exist misses such an experience. However, if someone misses hell, that **is** good. This is because the nature of conscious creatures involve pain avoidance, not pleasure seeking, for evolutionary reasons. If you want to gamble with yourself, be my guest. It is wrong to gamble with someone else and then say \"Oops!\" when it turns out they suffer immensely. That is not an acceptable risk.\n\n&gt; to experience some of the wonders that life has to offer\n\nNon existence vs. experiencing wonders is a highly neutral weight. Non existence vs. experiencing horror is highly skewed weight. \n\nAgain, to understand this, one must understand that badness is more bad than goodness is good. If you don't understand this, then there's really nothing more to discuss. Your argument is \"risks are low\", mine is, there is no lowness of risk that justifies gambling on the worst experiences **for another being**. I tried to stimulate this intuition in you by asking you if you would be okay with me gambling with your experience, or ensure your non-existence. \n\n&gt;Is it ethical? If you're bringing someone into this with the intent to protect them from what evils remain and try and provide all the good that there is in the world then yes.\n\nThe fact that you put so much weight on intent is laughable. This value you hold to intent would dissolve the moment I would implicate you into a long lasting extreme torture scenario, all the while with good intentions.

How does the description of such a person change, the more they risk eternal, maximized torture? It's easy. The more risky one is here, the more they represent the archetype of a psychopath.

Most children on Earth suffer immense trauma growing up from their parents and peers just to accustom themselves to the meat grinder that is human hierarchy. Life is bad even for people who appear well off, because their position in life leads to a kind of ignorance about just **how** bad the world they're living in is. We don't look at a heroin addict on the peak of their drug induced experience and say \"That guy over there is **living** it.\" Your experience has to track the reality where you are situated, and yours, along with everyone else who is well off, simply doesn't.\n\n\nI don't rely on Benatar's asymmetry to say badness is more bad than goodness is good.

The dream like haze of your fortune is suddenly shattered by the fact that you live in ape hell. Sob stories pour in begging you for money. You spend frivolously because you're not the child of a billionaire who got to instruct you on how to keep your fortune. Slowly, you get parasitized by leeches and psychopaths who are rich themselves, earn your trust, and suck you dry for your last penny, throwing you into debt. Then you're in a worse hell than you started.

I too am not dismissing environment, I think the only sane approach is \"genes and environment feed back into one another to shape people\". Pretty much all of the best scientific writing on nature and nurture concludes this today.\n\nOne thing I would like to add though, is some genetic incentives are truly ancient, and any notion of their representation in our environment is an obvious product of environments being shaped by genes and vice versa. We are domination machines, and the fact that our environment is one of a range of subtle to overt domination, is largely because of our genes competitive nature in an environment of limited resources. This was true even when there were no homo sapiens on Earth, several hundred thousand years ago, and even hundreds of millions of years before that.\n\nSociety heavily shapes us, genes heavily shape society. Everything is feeding into and off of everything. What is the direction in mind here? To discover the truth? Or simply \"to win, at any cost\"? If you took beings whose genes say \"Win at any cost\", into a new environment of infinite resources, they would find new ways to structure themselves in regards to value, because natural selection is still operative in such an environment. Psychopathy is the best system for ascending a hierarchy of social creatures. Again, if your mind goes to Ted Bundy here rather than someone like Ronald Reagan, you have been indoctrinated to misunderstand what Psychopathy is.

We don't care about people's reports on life satisfaction, which is how this sort of polling is done.

It is therefore very difficult to even have such a conversation with a stranger who insists life must be worth living.\n\n&gt;I'm not defining good as raw pleasure, neither do most people as far as I'm aware. This is why your example of misery and bliss doesn't equal out, as the misery will have lasting negative consequences and raw euphoria isn't the best that someone can have. On top of that you're trying to create a net neutral experience, meaning that even a slightly positive 40 minutes of normal life has more value than that. \n\nWell, for starters, I'm doing the opposite of trying to create a net neutral experience. I'm trying to suggest to you that is indeed, **not** neutral. In regards to pure hedonism, it's difficult to frame the experiment for you due to language constraints. There's no good word that captures all of the good things in life - the feeling of constant improvement, a genuine spiritual epiphany, genuine feelings of love which only intensify as they are reciprocated, peak ecstasy of this kind during sex with someone who you are convinced is your soul mate -- words like \"pleasure\" or \"bliss\" simply fail us here.

We wouldn't want that, because hurting yourself is bad, no matter how much you're suffering! Please call this number! :)\"\n\nSuffering intense psychological torture as a result of a highly unfortunate life is something these people are completely ignorant about. Some of them are even victims of horrible lives, but yet refuse to acknowledge reality because they are afraid to. Or they want to feed their egos in some way. Many simply want to feed their narcissism, a mental health crisis that ironically *causes* much suicidal desire today. Some are covert bullies, and enjoy advocating masochism from behind their devices, it actually makes them feel better. Some don't even think critically, they just parrot something they've heard because it sounded good to them. They don't lose any sleep about the victims in life -- what they care about is if you express that you're truly suffering to the point of wanting to just go to sleep and never wake up, bup bup bup! Their rosy vision of life is suddenly disturbed, and then comes the fake sympathy(Not empathy, mind you. These self-righteous individuals have none.) They are literally more concerned about how uncomfortable someone ending their life makes *them*, than the fact that countless people out there suffer so badly that they would do such a thing. Just utter egomania.\n\nThe best I can do for you is offer you this as validation. As someone who also knows how intense things can be. As someone who knows what it's like to get a bad hand. As someone who won't lie to you or say your suffering is not bad enough or satisfy some hero fantasy by trying to invalidate your pain and offer cheap lies like \"It gets better!\". The best I can do is offer you what I wished someone would simply tell me, the truth. Honesty. An actual human connection. A feeling that says, \"This person actually staunchly opposes my misery and wouldn't expect me to torture myself forever.\" \n\nI staunchly oppose your misery. Whatever happened to you, was the product of circumstances you simply did not choose. You did not choose your environment, your genes, your upbringing, you didn't shape your brain or direct the firing of even a single neuron. If you're blaming yourself here, this is a mistake and worth thinking about as clearly as possible. It's not just unhelpful, but untrue. You are not to blame.\n\nIn the mean time, it's worth channeling the feelings your misfortune produces into understanding what brought it about. That's what personally helped me the most. Constantly try to understand why your life unfolded the way it Did. Try to understand psychology, personality disorders, try to understand how people become the people they are. Try to understand why the world is the way it is. Answers like these probably won't stop the external conditions which bring you misfortune, but they can slowly liberate you from at least the self-torturing psychological component of what you're facing.

The intrinsic property is in humanity, specifically that it is a fairly psychopathic species. You cannot say that the technology(I include guns as a kind of technology) is at fault if we introduce the technology into another scenario and there's no harm done. This is a really simple, rational thought experiment. The culprit you're after is the DNA that incentivized domination which improved selection. Psychopathy arises naturally from [DNA](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=19). We share 91% of ours with the baboon, another psychopathic species that evolved to not give a fuck about the creation of suffering. Technology is completely neutral -- psychopathy isn't.\n\nAnother thought experiment: If you take humanity, and plug it into a world where life is very non-diverse, technologically speaking. There are no guns, no pens, no knives, no computers, nothing. Just houses, nails, hammers. We do everything with our all-purpose hammers. We farm(inefficiently). We construct(tough without saws, our architecture kind of sucks). And  so on. Just houses, humans, farming, hammers, and nails. In such a world, you would have people who write essays about how hammers and nails kill people. Psychopaths would nail people to trees.

First of all, this is a kind of word game that creates a false distinction while describing the same phenomenon. Choosing what you will, **is** willing what you will. It is to detach your will from causality -- but doing this is impossible. If everything is causal, then it cannot be free. And it turns out, everything is causal, including apparently free choices. This is why it's called \"the **illusion** of free will\".\n\nWhy do you choose to ignore the facts that the burger is harmful vs. expressing discipline in regards to having it? Because of magic? No. You make such a choice *because* of the way you **are**. To be responsible for that choice, you would have to be responsible for the way you are. They way you are, it turns out, is determined by a **slew** of factors outside of your control in every conceivable case. You are *swimming* in causality.
