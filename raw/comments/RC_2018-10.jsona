He starts with something seemingly benign and uncontroversial, and then finishes with \"Murderers **deserve** to get life in prison\"\n\nHe even had me for a second, and then I thought about how senseless pride and fault are in a world where you simply don't pick your genes, environment, parents, upbringing, the causal chain of people, places, and events that find themselves in your life - the very variables that seem to, at least overwhelmingly, determine whether one finds themselves as a drug addict serving a prison sentence, or a world class gymnast. Murderers cannot *deserve* life in prison, because they simply didn't pick their sociopathic parents, or their troublesome genes, or the people and situations which the tide of life swept them into, and swept into them. We still want to lock murderers up for the foreseeable future, because the goal is still protecting society at large. Much like we still want to hand out parking tickets for the same sort of societal concern. We also want to live in a world where there are incentives for success, but I think pride and *deserving reward* can be separated from this by simply acknowledging the fortune of such happenings, a la: \n\n*\"I tried my absolute hardest and it turned out I was really lucky, and made it.\"*\n\nSuccess doesn't simply come out thin air, you still need to work hard to get there, but we don't need to lie to ourselves about how success largely manifests itself.

The children of sociopaths are incredibly likely to end up struggling in life, etc.\n\nI suspect that in the end the Free Will debate has a chance of being resolved by some really good psychological research. No neuroscience or testing when decisions are made vs when they enter consciousness needed. More along the lines of the work of Jon Haidt, and how personality traits predict political leanings, I suspect Free Will vs. Determinism is ... well, determined... in much the same way. Individuals who have very high self worth, pride, a deep sense of accomplishment in life will be more prone to a belief in free will and a rejection of ideas that suggest they are not the authors of all of their success, or have no good reason to think highly of themselves. Likewise, individuals who can be psychologically profiled as the opposite spectrum, will probably be more open to the idea that luck determines their shortcomings. If this is true, and that is a big if, it would say both views are determined, which is self concluding.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1539044979,"distinguished":null,"edited":1539045801,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"id":"e7f9r1a","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_9ledyg","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_9ledyg","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/9ledyg\/on_free_will_dennett_and_caruso_debate_whether_we\/e7f9r1a\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1540839928,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public"}
