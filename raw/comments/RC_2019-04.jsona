You don't get any freedom from it, alas. The quantum phenomenon you're trying to invoke has to do with the way behavior of small particles changes based on there being an observer or not. This is distinct by the way, from the behavior of small particles changing randomly. Our world would simply make no sense and be unpredictable if that were true. In either case, you have determinism or randomness.\n\nIt's already obvious why there can be no freedom in a deterministic universe. You know, the sort of universe where we both measure via mathematical formula the trajectory, mass, velocity of everything, and come out with accurate predictions that perfectly match our models? Humanity is not somehow... in a vacuum, when it comes to this determinism. We live in a universe where if you deprive a child emotionally, the results are quite predictably, and will only get more and more predictable as psychology and computing mature. Your thoughts, are also in this deterministic universe. Your next thought, right now, right after sentence, or this paragraph, is also determined. By what? Caused, for sure. You didn't sit there and create it, it simply came from the void in your mind. Can we know exactly what caused? Not right now, since that's very complicated of course but with sophisticated science and sophisticated computing, you can be told exactly what you'll think and do, before you do it. If this is true, you have no free will, Right? In the other instance, let's assume that quantum randomness can somehow untangle some determinism from human genetics, psychology, etc. Randomness still doesn't get you freedom. If randomness is what's influencing you, you didn't author that. If determinism is influencing you, you didn't author *that*, either. The idea of \"authoring\" something is completely nonsensical in a universe where the only games in town could be determinism or randomness. In neither instance do you get free will. \n\nAt any rate, one can only explain the deterministic universe for so long. I think the key here really is to analyze one's own psychology. We know that psychology determines political beliefs, based on the work of Jonathan Haidt. You're aware that you didn't pick the person you are now, right? You were shaped by forces outside of your control, during childhood. You're not any more \"Free\" to become a serial killer this moment(Unless you're predisposed) than you are to drop all of your political beliefs and switch over to the other side. It would be characteristic of a psychotic episode if that suddenly happened to you(Tangent: this is fun to frame in the context of one having free will - would you call a psychotic episode free? What about one caused by the development of a brain tumor, or a head injury?)\n\nI think belief in free will is very much like the adoption of political beliefs - correlated with one's personality. If one is high in egocentrism, for instance, it would make very little sense for someone to believe they are nothing but meat robots shaped by one's environment, whose own achievements are nothing but configuration of luck. A strong sense of self(Or to speak less euphemistically, having a massive ego or narcissistic qualities), should therefore positively correlate with a rejection of the determinism. Out of curiousity, what would cause you to drop your belief in free will? If a supercomputer could show you a rendered video it recorded 2 days ago, of the first few hours of everything you did and said today, would that do it for you?\n\n\n","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1554148304,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ejwaz2s","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_b74dq0","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ejw7y63","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/b74dq0\/some_important_truths_are_scientifically\/ejwaz2s\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1557235756,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I've already entertained countless \"God like being tampering with reality\" scenarios. Most people dismiss thought experiments on the grounds that they sound absurd or nitpicking an irrelevant detail rather than distilling the point or finding a genuine flaw in the reasoning\/logic, so I will try my best not to do that.\n\nIs it possible that there are entities which monitor our universe(or perhaps are even internal to our universe) and are incentivized to fabricate a not fully deterministic reality? Certainly that's possible. But again, in your example, your man getting kicked in the nuts rather than eating the donut for the billionth time would be a victim of a causal force, right? So there's no free will there. It's just an appearance of randomness, from the perspective of the donut eater(But really, with a totally omniscient view of the situation, or really just being ourselves as observers here, we can see it's just another causal event).\n\nIf your argument is \"Free will could be possible outside of our universe\", I have no reason to dispute that possibility.\n\n\nRe: Your time traveling question, that would not bring you free will, because your decision to time travel rests on causal factors. It gets complicated to think about, but the very act of time traveling would itself be a point on the tape, which you would be determined to either perform or not perform, based on variables outside of your control. We must also make room for the tape being split in two or even infinitely fragmented. That's when it gets more complicated to think about, but the causal nature never goes away, even when you introduce infinity into the picture.\n\n\n\n\n","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1554230742,"distinguished":null,"edited":1554230942,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ejyt2fi","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_b74dq0","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ejxqezp","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/b74dq0\/some_important_truths_are_scientifically\/ejyt2fi\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1557278212,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

We live in the sort of world where, there are fairly reliable \"recipes\" to creating people. \n\nRecipe number 1 - Raise a child as you would treat a fighting pitbull from age 9 to 21. This recipe very reliably yields a psychopath. We can split hairs about the complexity involved here. Is it the genes that turn on in response to the environment, would the genes have turned on either way? Is it the environment that suppresses the genes, and\/or does it all feed into itself in a complex manner? Is it more about what one doesn't do, than what one does do, to the child? If you can't grant that we live in this sort of world, there's really no point in reading onwards. To have this kind of discussion really does require an ability to admit that if ethics were of no concerns(Perhaps we could use one of those nifty supercomputers we discussed earlier to run a simulation), and we took a thousand children and beat the fucking shit out of them, we would get severely psychologically damaged children, many of which, if they survived, would be psychopaths. Again, if this representation of our world is super controversial to you, we're not going to get anywhere. If your response is \"Well it's *possible* they could come out of this as well-adapted adults and use their will to transcend their abusive paaaaast\" as you scuff your shoes in the dirt, we will indeed get nowhere.\n\nWe live in a *fairly* deterministic universe. Deterministic how? Not random in the sense that if you deeply emotionally deprive children, you get children that can't be called psychologically healthy. Very, very, very, very often. If you indoctrinate children in just the right way, you get ... well, children, indoctrinated in just the right way. \n\nThis all occurs fairly reliably. Are there outliers? Obviously. But the deterministic nature of the development of the self is overbearing here, *not* the fact that outliers exist. To look at the mountain of deterministic qualities involving development of self, the mind, and thoughts themselves, and then to say, \"Wait! There's something not **perfectly** deterministic here! This is where I'll smuggle free will in!\" is just utterly dishonest. \n\nWhat do you think the conclusion is, if your environment literally can shape the very occurrence of a thought like \"I'd love that have sex with that child over there\" vs. \"I'm not fond of that particular kind of cheese\" vs. \"I love hard work!\" vs \"I'm too depressed to get out of bed...\" ","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1554239098,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ejz6423","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_b74dq0","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ejz4g14","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/b74dq0\/some_important_truths_are_scientifically\/ejz6423\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1557284331,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

At no point have I said that choice must be totally non-constrained in order to be free, so the fact that people who were abused as children cannot magically will themselves to be free of trauma is not an issue for my view.\n\nThat's actually not what I'm attributing to you, what I am attributing to you is a failure to acknowledge the causes, which are outside of one's 1) awareness 2) control, influencing what you're calling a freely made choice. The fact that sheer happenstance and vast neurological and psychological diversity present a vast array of unconscious causes that lead to dramatically different thoughts, actions, and lives, doesn't make you bat an eyebrow. Let's look at your definition very closely?\n\n&gt;A will is unfree when the system as a whole is entirely determined by the environment, as in the case of hard determinism, an unconscious subject or someone whose capacities as an individual have been impaired to the point of non-operation.\n\nNow we're getting somewhere. A will is actually unfree when you are not aware of all the factors that determine your thoughts and actions, and you lack control over those factors. The closer you examine this problem, narrower the gap for what you're calling freedom becomes, until finally, one discovers, there is actually not the slightest drop of freedom to be found anywhere, because unconscious processes, and factors like genetics, environment, upbringing, largely **determine** who you are, and what you think. This **include** any \"Free-feeling\" choices. Therefore no choice is free. Even the most free choice you could possibly imagine right now, is nonsensical, because it is at the mercy of unconscious processes and variables that \"chooser\" did not author or has awareness of. It's as simple as that.\n\nThe very idea that we can sit here right now, and respond to each other another time, or another 10 times, or stop the discussion, do you get the sensation that this rests on a real choice either of us can make? Or just this brittle sensation of choice, draped over endless causes relating to our neurology and psychology?\n\n&gt;For free will to exist on my view is for the conscious mind (as the subjective overlay of the total system) to be capable of constraining and directing its causal relations, in other words, to act in ways other than an entity without conscious experience would (at the most extreme end) or in ways beyond mere animal reactions (at a less extreme gradient)\n\nThis is a very nimble, but problematic definition, because that is just determinism with a consciousness overlay. That isn't freedom. Your view is perfectly appealing for a conscious mind who suffers from an illusion that it can constrain and direct it's causal relations(while being largely completely unaware of them or it's own programming), unlike a mere unconscious robot. You are not aware of what causes your thoughts to arise. This is not a controversial concept. You can come up with a story, but there's no evidence your story actually reliably relates to reality, because the mind is largely unconscious. It's unconsciousness, in fact, that gives rise to ego and illusions of free will, because if our brains were simply supercomputers with an overabundance of RAM, that could track every single bit of information we've ever come in contact with, the deterministic and algorithmic nature of behavior and thought would be plain to see.\n\nWhy is one sexually promiscuous? Well, it's not a mystery - it turns out one was sexually abused as a child. Could one be sexually promiscuous without being sexually abused? Probably. What are the causal **determinants** of that behavior? Who knows, but they're there - and they logically explain the behavior in a complete way.\n\nFrom the experience of the ego driven subject, they're merely exercising their will to have sex. But in reality, they're just a robot who doesn't understand that it's a robot.

Some part of this isn't even biological but cultural - cultures have their own interests as sets of ideas and genes that complete against other sets of ideas and genes.

That's another way of looking at it.\n\nBut yes, at the individual level our genes are incentivized to not only spread, but dominate other genes because it allows for proliferation of said gene to kill it's competition.

Psychology is the science of the mind, and child psychology is the science of children's minds. Should you subject your child to \"tough love\", or less euphemistically, should you verbally abuse(Or physically? Spare the rod, spoil the child?) children with the intention of toughening them up?\n\nI haven't looked into it, but my intuition tells me abusing children verbally(or physically, for that matter) develops psychopathic traits. That's *actually* what \"toughening\" is. There is no scientific term called \"Toughening\". What you're doing when you shit on a child is you tell their body and mind \"You cannot be sensitive. If you are sensitive, you will *not* survive in this environment\". You are forcing the child to not be kind to others, by teaching them cruelty. The key thing to understand here is this is not purely negative from a survival perspective. It's purely(probably) negative from an ethical perspective, but from the point of view of survival, grooming your children to be psychopaths, and being a psychopath, has adaptive advantages in a dog-eat-dog world.\n\nSo you dull the child. You lower their empathy. You lower their curiosity. You turn them into a zombie or an asshole, perfectly suited for a cruel world - perfectly suited for hard work, perhaps the ideal soldier, or simply manipulating and dominating their fellow person. Part of this is genetic, and these traits can exist in a child without any environmental influence.\n\nThese are all evolutionary and cultural strategies, of course. You can play a little thought experiment in your head to test this idea. Imagine an alien species on some distant planet. This species is much like us, has language, culture, all that jazz, but there are only 2 competing cultures, recently introduced to each other because of a geographic change that re-united the two cultures after a breach that isolated them 1,000 years ago. One culture, culture A, doesn't subject their children to any negativity, and only uses positive reinforcement. They don't dominate each other in a meaningful way to ascend their cultural hierarchy - these are essentially alien hippies. The other culture brutalizes their children from early on, which \"toughens\" them, which makes people capable of grueling hard work, creates a \"no mercy\" kind of environment for ascending and dominating their culture's heirarchy. Culture A is obviously the happier culture, and culture B is obviously pretty miserable. \n\nBut...\n\nSuppose these cultures go to war, because like on Earth, in this planet the species competes in a tribal way for resources, survival, and domination. \n\nWhich of these two cultures is more likely to win a war against the other? The psychopathic culture would absolutely murder the \"kind hippie\" culture. The kind culture wouldn't even know what hit them. It would be like childs play to dominate and subjugate others, as a psychopathic culture.\n\nIf you understand this, you understand much of human history - and the evolutionary incentive for individual, cultural, and *institutional* psychopathy.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1554398927,"distinguished":null,"edited":1554428841,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ek460m6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_b996tt","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_b996tt","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/b996tt\/giving_young_people_negative_comments_so_that\/ek460m6\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1557368962,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Almost no one schemes to themselves and says \n\n\"Yesss! I can be an asshole to my child, *claim* I'm just providing \"tough love\", and no one will be the wiser! HAHAHA!\"\n\nThere are real explanations for why people are assholes. That's a scientific question. *Should* people be assholes, is an ethical question with different answers depending on the context. If you understand that human behavior is nothing but a selected, and selective, set of strategies\/vestiges with the potential to propagate genes, you can look at conditions like psychopathy or even just \"being an asshole\" differently. Helping your child deal with emotions is certainly one strategy, as you mention, and if done well it should be successful in a specific sense. But it's not the only strategy, and it's not even clear if it's the best strategy from the point of view of the genetic race. Another strategy is to groom your child into a psychopath by treating them less like a child and more like a pitbull meant for illegal dogfighting. You'll make a monster, which from the point of view of ethics is obviously terrible. From the point of view of say, a tribe\/nation's millitary it's not so bad. From the point of view of a mate, again, it's counterintuitive but time and time again it shows that assholes fare better in spreading their genes - it makes sense why that is. From the point of view of the genes, a monster has better odds of propagating genes in the long term(Long in the sense of beyond a single individual's life span). I'm using words like monster very loosely. The people I'm calling monsters here(which is a shitty word because it adds negative baggage but I don't necessarily see it that way), could both be the thug in the wife beater with the criminal record and not a drop of empathy, or it could be the smug asshole in the suit(Who few actually realize is an asshole because hey, psychopathy is kind of magical) who has made a fortune manipulating everyone in his way.\n\nBoth of these stereotypes, and strategies, lead to successfully passing on one's genes. There will probably be a shift from the latter being significantly more valued and the former devalued, because thuggish sociopathy was valuable and attractive when humanity was less technologically advanced, but now psychopathy appears to be the highest value strategy for propagation of genes, mostly because this genotype tends to dominate \"nice parenting\" or \"Non\/less-psychopathic\" genotypes, so we could see a distillation of psychopathy in human hierarchy as time passes.

If you reject free will, it's obvious why slaves have children - When you're a meat robot with strong drives to reproduce, you tend to.... reproduce. \n\nIf we went back in time and discovered that slaves actually had a mind control implant in their brains that fired neurons making them want to fuck, and let's say the timeless cosmic court of ethics was holding the souls of these Slaves on trial for the crime of natalism, would you dismiss the accusation as a result of the evidence of such a mind control device? If you're sane, you will. \n\nNow there's no difference in principle, between this device, and actual human impulse. Nuerons fire, you get impulses, you either resist the impulse or you don't. If you resist it, you had the brain of someone who could resist it, by definition. If you couldn't resist it, then **resisting it was not in the cards from a neurological\/physics standpoint**, at that moment in time. If you still don't get it, imagine a baseball in mid air. People who argue that you have free will, basically pretend we live in a world where the baseball's velocity or directional movement or some other property of physics can change at random. The baseball is going somewhere. At a precise speed, in a precise direction. Your neurons are no different. You're still reading this sentence, why? Why haven't you walked away? Is it because you chose not to? Why did someone *else* who isn't you, walk away two sentences ago? If you had his brain, you'd be gone. If he had your brain, he'd be here right now. Yet both of you pretend as if you're making a choice and can leave any time you want because you're somehow the boss of your neurology. You're the boss of nothing, shit just happens in your brain and you do it and then make shit up about why you did it post hoc. Why do you think you're not entertaining sexual fantasies about children right now? It's because happenstance made it so you didn't get the brain of a pedophile.

Humanity dominates each other in subtle and not so subtle ways, because evolution is essentially a huge genetic marathon which incentivizes this. Psychopathy and psychopathic behavior is just a genetic strategy that has coalesced and is currently in the running. So from an ethical perspective, psychopathic behavior is irrational. But from the evolutionary history it has a strong track record for 1) Ascending human hierarchy at all levels 2) Reproducing.\n\nThe point of my post is to illustrate how it's not always the best approach to look at the topic of any toxic behavior and critiquing it from a ethical standpoint while assessing it's rationality. You can do it, and it's valuable. It's valuable to say \"Child abuse is wrong.\" for instance, from a moral perspective. If you're a conscious system in an unconscious universe, it's rational and logical to shape your universe in a way that doesn't create something resembling hell.\n\nBut you have to understand *why* these things exist in the first place though, or they will just seem irrational. This is what makes a lot of irrational behavior rational in a certain context. Obviously, toxic behavior is... well, toxic. It reliably makes more people miserable than not.

The reason is, in the most simple nutshell, in large communities, heartless monsters survive better than kind people. In small communities, heartless monsters are exiled. Small communities don't have room for monsters , because small communities need cooperation to survive. Big communities, like the ones we live in, don't need cooperation. So the psychopathic model is the survivor model. And that is the core reason for why life is hell right now.

Here's how you can trigger this intuition on your own. Imagine the smallest simulation of a selection game you can imagine. Just a universe with infinite darkness, and only 2 things in it. Any 2 things, but the stipulation is, one thing beats the other thing somehow, or, gets **selected**. And now that thing is the only thing, and the other thing that didn't get selected, is gone. I say \"thing\" rather than \"Animal\" or \"person\" because there's no need to add more complexity. We're just looking at the simplest selection we can possibly imagine. \n\nNow just pretend you have a mechanical dial labeled \"vastness\/complexity\". And you just turn this dial a hair, and suddenly, you have much more selection and much more complexity. The more you turn this dial, the more properties like(But not necessarily) pain receptors, or visual receptors, or consciousness emerges from this selection. The more you run this simulation, the more obvious it is why life \"proceeds to exist while it suffers\". You will see little axioms in this simulation game pop up over time. Maybe one of the first rules is \"Pain is always bad\". If you follow this rule, you get selected. But maybe you're following the rule too extremely, right? Maybe you starve to death or don't reproduce because pain is so bad to you. Again, you are selected, and the rules change as a result. Now the rule is \"Pain is bad except when it leads to good things\". It keeps changing this way, just as the players in the game change.\n\nNow fast forward to our reality and we have something that we'd struggle to coherently talk about due to the insane complexity, but what we can say is suffering is not incompatible with this game of \"life proceeding to exist\" as you put it. There are things which benefit from creating suffering on others. Here's a rule right now on planet earth. This rule **really** and actually exists. If someone is looking at the simulation of earth right now, they could open up the rulebook that says \"How to progress as a conscious entity on Earth\":\n\n\"If you can make those who compete with you suffer without anyone realizing it, you are winning the game.\"\n\nIt's a very broad rule, but it's a rule right now on earth. If you follow this rule, you win in evolutionary terms. This is how evolution supports suffering in a sophisticated way, meant to describe human+ interaction but it can in theory apply to lower organisms too. A rule that tends to work well for lower organisms, but not so well as humans(Only up to recently, since much of human history is full of applying the rule of murdering competition) is, \"If you can kill your competition, you are winning the game.\"\n\nMuch of nature is still operating on this rule. Predators who can eat their prey, get to win, and their prey, gets to lose. The predators who get to beat all other predators, get to win the hardest. All of this functions because suffering exists. If suffering was impossible, then these predators would have to find other systems to win with - because it would still be about selection, since it's selection which emerges from 1) replication 2) variation 3) competition.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1554673775,"distinguished":null,"edited":1554674038,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ekcecke","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bajdit","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_bajdit","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bajdit\/i_cant_grasp_how_life_is_proceeding_to_exist\/ekcecke\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1557672031,"score":6,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Each country is trying to dominate each other, each culture, each religion, each gender is trying to gain domination over the other, and all of this overlaps. And which ever \"sphere\" has a bigger army of empathyless, manipulative, cunning \"soldiers\" who don't give themselves away as psychopaths too easily, beats the other \"tribe\".\n\nSo when 20 year old girls who are already in debt have children with physically abusive asshole men, it makes total sense from the perspective of any sort of drive to \"win the race\".

The children produced by such a couple would get eaten alive in a world full of psychopaths. These children would be deeply depressed unless their parents were absolute heroes of mental fortitude and could successfully instill that trait in their children. It's actually a disadvantage from the perspective of evolution to not be a psychopath. This is why women have this trend of reproducing with abusive assholes - it's not that the last century hasn't done enough work to say \"Hey ladies, when you let men like these impregnate you, then you and your future children get beaten since you know... you're fucking actual sociopaths\", it's actually hard wired to do so because survival comes first. You are not simply incentivized to fuck a psychopath, if you're a woman, you're incentivized to also metaphorically fuck up your child to *become* a psychopath, because it improves survival.

Certain hardships no longer exist, or are less frequent, but new hardships have emerged. Take the case with women, for example, who enjoy the greatest improvements to life in countless ways from 100 years ago. Teen girl suicides are up 75%, as opposed to 25% with boys. It turns out that since boys tend to bully each other physically, they mostly spend their time using the internet for games and porn. Teenage girls on the other hand are empowered by the internet to bully each other like never before, and they do this so viciously that almost twice as many girls kill themselves today than over a decade ago.  The internet, which didn't exist for our ancestors to reap the massive rewards from, also creates problems. \n\nLife has certainly gotten better in many ways, there's no denying that, but it's also gotten worse in a few ways, and combined with increased education and spread of information, it's now far easier to appreciate just how bad life is than it was 100 years ago. It's also easier to appreciate the ways in which it has improved - which are numerous too.\n\nAnother key difference is, the psychological pacifier of religion has taken very heavy blows in the last decades, where as 100 years ago, just about every single person was religious. Almost everyone could be assured that God was looking after them, this was a very powerful lie to believe in surviving a harsh life. While there are many people who are pathologically pessimistic, there are plenty of times where  now people are forced to deal with the maladaptive disposition of lucidity in regards to how bad life is - this has the opposite effect as believing God is looking after you - it makes for a profoundly bleak life unless you can figure out some sort of philosophical model for not resenting everything and everyone.

It's very hard to overcome this, paradoxically, especially when you have severe depression. The serotonin and dopamine required to execute something like suicide are often nowhere to be found. \n\nSecondly, due to the legal aspect, many methods are illegal - the risk of punishment massively complicates things for the suicidal.\n\nThirdly, being reasonably sure your method will succeed is another form of neurosis to add on the list. You can't exactly become skilled at suicide - failure can mean dramatically increased suffering, and if you're at a state where life has been such misery that you've already seriously considered dying, increased suffering can mean a hell unlike most people can imagine.\n\nSuicide is almost never *easy*, and it almost always requires **courage**.\n\nThat being said, to understand the taboo of suicide one must understand that like with all taboos, they exist because human hierarchies have incentives to strengthen themselves in any way possible. Why do these incentives exist? As the apex of a hierarchy, you are **competing** against other hierarchies, for resources, domination, survival, etc. \n\n Take the ancient taboo of homosexuality. If the men in your hierarchy wastes procreative energy not strengthening the hierarchy at which you sit atop of, this is bad for you, as a ruling class member. You are incentivized to create, say, a text which everyone obeys which stops your society from doing this. \n\nLikewise with suicide, if the lower rungs on the hierarchy find it too easy to off themselves when life gets too hard, this is bad for you, as the ruling class. Imagine you're playing a tough chess game and all of a sudden two pawns become animated, pull out handguns, profess this is too stressful, and destroy themselves. Whelp, now you've increased your odds of losing the game, and we can't have that.\n\nNow with our situation, it gets more complicated. Why do we force, say, severely ill people to stay alive, who are nothing but piss, shit, and pain factories, and not simply give them a lethal dose of morphine? First of all, thankfully, we **do**, much of the time in secret - because there are some sane and merciful people in the hospital industry. But in general, the status quo appears to be \"Life at all costs\". The reason again comes down to incentives - is the person worth more, in total, alive or dead? As long as there is a strong enough incentive, you will get some kind of ethical failing in a complex system. These people rack up bills by the boatload - if they're dead, there is no one to pay up, apart from funeral services, which is another predatory industry.\n\nAgain, with any massive societal injustice, looking at society on the ground will always lead to confusion and missing the big picture. If you want to understand any problem, look at the whole system and ask, \"Who benefits from this? What are the incentives?\"","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1555008415,"distinguished":null,"edited":1555010136,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eknhcpz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bbyurm","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_bbyurm","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bbyurm\/why_is_there_no_right_to_take_ones_own_life\/eknhcpz\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1558098762,"score":23,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

She was home-schooled at grade 2, because her mother convinced her that she was mentally handicapped. She forced her to take seizure medication, resulting in her teeth falling out. Then she had a feeding tube inserted. Then leukemia was added to list of fake illness.\n\nThis is just the extreme case.

If you interpret, for instance, the Catholic doctrine of the sinfulness of condom use, as simply a silly belief about souls and preventing God's will, then of course, it will seem completely ridiculous. However, if religion is merely an adaptation of a collective state to socially engineer it's populace and have survival benefits over other populaces, then it's painfully obvious what the purpose of the taboo of condom use is - greater populations mean more people for an exploiter to exploit.\n\nA surprisingly effective way to view the world is from the perspective of a farmer, running a large farm, and plug in concepts from humanity to see how they function. Suppose cows were conscious and decided they wanted to have a right to choose when they die. They could say, \"I believe life isn't worth living, and this life is **mine**, and only I can decide when I leave this place.\"\n\nWell, this would be a *massive* problem from the perspective of the farmer. The farmer would need to crack down on such behavior, either via taboos, propaganda, reduced freedoms for the cow, forced medication of the cow, etc.\n\nThe game is after all, about the milk. The farmer is incentivized to do everything they can to maximize milk output, and anything that seriously poses a problem for this, is a conflict of interests.\n\nHomosexuality is quite an ancient taboo, and the cultures which applied this taboo now mostly dominate the world. This isn't an accident, it's because cultures who exercised this taboo(expressed religiously, but originating from the ruling class), benefited from disincentivizing behavior that would 1) Weaken their millitary, which is not so big today, but was a huge thing historically. 2) Lower their population. Again, if your cows were engaging in homosexuality, this is a problem for the farmer, and it would be in their best interest to crack down.\n\nOf course, one can naively view the taboo of homosexuality as just some random mythology from an ancient text with no meaning or purpose, but then it's pervasiveness is utterly nonsensical. As an adaptation which benefits as society however, it makes immense sense.\n\nLikewise, with condoms, it would be ridiculous to look at a scenario where cows are *encouraged* to use condoms, and any serious condom use in cows would be cracked down on.\n\nWe don't quite live in a world where condoms are a black market product which carries the death penalty for using or selling, but the crucial thing to understand is incentives evolve and have to be strong enough. It could very well be that there's simply room for things to get worse, or that things are far worse than they appear and we are simply blinded by the dystopian nature of our reality by the mutual benefit for both cows and farmers, to give cows breathing room.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1555118902,"distinguished":null,"edited":1555121043,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":1},"id":"ekrmexd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bckv4i","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_ekrlbip","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bckv4i\/why_do_the_poor_and_stupid_breed_the_most\/ekrmexd\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1558168735,"score":62,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":1}

The veto is itself a \"marching order\", which is then interpreted as free choice by the ego.\n\nThe most fascinating aspect of this article to me, is the language used. A \"Defense\" of Free Will. The \"fear\" that we're just robots. I think this really illuminates the debate. There's something about determinism that leaves a very bad, bitter taste in many people's mouths. \"So you're saying I'm just a robot?\" \"**ME?!**\"\n\nThis sort of reaction is just dripping with the ego, taking offense, and stomping away refusing to accept such a claim. This is the core problem, and I'm thrilled to see a reference to Jonathan Haidt's content here because I think a psychological analysis of Free Will vs. Determinism, and *not* a philosophical analysis, will resolve it. The philosophy is done to death. The rest of the problem is purely emotional and psychological, purely a matter of the ego refusing to unplug it's ears. My pet hunch is that it's *personality* traits which determine(heh) a rejection or acceptance of determinism.

The winning strategy for the longest time is to groom a culture of psychopaths from birth. Tough as nails, with no empathy, callous, manipulative, but yet charming and socially adept.

It's not that the world has only recently been a shit place - this force has been a player in natural selection for a very long time, so there are probably a countless lineage of depressed souls who died childless and alone or even killed themselves, because they saw how brutal the world was - everyone who didn't instead made babies, and here we are.\n\nThe right move is still pretty unclear.

Either you believe unfairness is a good thing, or a bad thing. You give an example of a menial laborer earning less than say, a highly skilled profession. But *this* isn't unfair, right? This is simply fairness. What could be unfair about this, however, is the fact that the plumber couldn't have meaningfully become a neuroscientist, because we live in a deterministic universe where choices are illusory.

Yes, but they would require the most extreme luck, with such stacked odds.\n\nFree will is a religious fantasy that is totally at odds with our understanding of the brain, human psychology, and the way the universe works.

What standards for human decency should we use? Who decides what is decent? Is it decent that wealthy people have access to expensive life saving surgical procedures? How does this evolve with time? This fairly arbitrary, so wouldn't it just make more sense to try to make the world with as much opportunity equality as humanly possible?\n\n&gt;\"Bad\", in my opinion, evokes an emotional response and an action that resolves the underlying cause. I usually keep \"bad\" separate from \"neutral\" to understand what things can be solved or not. Nothing to do with fairness. Yet, I don't tend to think of things as dichotomies (good vs bad). There's more to things than just my emotional response.\n\n\u200bIt's true that there are gradients to good\/bad, and there are things which are simply benign. But there's nothing intrinsic to \"bad\" that has anything at all to do with emotion. \"Raping children is bad\" can be said in a totally unemotional context, purely with an understanding that living a world where raping children is *not* bad, is detrimental to every living thing as a whole. You could have zero empathy and zero emotions and make the claim that raping children is bad. Likewise with the phrase \"Inequality of opportunity is bad\". These are both uncontroversial statements ethically. You don't want to live in a world that is deeply unfair, and you don't want to live in a world where children get raped. Not complicated.\n\n&gt;I agree that one cannot argue that all stories of success are purely human drive. Luck or \"destiny\" plays a part, indeed. Some life events are outside our control, of course. But to say that we're stuck to our destinies only helps you feel void of drive and willpower. It only breeds nihilism and resentment. After all, why would you put an effort in anything you do if you're destined to be who you will be?\n\nTo ask why one doesn't just sit on a couch and do nothing if everything is determined, is a conflation of fatalism with determinism. This isn't  the easiest concept to understand, given that if one does happen to sit on the couch until the end of time, that is indeed determined. This part throws people for a loop, but they're a subtle distinction. You still have to try, because otherwise, you're just determining nothing, in simpler language.\n\nAs for resentment, it's actually the religiously inspired notion of Free Will that is the mother of all resentment. If you believe people can meaningfully choose their behavior and thoughts, or do otherwise than they did, well then, this opens the door to calling people lazy fucks or assholes who really deserve it. It opens the door to punishment. It opens the door to revenge. It opens the door to pride(What's so bad about pride? Nothing, other than the fact that it's nonsensical, since no one meaningfully earned anything. Should we still reward people? Sure, why not. We should re-enforce positive behavior. But masturbation about one's achievements and ego stroking goes out the window with determinism, and good fucking riddance.)\n\nNihilism, again I just see this as a total non sequitur. Questions of meaning are not dependent on the idea that physics is a very specific set of billiard balls bouncing neurons into neurons within brains, bouncing sperm into eggs within people, and bouncing people into people within planets, which bounce neurons into brains, etc. This obsession of only having meaning if you can say \"I **earned** it!\" or \"You **deserved** it!\" are merely the products of determinism being the single most egodystonic concept in our universe.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1555310288,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ekxbfxx","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bda72k","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ekx9hu6","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/bda72k\/equality_of_opportunity_sometimes_means_equality\/ekxbfxx\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1558454355,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Much like with the concept of a lie of omission, if say, you see a parent and child walking towards a puddle on the street that happens to be live with electrical current, and say nothing because, after all, it's not your job, and watch them suffer the consequences, then this is the behavior of a psychopath.

Likewise, a small number of people who those with pickaxes and looters beam on board, appear uninterested with this unsavory behavior. Instead they either do nothing, drown themselves, or sometimes patch the hull or help pump water - but this exercise can seem futile. We certainly don't want the people with the pickaxes, or people looting to gain numbers for their cause, but they're precisely the people who will continue to beam people on board to help loot the ship, break the hull and murder the passengers. What is the right thing to do? Jump off? Beam people on board if you're an engineer? \n\nThe core issue with Antinatalism is that it's the *engineers* who are refusing to do the beaming , and then eventually jumping off, which causes a greater and greater disproportion of looters to engineers.

Innocence is not a particularly beneficial adaptation from the perspective of natural selection. It could have mild benefit in human society, speaking broadly. An innocent child poses no risk to others, and this non-threatening nature does have some mild benefit - but the con here is that from the perspective of the bearer of innocence, this person is doomed in a world full of psychopathy.\n\nSo the least innocent, or to be more specific, the most psychopathic traits, are the ones with the highest survival chance. Innocence is compatible with psychopathy, of course, so perhaps that's the true purpose of innocence - to serve as a mask.\n\nAs for \"bullshit morals\", you've experienced two things in life. 1) The world is full of psychopathy. 2) You are no different from all the other apes wearing clothes, in that, you too possess these traits.\n\nThis is the outcome of being an offspring of a long string of survivors. Essentially, everyone alive today is a psychopath to some degree. They are selfish, egotistical, deceptive, and so on. These traits were selected over countless generations, for many millions of years.\n\nWere there kind apes, who were not psychopathic, but instead brimming with a high degree of empathy, cooperation, selfless behavior, ethical traits which would put modern humans to shame? Almost certainly, but these animals and people(the line is blurred here), were simply dominated by the ones who survived - us. And we are the current living ancestors of the monsters which raped, killed, and ate all the nicer animals, including members of our own species.\n\nBut none of this means that morals are bullshit, it only means that we are selfish robots programmed by many millions of years of evolution to not appreciate morals in a very sophisticated way.

When he would be taken care of by his Grandmother, posing as his mother, the fact of the monster of his grandfather would be resonating into her, too. All one needs to imagine if the sort of woman she would be, if she were instead married to a kind, loving, ethical man - what a change that would create. So this is what he had as an example for a father figure. The lie of his birth was orchestrated in such a sinister way, where he was the last one to be \"in on the joke\", that he eventually found out from a cousin who showed him his birth certificate and called him a bastard. So here he was, bullied, abused by parents who were not his, forced to ask \"Why did my real mother abandon me? Did she not love me enough...?\"\n\nAnd so a monster was born, this is just one snippet in a chain of causality, involving genetics, hellish life, various happenstance, etc.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1555705432,"distinguished":null,"edited":1555705796,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"elandsq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_beu0mv","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_el9hg25","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/beu0mv\/shit_like_this_are_you_fucking_kidding_me\/elandsq\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1558736954,"score":8,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Narcissism, along with Psychopathy is heavily favored in nature for getting from point A(a biological entity) to point B(the offspring of biological entity). If your eyes are glazing over right now, don't worry. We can really simplify this idea. Think of the absolute \"Anti-Narcissist\" you can imagine. Imagine a cartoon, where two genes are trying to enter a door, and one says to the other, \"No please, after you. I insist, my interests here aren't important. I just want YOU to achieve your goals instead.\"\n\nThis is .... nice and ethical , but it's a bad strategy from the gene's eye view. Imagine another cartoon, where it's two genes again, trying to enter the same door. One gene pulls out a machete and butchers the other gene, eats it for sustenance, lets out a howl, and enters the door. \n\n\nNow we're talking nature. This is just one of the many \"favored\" games of nature, brutality. There are other \"strategies\" that work. Being self absorbed and entitled is great(for genes). One gene PUSHING the other out of the way, and strutting through the door. Remind you of anyone's mindset?\n\nAnother strategy is manipulation. One gene says to the other, \"Hey, actually the better door is around the corner.\" followed by a superficial, charming, and irresistible smile. The gene which was tricked, walks around corner, enters a dark alley, and gets murdered by lunatics waiting in the shadows.\n\n Another strategy is not *feeling* bad about doing all of the above. A gene whose heart bleeds with regret for doing horrible things is at a **disadvantage**, so  that goes out the window too.\n\n\nSlowly and slowly, we're seeing how the psychopathic and narcissistic model gains it's dominance. But of course, there's still plenty of room for genes running on other strategies. These are the things which make us human, and played a part in our ability to cooperate with each other as a species. But unfortunately, it's not \"Let the nicest strategy win\", in nature. It's \"Let the **best** strategy, regardless of ethics, win.\" The cruelty of nature makes complete sense under such a model, as does the cruelty of child abuse. It's in the genetic interests of a narcissist and psychopath , to groom their children into narcissists and psychopaths, because that works as far as surviving, at the cost of ruining everyone's lives, including robbing the child in question of ever meaningfully experiencing what it means to feel human - to love another person with all your heart, the satisfaction of helping someone not because YOU benefit from it, but because it's the right thing to do, the security of knowing you have a family who genuinely cares for you and isn't merely keeping up appearances - these are all things which the \"narcissist\" and \"psychopath\" genetic strategy robs from us as human beings. But if you're on this forum, chances are the strategy has thankfully failed on you, but not without some scarring and mild infection(Fleas). All we can do is try to be more human, and less like robots who ruin the lives of others just because it's an expedient survival strategy.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1555717715,"distinguished":null,"edited":1555717984,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"elb3uw8","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bf2cmt","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_bf2cmt","permalink":"\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/bf2cmt\/why_do_narcissists_always_enjoy_making_other\/elb3uw8\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1558744693,"score":6,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

If you fight this idea of determinism by saying \"I will *not* act in a way that is determined\", you are acting precisely in the way in which you've been determined.

If you're the last living sentient thing, on the last deathbed, in a cold reality that will remain cold(No life, no sentience) for the remainder of infinity, simply the death of this person is irrelevant, because they're the last thing to which ethics can matter.\n\nHowever, if you're in a society of sentient things, the fact that you're dead may not matter to you, but it matters to sentient things living in a society that believes death is intrinsically good *because* things can't matter to dead sentience.\n\nThis is the same principle at work in the ethical dilemma where a there are 5 people in a hospital, each needing a different organ(Lungs, kidney, liver, etc). A perfectly healthy individual sits in the waiting room, and can be quickly drugged, Dexter style, and have their organs harvested to save 5 people. Is it wrong to kill this person to save 5 people? Well, there's no harm to the person being killed, since they're dead(Epicurean position on death), and there's even so much good that comes from it. The person had zero living family, and happened to be a friendless and unemployed farmer living off their own tiny bit of land. Society isn't \"missing\" them in any real way.\n\nBut the ethical dilemma here isn't even in the good the organs do, or the suffering-free death. The ethical dilemma is in the **world** in which people can be swept up and have their organs harvested. Likewise with the Epicurean position, this isn't the most ethical world to live in. You want a world that has a flexible position on death - death is good when it is generally consented to, generally prevents net suffering and\/or  generally causes net good. This is a very flexible concept\/perspectivally complicated, because it's hard to say for example if the death of a criminal holding a hostage at gunpoint is \"good\" itself, that doesn't make a ton of sense.

We form cliques and tribes so we can hear others tell us how correct we are and how wrong the opposing people are. We didn't really evolve the tools to seamlessly update our misconceptions about reality, because creatures which did this had a tendency of dying or not mating. So instead we're left with this world of beings that function on very rigid operating systems.

If everyone in power A have as many kids as possible, but power B and C only let their top 75% most successful people have kids, power A will lose the game. To win the game involves having a perfect strategy here, and if power A tries to have an ethical plan, while powers B and C ignore ethics and just cheat ethically as much as possible, so long as it gives an advantage in the game, power A will lose the game. \n\n\nSo in the case of disabled people being forced to be born and suffer, power A understands that having 50 million disabled people is a **tremendous** economic gain over a lifetime, and having the strongest economy you can makes you able to spend money on infrastructure, defense, offense, research, education, etc. The option is between losing to power B and C, or joining B and C to be monsters.

Once you disallow the disabled, the next rung of the hierarchy is the target, and so on.

The world has always been a cruel, manipulative, and insanely competitive place. That has not changed much since our parents were children, only become clearer in certain senses, and more obfuscated in others.\n\nWhile the quote is true in the very obvious way, in the sense that some culturally revolutionary things occur here and there, the essence of the world is still the same - cruel, manipulative, and insanely competitive.\n\nThe saddest bit of all of this is, is that what we think of \"bad parenting\" is actually good, from the perspective of evolution. I know, you're horrified. I am too, and always will be. I am in no way condoning abuse of **any** kind. And that's what will keep us human. But if you watch a nature documentary, you'll see that nature isn't some Disneyfied paradise, it's terrifying, brutal, and filled with lots and lots of pain. It's a constantly perpetuating struggle for survival. That which is strongest and most fortunate, gets selected mindlessly.\n\nAnd we're just as much a part of it, and this is where our abusers tie into all of this. Subjecting children to extreme abuse is cold, heartless, psychopathic, indifferent-to-right\/wrong-Nature's way of saying \"This improves survival\". Take the extreme opposite example. Imagine a child that is coddled to an extreme - never allowed to take risks. Never allowed to get hurt. Always protected. Such a child won't \"Survive\" in an evolutionary sense. They may be alive, but in an *evolutionary* sense which means \"being a go-getter and attacking life, gaining financial independence and being the talk of town with potential life mates\" - this won't happen. However, there's a bias here - because a subset of abused children will either become charming manipulative domineering psychopaths(This is a \"Free win\" from cold hearted evolution's perspective, but despicable from the view of us in \"Humanville\"), or they will simply be highly resistant to abuse, lack empathy and therefore resist manipulation, or broken as the coddled group of children are broken.\n\nThe thing to understand is these are not just two equally viable strategies from the point of view of evolution. The offspring with \"tough parents\" will have an advantage over the offspring of \"kind parents\", all else equal, and the rest is history. There's an unfair genetic advantage for being cruel to children, from the point of view of this unconscious natural process. It's disgusting, and has to be opposed, but this is the reality we live in. The problem is in fact, that our parents **did** raise us for precisely this cold, cruel, manipulative and competitive world -- that's what's even more heartbreaking about all of this. This explanation gives me far more relief as an abuse victim, rather than simply seeing my abuser as an evil monster, because a lot of resentment and rumination melt away - which can sometimes be worse than the abuse itself because it can haunt one for life.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1556077408,"distinguished":null,"edited":1556077997,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"elmp4h4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bgfb44","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_bgfb44","permalink":"\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/bgfb44\/you_cannot_raise_your_children_how_your_parents\/elmp4h4\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1559038982,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

This is the question you must ask yourself to learn what kind of people they really are.\n\nI would personally err on the side of full NC, but besides that, I just want to remind you some helpful insights about abuse. The first thing is to never forget the acronym, DARVO.\n\nIt stands for: Deny, Attack, and Reverse the Victim and Offender.\n\nIt applies to ALL toxic forms of abusive interaction - not only sexual abuse. Narcissists, Psychopaths, and anyone who has some kind of antisocial condition will use this style of interacting with an abuse victim. Lastly, I want to raise your awareness of how it *feels* on a human level to have DARVO used on you by abusive people so you can better detect it in your future encounters with your family or anyone. Have you ever seen a magic trick using slight of hand, like when a performer makes a coin disappear in their hand, but they really just snuck it using some sneaky moves where your eyes were distracted with some other thing(Planned by the performer) to make the trick work?\n\nThis feeling of confusion is how it feels to have DARVO used on you. First you may object to something or bring up something abusive that happened to you. \"Hey, you know one time, dad this to me &lt;...&gt;\". Immediately, it gets denied. This could be *very* subtle. Very **sneaky**. You need to look carefully to see it, or you won't see it - just like the magic trick with the coin. Then, you, the victim, are instead attacked. Again, this doesn't mean they will attack you physically. This doesn't even mean they will show any anger! It *just* means, you now have this feeling inside you that says, \"Wait... what? Now I need to defend *myself*?\" Like this: \"Excuse me! Police officer, that person stole my belonging!\" and the Police officer says, \"No he didn't. Are you sure?\" -&gt; \"Maybe you were doing something wrong to make him think that was *his* belonging...?\" -&gt; You feel crazy at this moment, like you must defend yourself. This is DARVO.\n\nAgain, the whole feeling should make you feel something is wrong. Or something is confusing, or doesn't make sense. This is what DARVO feels like until you know the \"magic trick\". When you know the trick, it will be easy to see. But for now, I just wish to raise your awareness to you know what to look for.

The scope for 'progress' and 'wellbeing' that Pinker uses could really use widening. Still, it's a lot of data that can't be ignored.

You wouldn't even need to put an effort into an analysis, these facts would hit you daily. I suspect it was far more similar to what it feels like living in North Korea today.\n\nGiven how prevalent torture, contradiction, unfairness, and suffering were at the time, these are all things which even non-humans have intuitions against, so I think it's very safe to conclude that life was net worse.\n\nI think one thing someone could point out to Pinker however, is that he completely ignores a kind of modern intellectual torture that occurs, simply by living in a system like ours in the 21st century. All of this progress comes at a modern price, where the modern day peasant experiences hard-to-imagine discontent. I don't have a good way of describing this, but the way to trigger this intuition I guess would be...\n\nImagine if we could install security protected television screens in the places on Earth where life was hardest today, doing nothing but showing images of the top 1% having the time of their lives.

I think the distinction(a pri\/a pos) causes more confusion about philosophical questions than it relieves. My view is written in response to the other person who joined the conversation, but basically I'm uninterested in any sort of pragmatic approach to knowledge. One can take Kant's physician of the 1700's to express what I mean:\n\nA physician can study all of their lives, but a core feature of learning is pragmatic since we're mere apes who need to exercise their cerebrum to apply our understanding and refine it. However, this is a hamfisted approach to truth. It's only a pragmatic approach to being as decent of a physician in the 1700's as one can be. The physician is bottlenecked by the sum of medical knowledge that exists in the year 1700. They are also bottlenecked by the sum of medical activity one can perform as a man living in 1700. Which of the two is the most meaningful path to truth? Here's the kicker...\n\n**I do not care.**\n\nI'm not interested in this kind of pragmatic question. This isn't how philosophical pay dirt is attained, in my view. No matter what one does here, they are doomed to be either 1) The most knowledgeable physician in the year 1700, or the most practiced physician in the year 1700, probably not both, but maybe? Either way, who cares? This isn't valuable. The further stimulate this intuition, imagine an Egyptian physician in Pharaonic times in the same dilemma. Striking the same balance. Too much study? Can't apply theory, can't transcend to newer heights. Too much \"Just do it, Nike(tm)\"? No theory, too much work. Chaos, failure.\n\nBut when balanced juuuuust right...\n\nWait, who cares again?\n\nMy conclusion: For philosophical problems to be meaningfully answered and tackled, one must first start with the following problem: We are apes smeared across a chunk of spacetime. Pragmatism in your spacetime slice is not as useful as it appears. Practicing the art of Gorfeulblorp may make you better at Gorfeulblorp, but... that's just not very interesting. You're more likely to realize Gorfeulblorp is bullshit if you sit around all day thinking about Gorfeulblorp, rather than trying to get better and better at Gorfeulblorp. Kant tried to tackle philosophy in a pragmatic, and rigid way, and ended up with what looks more like Categorical Spaghetti code.

If something possessing DNA cares about another thing or DNA carrier that isn't itself, it's in the context of it's own selfishness. I'm not sure if transcending this is possible, perhaps it is, but that isn't important for the purpose of answering the question, because overwhelmingly, the world is full of these automata.\n\nThese automata, or lifebots, are constrained by whatever drives they have, and how these drives manifest in their brains, and also get tumbled between the brains of other DNA carriers. The ability to reflect on these drives, or be taught some drives are good or bad, is itself part of the bigger constraint for human beings specifically(as far as we know).\n\nWith simpler neuroanatomy, you have simpler drives. Eat. Reproduce.(apart from single cell organisms, few multicellular organisms don't have neuroanatomy, but that isn't important here)\n\nAs we get more complex, you begin to see \"Avoid Pain\".\n\nWhen you get to more complex neuroanatomy, you start to see clear rewards for dominating everything around you. Social aspects emerge, like with insects. \n\nWhen you get to higher mammals, it becomes very clear - Dominate dominate dominate. Eat. Fuck. Eat. Fuck. Develop little tricks to achieve these things. Perhaps now you're paradoxically seeking pain, within reason, because it allows you to eat more or fuck more - so you can totally modify little rules as long as they improve the prime directives of eat-&gt;fuck. Perhaps now you're *abusing* your own children as your DNA carriers, rather than nurture them, because this is a viable evolutionary strategy for creating less sensitive creatures, who have improved domination ability or resistance to domination, with whatever coping strategy they've developed.\n\n At the highest form, us Humans, reality is **littered** with \"tricks\". Where previously, being an overt bully could be a big advantage, now, it's not good enough. Now you need to be a bully deep down inside, but with a gorgeous charming smile outside. The perfection of domination is a trick, because it's making domination into an art, rather than an impulse. A woman manipulating her environment to ruin another woman's reputation and having her friends turn on her, and making her lesser than herself, in social terms, is no different in essence from a man taking a banana, frying it in butter, sugar, and rum, and pouring the remaining sauce over vanilla ice cream. Both are \"tricks\" which achieve evolutionary goals. The first trick dominates social structure, the second trick is a food trick. Food tricks, and Domination tricks, satisfy the directive in multiple ways which feedback into each other. Domination satisfies domination itself, but domination also satisfies the \"Fuck\" directive - as you dominate more, you fuck more. Likewise, making Bananas Foster a la mode, satisfies the directive of Eat, but also satisfies the directive of Fuck, because now you've created a little trick which can entice other lifebots. This is how these two things, which seem totally unrelated, essentially come from the same set of basic drives. It's worth noting that, lower creatures cannot do this to any real degree that humans can. \n\nNow for some real tricks. Lying. Manipulation of others with high skill and low effort. Feeling no empathy, which is strange for fairly empathetic apes to do, but it's a great trick in the right context. And as previously mentioned, the artform, sport, and science of dominating other human beings. This set of all of aforementioned tricks is called psychopathy. It also distills selfishness and egomania in a way that few other trick-sets do, so it addresses OP's title question. \n\nNow that I've answered the question, It's worth diving a little into Psychopathy, because why not. When people think psychopath, they immediately think of Ted Bundy or someone like him. A murderer. But this is not a good representation of a psychopath, because he is not camouflaged. He was caught by the system, working alone, and was exposed. Psychopathy is best understood as a kind of social camouflage, where your true intentions are deeply hidden, and you manipulate those around you with great skill, yet have the same callous nature as Ted Bundy. What people tend not to understand is, it can work in an effectively perfect way. Perfect in the sense, that all of our leaders could be psychopaths today, and no effective number of people could realize this with the ability to do something about it, and those that tried, would be seen as insane. Everyone at the top of every powerful institution is *probably* a psychopath. That could simply be what it takes to get there. Being a top CEO? Psychopath. Leader of a first world intelligence agency? Psychopath. Within this little sphere of power, they compete amongst each other. Imagine how a non-psychopath would function in such a world. Imagine a guy just showing up, who is not at all like a psychopath. Think of it like stats, in an RPG. Instead of Strength, Dexterity, etc. You have Manipulation, Lack of Empathy, Charm, Domineering, Egomania, etc. Imagine someone with these stats maxed out more than anyone. This is the psychopath. Sounds terrible, but again, people completely forget that it comes **with a smile**, and with virtue, and prestige. Now imagine someone competing with this person, for their position, who simply didn't have these traits. Maybe they even had some very virtuous traits, like honesty, empathy, fairness, selflessness, etc. This person would get **devoured**. This is because psychopathy is, de facto, the ultimate toolkit for ruling the planet. Hopefully that should cover why it is rational to suspect that psychopaths rule the world.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1556252100,"distinguished":null,"edited":1556254853,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"elt33ie","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bh5xhy","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_bh5xhy","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bh5xhy\/why_are_people_so_innately_selfish\/elt33ie\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1559147315,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I shall attempt to rebutt the rebuttal here. I've not read this specific writing(I haven't even gotten far into Pinker's latest book), and I'm certainly not his lawyer so I'm not sure how differently he'd respond, but I'm familiar with a lot of these arguments as they tend to reappear in the Pro-science genre.\n\n&gt;Opposing reason is, by definition, unreasonable.\u201d Steven Pinker is fond of definitions. Early on in this monumental apologia for a currently fashionable version of Enlightenment thinking, he writes: \u201cTo take something on faith means to believe it without good reason, so by definition a faith in the existence of supernatural entities clashes with reason.\u201d Well, it\u2019s good to have that settled once and for all. There is no need to trouble yourself with the arguments of historians, anthropologists and evolutionary biologists, who treat religion as a highly complex phenomenon, serving a variety of human needs. All you need do is consult a dictionary, and you will find that religion is \u2013 by definition \u2013 irrational.\n\nThe utility and power of religion is perfectly compatible with science, and I don't think that's the argument Pinker or others like him are making. Much like the utility and power of the Placebo effect is perfectly compatible with science, but we wouldn't want a world structured on the placebo effect as a remedy, we also wouldn't want a world structured on religion as a way to interpret reality. They are analogous in this regard, as far as science is concerned. Yet, at the same time, it feels strange to many people who feel bogged down by the question, \"But how can science *tell* us that we shouldn't structure our entire medical approach on the placebo effect?\" More on that shortly.\n\n&gt;Yet in A Treatise of Human Nature (1738), Hume wrote: \u201cReason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.\u201d Hume believed being reasonable meant accepting the limits of reason, and so too, in quite different ways, did later Enlightenment rationalists such as Keynes and Freud. Pinker\u2019s Enlightenment has little in common with the much more interesting intellectual movement that historically existed.\n\nI skipped the previous paragraph, because it didn't argue for much of anything. But here we see one of the confusions of Hume - he got it half right. Reason **is** a slave of the passions, in that, everyone is at the mercy of a slew of biases, one of which is that they can only perceive and interpret the world however they happen to perceive and interpret it. Donald Trump is *doomed* to be Donald Trump , and a quadriplegic in the slums of Mumbai, is just as doomed. But the half that Hume got wrong is, the passions are also a slave to Reason. The moment sufficient reasons are presented, and we compelled by them, our passions can simply dissolve(albeit with great discomfort) to reason. We know this can happen. Everyone has to had accept a harsh truth at some point in their lives. Where were the passions there? The passion there, was reason itself. Making sense, being in touch with reality, and having logical consistency are **themselves** kinds of passions.\n\nThe following few paragraphs basically contain Hume's Is-Ought argument and examples of how people extrapolating meaning from science were wrong, so I'll cover that too. To function at all, we need Ought's. Some good oughts are: \"We shouldn't manufacture a hellscape for every possible thing that can suffer.\" and \"We should value reason, openness to evidence, consideration for the shortcomings of the human brain\". Without oughts, we cannot even have this conversation. The ought that we should make sense, be coherent, convince others and be open to convincing, is taken for granted with every conversation. So Hume himself confuses the problem, and doesn't recognize how Ought-heavy consciousness is in the first place. Not only can you get Oughts from Is's, you are functioning on a slew of Oughts for no apparent reason, other than you need to pull yourself up by your bootstraps as a conscious entity - philosophers love to ignore this idea, and love how profound and infallible arguing against it is, and then they turn around and dismiss Solipsism, the most famous Ought-impoverished philosophical position in human history. It's a pity Hume fell into this trap himself.\n\n&gt;The Victorian prophet of social evolution, Herbert Spencer, believed that the universe, life and society were moving from undifferentiated simplicity to a higher state of complex order. In politics, this meant a movement towards laissez-faire capitalism. In social contexts, \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d \u2013 an expression Spencer invented after reading Darwin\u2019s On the Origin of Species \u2013 meant that anyone unable to stay afloat in such a society would struggle, sink and then disappear. Spencer welcomed this process, since for him it was evolution in action \u2013 the movement from lower to higher forms of life.\n\nBad oughts from is's is simply not an argument that you cannot get meaningful values from scientific data. It just means you can apes with bad ought processing, nothing new here. The same argument goes for any Anti-science criticism involving \"horrors of the 20th century\".\n\n&gt;To be sure, for Pinker there are no bad Enlightenment ideas. One of the features of the comic-book history of the Enlightenment he presents is that it is innocent of all evil. Accordingly, when despots such as Lenin repeatedly asserted that they engaged in mass killing in order to realise an Enlightenment project \u2013 in Lenin\u2019s case, a more far-reaching version of the Jacobin project of re-educating society by the methodical use of terror \u2013 they must have been deluded or lying. How could a philosophy of reason possibly be implicated in murderous totalitarianism? Like the faithful who tell you Christianity is \u201ca religion of love\u201d that had nothing to do with the Inquisition, Pinker stipulates that the Enlightenment, by definition, is intrinsically liberal. Modern tyrannies must therefore be products of counter-Enlightenment ideologies \u2013 Romanticism, nationalism and the like. Enabling liberals to avoid asking difficult questions about why their values are in retreat, this is a popular view. Assessed in terms of historical evidence, it is also a myth.\n\nThis is simply a straw man. First of all, what is the author even calling a bad Enlightenment idea? The idea that Mass killing is okay? Because that's a first for me. Is this author against a commitment to reason? skepticism? Anyway, if any Enlightenment idea was confused, it was probably Individualism. But the antidote to this is not to abandon reason or skepticism or science, it's do those things better. We now understand the causal nature of the universe in better ways to declare individualism as hogwash - we couldn't do this in a truly decisive way without science itself.\n\nThe analogy to Christianity is a false analogy, because Christianity is explicitly convoluted, contradictory, and superstitious garbage. Science is a commitment to reason, logic, evidence, and describing the world accurately. One would struggle to get less convoluted than that. It's quite a dishonest maneuver to say 20th century despots were \"practicing science\"(If anything they were practicing something very much like **religion**), but it's not so dishonest to say the crusades or the inquisition were not practicing Christianity - the text constantly endorses human sacrifice to the will of an invisible being.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1556329904,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"elvtwi3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bglczz","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eltr9dr","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bglczz\/humanity_progress\/elvtwi3\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1559194493,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

When you see your mom more like... a grizzly bear... or a tornado..., things which reliably destroy human beings when they come in contact with them, not because they're \"Evil\", but because that's the \"program\" they are running on, this perspective can be liberating.\n\nIt doesn't make what they did okay. You lose absolutely nothing as a victim of their unfortunate collision with your life. But you trade the hatred for an understanding that this wasn't a calculated act of evil, just simple misfortune that can be explained by psychology and neuroscience. Personally, it's a weight off of my shoulders. Resenting someone all of your life is a huge psychological drain - it haunts you well after the abuse is over. The view that people are the products of forces they ultimately can't control empowers you against abuse.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1556375210,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"elwv8kq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bhxz7a","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_bhxz7a","permalink":"\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/bhxz7a\/struggling_to_resolve_pain\/elwv8kq\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1559211993,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

These are just some thoughts while casually listening:\n\n1) The 'depression' argument. I first read the story Sam tells about the suicidal person when his book on ethics was published, and it remained the be the single weakest concept I've ever heard him express after over 10 years of very diligently following his work. It's a weak philosophical argument for a very simple reason - one can just as easily make the \"depression\" argument from within a dystopian hell like North Korea. I like how Benatar mentions mania, but I wish he could have expressed the problem of biases like wishful thinking, sunk costs, and particularly optimism bias, our evolutionary penchant for it, among countless others, more clearly\/strongly. Edit: He did bring up some of these issues a little later on.\n\n2) The asymmetry argument segment. I know the asymmetry argument is the most highly criticized part of Benatar's argument. I had to relisten to this, specifically 23:26, and I think the asymmetry argument takes about as hard of a beating as it can here. If a deprivation of bad is good, a deprivation of good is bad, unless our brains are poorly equipped to deal with this problem. Regardless, this sort of argument I feel isn't even good for AN. If anything, opponents of AN should be arguing about the potential of life, and AN should stick to the reality of suffering, risk and consent(which aren't perfect but are good enough).\n\n3) During this \"Blackjack Analogy\" segment, the argument gets a little harder for me to follow. This doesn't surprise me, because this is essentially one of the most important human questions of all time. It's interesting seeing Sam Harris sanitize human suffering in the way he does, to attempt to frame life as a clear \"Win\". I can sympathize with that effort, but it also seems a little tricky. He does about the best job one can in attempting to clearly get some kind of moral truth here. The consequentialism shows itself here when he disagrees that there's a difference between being worth coming into existence, vs. a life worth living. There's a perspectival disagreement here between Sam and David, because Sam is taking a 'God's eye view here' where all of spacetime is laid out before you, and where lives worth living are by definition lives worth having come into existence, while David is taking a very specific 'Subjective' sort of view here, where one is assessing circumstance and risk. Unfortunately, David avoids granting the consequentialism here and instead drops the 52\/48 analogy in favor of modern life today. I really do like how he expresses the indifference between heaven and nonexistence - I think there's a bias here from beings who would like to be in heaven(And happen to be in hell on earth) to not understand how as far as the act of creation goes, there is no ego for the think being created to care. You cannot really make the same argument coherently in the opposite direction, as in, there is no \"Bias to avoid hell\"(You can try, but it doesn't make any kind of philosophically principled sense from any position worth respecting). Benatar is pretty strong here, but Sam's pushback is about as good as it gets I suppose. I think the problem is basically again just perspectival here and not a real ethical disagreement. They go on about this problem for a huge chunk of the episode. \n\n4) The big red button argument. Another huge chunk. Unfortunately, this part of the discussion is a bit impoverished. It's taboo to seriously argue for the big red button, so I believe it's possible that David has taken a strategic position to avoid this philosophical stance because he understands this taboo. I could be completely wrong here, but this is my reading of the situation. I think anyone who views life on Earth as a \"Kind of North Korea\", knows this problem. It's possible that pushing the big red button is a wrong move, of course. And it's not hard to argue against it. The big red button is wrong if there is some unimaginable harm that *won't* be prevented, if such a button was pressed right now - but it is not necessarily wrong if there is some unimaginable good. I'm surprised Sam takes a position that essentially says 'If no one knows, it can't be bad', because I had always thought his ethics were grounded in an objective sense. I'm sure they still are, but I could easily come up with a bigger picture scenario where no **human** knows they've died to the big red button, but it happens that some evil misanthropic alien has pushed said button. In an objective moral sense, this is an evil(if we frame humanity positively) a good(in which case, the alien would not be evil, and would be a hero). The lack of suffering\/experience is irrelevant here. Pardon the fact that I'm writing all of this in real time, but I think this is just a confusion on my part, because Sam is very obviously concerned with consciousness. So when he says, \"It's not bad if no one would know\" he literally means **no one**. If everything that can experience, suddenly stops, and the lights go out in all realities, then that's 'not bad', according to Sam. I agree. This becomes clear when he mentions AI and says it would be bad if we created an AI hell by accident.\n\nThe non existence vs. the best possible experience is really tough to digest - I don't think ape brains are particularly well equipped for this problem. I'm going to continually try to re-evaluate this problem myself.\n\n5) The strongest pro-AN moment in the conversation for me.[1:27:33](https:\/\/youtu.be\/KYOQ5XMsbIk?t=5253) is where I feel Benatar is the strongest in this discussion, when he asks Sam if he'd subject his own children including several other generations for some greater good. Consequentialist\/Utilitarian ethics is incidentally *another* area where ape brains process the problem poorly. On one hand, you have the very Aspergersian(and what I'd ante up on, covertly psychopathic) body-count\/suffering vs. wellbeing tallying, on the other you have more objective and down-to-earth ethical examinations that imposing Hell on people just *isn't* worth something which need not happen, when the alternative is simply **refusing** to play the game of sentience-manufacture. And Sam Harris is very sensitive to this problem so he answers David very honestly here. Sam Harris is pretty out of touch with Capitalistic suffering, which is unfortunate, but understandable. He lives one of the richest lives possible on the planet, and the psychological baggage of this position is worth pitying, because he is robbed of the reality of the horror of suffering on earth as a result of mindless systems which are perfectly possible to cease. This is ultimately the human problem, a small group of very powerful and happy people benefit from a world of **immense** and unimaginable suffering, with software that robs them of the ability to have a truly humanist perspective of the state of the world. The issue with the Omelas problem isn't the obvious answer of walking away. The issue with Omelas is in the human brain -- that it is poorly suited, bias-filled , egotistic, self serving psychological state, which ultimately dooms most people to grasp the problem of Omelas. \n\n6) The experience machine\/Repugnant conclusion segment. I have to admit I'm not very familiar with either of these concepts, so here I was mostly a spectator, and that hasn't changed very much despite repeat visits to the episode. I still see both of these problems in an objective way contingent on a god-like view of human psychology, and psychology of sentience in general(Something humanity is far from grasping and have barely spent any energy thinking about in the grand scheme). My principles here are that 1) Morality is objective 2) Experience, no matter how good, if it's in relation to a sufficient negative, is bad, compared to the alternative of non-existence. I think that position covers a framing to both of those problems but doesn't really engage with them. I think this is probably the most intellectually stimulating conversation about AN that exists on the internet(Benatar's discussion with Peterson was a bit of a let down to me), so it's worth checking back on.

The lack of fairness in life is certainly worth hating, and freedom is certainly worth loving, but the left hates it for the wrong reasons. The left is the closest to being right about freedom and fairness today, but still leaves something to be desired from me.\n\nSince we're on the topic of(and out of) fairness: The right's strength is that it cares more about doing the right thing - and is more likely to do that right thing. That doesn't necessarily mean it knows what the right thing is(Spoiler warning: It doesn't). The atrocities of the right are born purely from this confusion, and a general stubbornness towards improving life on earth out of fear of ruining it for everyone(Which is good intentioned I'll admit). The right would prefer to rob you of freedom just to satisfy some sort of status quo, so they are the most authoritarian ideology. Religion certainly doesn't help their cause either, but religion and religious-like thinking is pretty much rampant across all major political ideologies.\n\nAnd I guess Libertarians are worth mentioning, who are just essentially a liberal-conservative hybrid, characterized by extreme narcissism and psychopathy masked by commitment to extreme \"fairness\", who think people can meaningfully \"deserve\" something in a world where people's lives, thoughts, and behaviors are characterized, as far as science can tell us, entirely by luck and happenstance. Libertarians, unlike the Left, makes a **cult** out of unfairness and celebrates this. If you're born to a heroin addicted mother in the Mumbai slums, to a libertarian, you just didn't work hard enough. If you're born to a long line of dynastic millionaires\/billionaires and grow up to become a billionaire yourself who exercises immense power over the world, you've earned this through your hard work. The strength of Libertarians is, they are probably the least tribal political ideology - which puts the left to shame.\n\n\nYou can get Antinatalist views, or oppose antinatalist views, from all of these positions, I suppose. But with the left in particular, I would guess AN is most often incompatible through a desire to subvert the order of the world, out of hatred for wealth and power. If you cannot reproduce, you can't make revolutionaries or protesters. This is why political ideology blinds everyone from making the most ethical choice on firm grounds. It is impossible to subscribe to a political ideology first, and then be on firm ethical ground second. The only pre-requisites one needs on the left to adopt AN is some combination of 1) Understanding that a lack of consent cannot justify creating something with potential to suffer. 2) Understanding that the world is full of suffering, is unstable, and it is unethical to risk the creation of new life. This view is also compatible with the idea that we currently live in a capitalist imperialist dystopia, and \"the game\" is unwinnable, making future children pointless soldiers against what they perceive as evil. 3) The asymmetry argument, although probably least compelling to someone who identifies with a political ideology, will do.\n\nThe only issue for Antinatalism and the left is what is essentially framed as a eugenics war - The wealthy and powerful covertly killing or making reproductively inert, those they deem undesirable, via chemical manipulation(the targetted spread of substances that cause infertility or disrupt\/modify genes), biological manipulation(the targetted modification of genes as a weapon) and psychological\/philosophical\/ideological manipulation(The use of ideas to castrate those the elite deems unfit - Ideas such as MGTOW, Birth Strikes, and even Antinatalism itself could be weaponized this way, if the left is correct about the degree to which this occurs). If the left wishes to fight against such a eugenics war, or believes such a war winnable, they would be aggressively in favor of natalism. If however, the left views this as a lost war, they should be more keen on abandoning natalism because the only outcome is pointless suffering of future children.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":1,"created_utc":1556426972,"distinguished":null,"edited":1556433424,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"elynngy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bi4yey","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_bi4yey","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/bi4yey\/an_the_left\/elynngy\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1559242456,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

When I first arrived to r\/antinatalism, I first argued that one weak point of AN is that the people most concerned with various problems (Life, suffering, etc), will stop reproducing. AN does not end dynastic rule of ultra elites, for example. The most powerful people alive, who have ruled historically, will continue to reproduce. The least ethically minded people alive, regardless of economic class\/world influence level, will continue to reproduce. The only thing that will die off in a direct memetic+genetic sense, will be a deep concern for the problem of suffering from a slice of the human population who essentially says, \"The game cannot be won.\" The other slice, people who are ethically minded which hold the position \"The game is winnable\", will continue to reproduce. \n\nSo there's that problem. \n\nThe second problem is potential of an AN-based eugenic model of social engineering. It needs not be mentioned that people who understand the game is rigged are problematic from the perspective of certain world players. But for the sake of clarity, an analogy:\n\n If the pawns, knights, rooks, etc on a chessboard suddenly gain sentience, ponder the nature of life, and realize they are doomed to be tossed around a board against their will, experience defeat even when the player wins, and protest to say \"This is pointless. This game is bad, from my perspective.\" That would be a problem. The player would be incentivized to crack the whip on the pawn, and say \"No. Your job is to be a pawn, and when your time is up, make more pawn babies to take your place. Go back to sleep.\"\n\nIn a certain sense, AN *can* conceivably be a eugenics model for recycling problem pawns and other more powerful pieces, because these pawns will be replaced by new pawns who will blindly behave well. The thing to understand in all of this, is weaponry evolves. Strategy evolves. Once upon a time, perhaps you wish to destroy your enemy with overt violence. As strategy evolves, this becomes more and more difficult. Now you must destroy your enemy quietly, by assassinating them in their sleep. As this strategy evolves further, perhaps now you murder your enemy by sabotaging the plane they're traveling in.

Psychopathy is deeply misunderstood, and hopefully time and scientific rigor will reveal a world teeming with psychopaths. People think of psychopathy, and immediately think of Ted Bundy or some caricature like Christian Bale's character. But they don't understand that psychopathy is just a toolkit evolution produced in humanity, in many ways very similar to the way camouflage functions in insects, fish, reptiles\/amphibians, birds, etc.\n\nIf being a stick insect was illegal and could get you arrested, only bad stick insects would get arrested. If being a stick insect gave you a tremendous advantage for ascending to power and ruling the planet earth, then stick insects would rule the planet earth. The bad ones would be killed, via natural selection. The most cunning and best camouflaged stick insects would become kings. The female stick insects, incentivized by evolutionary drives, would be helplessly drawn to the stick insects with the best camouflage, because that would mean the greatest chance for her baby stick insects to not just survive, but to thrive, which would insure 'throne-keeping ability' or 'winning'. They would then have children, raise them to be good stick insects like their father and mother, the King and Queen. And those children would have to survive in a world where there was constant pressure against stick insects - they would have to have the best camouflage to keep their throne - Often better than their parents, because everyone else learned some of their parent's tricks in the last generation. If your camouflage is better than anyone else's, you win. \n\nIf your psychopathy is better than everyone else's, there's no other \"thing\" that \"beats\" psychopathy - because psychopathy doesn't care about the rules, that is a tremendous advantage. If anything, psychopathy **invents** rules for it's enemies, which are then broken **by** psychopathy.

The intention really is the dealbreaker here. Take your example:\n\n&gt;Someone who, say, tosses a brick into the middle of a busy street is being malicious even if that person doesn't actually intend to hurt a specific person because that person intended to hurt someone, and this is even true if that person doesn't know for sure that someone will be hurt.\n\nTwo cases. \n\nCase 1) A 14 year old is suddenly filled with risk taking behavior, in the company of rambunctious friends and a new flood of testosterone, and is angry at a recent punishment his parents handed him.  On an overpass, he decides to impress his friends by throwing a brick onto a busy freeway, completely lost in the thought of his anger, rebellion, childishly chaotic behavior, and desire to fit into his group. The brick hits a windshield, and a family dies as a result.\n\nCase 2) A 14 year old has antisocial personality disorder. He is a sadist at 14, given that he was raped and tortured by mentally ill parents. As a result, he quite literally feels pleasure and excitement at the thought of injuring other human beings. In the past, when he gets in trouble, he very skillfully employs crocodile tears and turns into an innocent victim - a very skillful manipulation strategy he has learned in his years. He throws a brick into the busy freeway from an overpass, carefully aiming for a family inside a minivan. The brick hits it's target, a windshield, a family dies as a result.\n\n\nWords really do have meaning. A **intent** to do harm really matters, and not only describes the situation in a meaningful way, but says something very important about the **person** doing the action. The first behavior is certainly stupid, but it's **not** malicious. The second very clearly is. Your drunk driving scenario, again, is stupid, but **not** malicious. Malicious would be to quite literally say \"I'm going to get drunk tonight, I can't **wait** to kill some people as a result of not being able to drive, Hahahaha!\"\n\nYou appear to have a very moralizing view of the world, and think people really are conscious actors of intentionally bad behavior. The world is far less interesting than that, I'm afraid. No one has any idea what they're doing, they're just at the mercy of whatever thought or impulse pops into their brain. A smaller subset of people calculate their bad behavior, but even some of the worst criminals are just unlucky sociopathic robots.

I don't associate myself with it, it doesn't worry me or make me feel bad, nor do I feel there should be any urgency to treat this state(although it could be viable to treat it?). I don't believe depression is a real problem for human beings on planet Earth, not in the way it has been medicalized, at least. I wrote this the other day regarding depression elsewhere:\n\n&gt;It doesn't feel like a meaningful term to say someone suffers from depression.\n\n&gt;The thought experiment for understanding this, is imagining a psychiatric institution identical to that of the west, except mapped onto a place like North Korea. You wouldn't call a functional person in North Korea \"Mentally healthy\" and someone who the Psychiatric institution of North Korea deems \"mentally unhealthy\/depressed\" as such.\n\n&gt;Because the mentally healthy person, is deeply confused, through no fault of their own, about the nature of their reality. While the mentally unhealthy person, is either traumatized as a result of, or in touch with, the reality they live in.\n\n&gt;Depression functions in a very similar way in the western world as in the thought experiment. It puts the blame on the victim, rather than the perpetrators or the cause of the symptom(or invents false, unscientific causes like \"A chemical imbalance\" which begs the question - what causes the imbalance? - As it turns out, growing up in a shit world raped by psychopaths causes a chemical imbalance).\n\nI did not spell the point out in my post, but I'll do it here. The point is, it doesn't feel correct to say someone is depressed when they're a human being on Earth in the same way it doesn't feel correct to say a golden retriever locked in a cage for life is depressed. It could be an accurate description, but to describe it this way fails to describe the problem, obfuscating or ignoring it.\n\nSo I almost want to bypass your question and point out that people who have depression have a sort of irrational neurotic guilt, a voice in their head that says something like:\n\n\"**Sighs**..\n\n... I can't lie to myself. I'm *depressed*. And *that* means my bleak views of the world are somehow in doubt, or delusional, or a mistaken result of my depression.\"\n\nI want to bypass that sort of thinking entirely and say that is not even a real problem.
