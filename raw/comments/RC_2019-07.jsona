At the social level, the state level, the ideological level, the level of gender, culture, all the overlapping tribes you belong to are at war with some other tribe.\n\nFirst it's crucial to understand that if reality is negative, being in touch with reality is a psychological and therefore evolutionary weakness. The more in touch you are with a deeply negative reality, the less rewarding it feels to move through such a reality, the more this is expressed by you, and the worse it bodes for your fitness as a gene(or even meme) carrier. If you suddenly learned that you exist in a hellish torture chamber for the pointless amusement of someone more powerful than you could ever hope to defeat, you would be wise to kill yourself. You would be wise to hit \"Exit Game, Don't save progress\". The game is objectively **lost** in such a state. When we play games we understand, we can understand we've lost prior to the game ending, and we are wise to quit in these instances. In the game of life, we simply cannot know for sure that we've already lost, so it's far more problematic. \n\nThis is the realm of *truth*. But when it comes to *survival* rather than truth, being delusional is an **advantage**. Your team mates, specifically your team leader, **never** wants you to surrender. Being delusional means to live and fight another day, even if living and fighting are both pointless. And as mentioned before, you are a soldier in the 'armies' you belong to. From a selective, strategic, survival standpoint, you don't want your soldiers to just kill themselves when they realize war is hell.

The reason is those positive memes are spread through natalism, and antinatalism will likely never overtake natalism.

I'm not claiming it's her responsibility, I'm simply stating a fairly uncontroversial fact. Again:\n\nIf you were so unlucky as to be a socially awkward(at best) human being guaranteed to make people deeply uncomfortable, you would *want* people to signal reality to you. You wouldn't want to be in some psychopathic Truman-show esque running gag where people fuck around with wedding rings to protect themselves from what ultimately is your misfortunate. That's a **mentally ill world**, which is the sort of world we live in today. Everyone is psychotic, or psychopathic, or both, essentially. You can either be part of the problem and play insane mindgames with people and further the insanity in the world, or you can simply be straightforward with people, which is precisely what any well intentioned but unlucky person would want. If this person is *not* simply a social idiot, and malicious, well then that'll be clear rather quickly too. Now we can really avoid this person. \n\n\nThis is simply the basis of all ethics, the golden rule. To treat others as you'd want to be treated. You don't want to be manipulated, so **don't** manipulate others. You don't want to be lied to, so **don't** lie to others. You don't want to be harassed, so **don't** harass others. Of course, we are a completely self-absorbed species, so we break this rule and cleverly rationalize that we're right for breaking it.\n\nYour negative interactions with people are either:\n\n1) Positive instances in the big picture, where you now know someone is hostile or unwilling to interact in a civil way. This is also positive *for* the hostile person, because this is yet *another* feedback from reality to them saying *their* behavior is out of line. This is simply *better* than living in a world where hostile people never actually get feedback and continue ruining the world for people until they die.\n\nor\n\n2) An opportunity to self-reflect on your own behavior. Perhaps **you** are wrong here(or *both* of you are wrong, because you know, reality is complicated and you're not the main character of a drama?), since you too are merely human, and, when honest with yourself, should be able to admit that you're perfectly capable of acting like an utterly horrible person without realizing it. \n\nIt's simply a win for you, no matter which of these is the case.

But in more clear cases, like the truth, we can. People almost always want the truth. How you tell the truth is important, of course, I'm not suggesting to be rude or insensitive. There's a time and place for this too. But when you boil things down, no one *wants* to be lied to and manipulated. You want to move through reality in a way that is informed, so you can avoid situations which you accept only because you're ignorant of some information. If you *knew* this information which was intentionally withheld from you, you *wouldn't* accept this situation, right?\n\nThis is a basic courtesy to give to everyone. And perhaps there's someone out there who will say \"I just don't care about the truth, I want to be completely delusional\". Fine then. You can't please everyone. But it's a bit much to justify lying just because such a person may exist. Almost everyone wants to be in touch with reality because then you give them the feedback needed for them to see the world the way it is, and this rewards both you *and* the person you're dealing with.\n\nThen there's the burden of keeping up with lies. Imagine you're out with an acquaintance and they bump into someone close to them. This person asks them what time they'll meet tomorrow for a big expensive event this friend bought tickets to, which they agreed to go to a month in advance. Flustered, this person on the fly invents a story you know is completely false based on your day with them, fabricated to avoid going because they changed their mind on a whim.

BUT THEY NEVER SEEM TO ACTUALLY FIX THE PROBLEM! \n\nThat's because suicide and bullying are not problems from the perspective of social hierarchy. On a superficial level, the lie everyone believes is that suicide is a tragedy, and bullying is horrible. But both of these things *benefit* society from the perspective of natural selection, which is why they are not wiped out after thousands of years.\n\nThe purpose of bullying is to make sure the most dominant young men and women socialize themselves. These people then become CEO's, reach managerial positions, etc. The utility of allowing children and teenagers to torture each other is for these people to \"learn\" how to control their psychopathic tendencies, also to organize people into a social competition. The ones who are highly dominant human beings but fail to socialize, become sociopaths and many of them reach prison eventually. But if you are highly dominant and you succeed through the obstacle course of school, you become an apex psychopath or are situated highly on human hierarchy, and rule over other human beings in your future. You get the ideal mate, you get power over others in life, etc. The more dominant and more perfect your psychopathy(Which means, the better you can hide your domination from both yourself, and others), the higher position you'll reach in life.\n\nSuicide works in the opposite way. Instead of selecting the \"best\" of a society, it selects against the \"worst\". Suicide occurs when someone reaches their limit. A person who reaches their limit, is not desirable to society. Society wants people to kill themselves in order to \"cull the weak\". \n\nOf course, there's nothing meaningfully strong or weak about bullies or the suicidal. It's just an amoral, mindless process due to genes, parenting and happenstance of environments.\n\nWhy does a society allow such insanity? Simple. It needs to compete against other societies. So the society which ends bullying, and ends suicide, has an objectively weaker society, and gets dominated by the enemy society which **doesn't** end bullying and suicide. \n\nNature creates sadism and horror because it benefits beings and systems of beings. And that which benefits, gets the green light. It has nothing to do with ethics, morality, truth, virtue, etc. Zero. This is why the world is a dystopian hellscape.

I never claimed to be perfect, nor did I claim it was easy. I just said it was the **right** thing to do, and by lying in uncomfortable scenarios causes yourself and others misery in the short and long term. Do you have some objection to this claim?

I've never described myself as a \"great guy\", and you can scour my post history and find nothing of the sort. The user name doesn't mean I think I'm compassionate, it was just an amusing, nonsensical concept that came to mind when I was forced to type in *something*. Cats aren't compassionate, they are mindless, manipulative and self absorbed creatures who are extremely good at getting the interest of humans. To juxtapose compassion there, was amusing to me.\n\nNotice again how this hostile attitude robs you of a more meaningful interaction.\n\n&gt;In life, I have had several friends whom many described as \"beatific\".

Their presence--even thinking of them--instantly brings the raging beast inside me to heel. Your posts don't emanate peace and humility--not even close.\n\nI guess that can only mean one thing: Your gut instinct is completely right. The presence of a strong attachment of benevolence to your friends, and total lack of attachment to me demonstrates that your friends are amazing, and I'm horrible. I'm simply a total fraud here.\n\n&gt;So quit preaching about 'honesty'. You're not fooling anyone. Let people wear rings and say they're gay if it helps them avoid more emotionally-charged, potentially dangerous situations.\n\nI won't quit \"preaching\" about honesty in every day scenarios, because it's what I think every generic human being deserves, and what causes the greatest positive outcome, and lowest negative outcome. I'm not holding a gun to anyone's head and telling them to never lie or even to not lie sometimes, nor would I moralize anyone for failing to tell the truth. It's also true that some situations demand lying because the alternative is truly disastrous(Nowhere did I explicitly say to **never** lie), but there aren't many of these situations in life, and people make themselves and others miserable by resorting to lies whenever it's convenient.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1562138564,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"esnmbzo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c81j7g","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_esn5tuk","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/c81j7g\/playing_hard_to_get\/esnmbzo\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1571304867,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Let\u2019s use a hot button example from the current U.S. culture: abortion. To some, abortion is an absolute evil, the murder of a human being. To others, it is a medical procedure that should be a guaranteed right for all\n\nDisagreement about ethics doesn't mean that ethics are subjective. You can disagree about any scientific fact too. You can say \"I disagree that the earth is a sphere.\" You can utter this statement 8,000 years ago before we had the ability to demonstrate if the Earth was a sphere or not, and in no way would this put into doubt the objective nature of reality. The problem of being unable to measure, or seeing an unsolvable disagreement, would never suggest we live in a relativist world in regards to reality. Ethics is grounded in words that have meanings, and make logical sense. The ethics of abortion are not decided by opinion, or democratic vote; this is decided by an objective analysis of the actual ethical transgression that occurs, or whether a transgression occurs at all, which would make abortion ethically neutral at minimum, or ethically beneficial.\n\nClearly, it's complicated, but that doesn't make it subjective.  \n\n&gt;If there were no sentient beings that existed, two plus two would still equal four. This is concrete, discrete, and provable. If there were no sentient beings who existed, there would be no good or evil, because there would be no one to apply the terms, no one to whom the concepts have any relevance to begin with. \nI'm glad we agree on the objectivity of mathematical truth. Ethics is no different here, and you'll find that you're actually making the correct move when it applies to math, which is: \"Even if there is no one to **do** math, mathematical propositions are still **true**. The fact that there is no one around to whom the concepts would have any relevance is itself **irrelevant** to the truth of math.\"\n\nBut you fail to do this with ethics:\n\n&gt; If there were no sentient beings who existed, there would be no good or evil, because there would be no one to apply the terms, no one to whom the concepts have any relevance to begin with.\n\nIf you examine this closely, you'll find that the facts of ethics are no different from the facts of mathematics epistemologically.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1562152682,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"esnwd9m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c85h7b","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_esnv50r","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/c85h7b\/a_thick_skull_only_a_mother_could_love\/esnwd9m\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1571309630,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I'll claim you're too optimistic, and that your optimism ensures you and others like you, and your children, slave along. Golly, who could benefit from such a thing?\n\nOptimism bias is unique in that there's no symmetrical counterpart with pessimism bias. The term exists, but we don't really identify people being blinded by pessimism(except by those blinded by optimism.) The reason here is that optimism bias is a survival advantage, while pessimism is maladaptive. There are other malfunctions of the brain, like [wishful thinking](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wishful_thinking).\n\nWishful thinking is the formation of beliefs and making decisions according to what might be pleasing to imagine instead of by appealing to evidence, rationality, or reality. Studies have consistently shown that holding all else equal, subjects will predict positive outcomes to be more likely than negative outcomes (see [valence effect](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Optimism_bias#Valence_effect)).\n\nThen there's the whopper of [Optimism bias](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Optimism_bias) itself, which via the aforementioned valence effect, *scales* the delusional optimism the more negative a scenario is presented. Are we in an inescapable hell right now? Well... no! We can't be! Nothing is inescapable. :)\n\nThis effect is very powerful, both in survival, and in [*literally* manifesting competence and success](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pygmalion_effect).\n\nAgain, no one enjoys hearing the dark truth. They want their coffee with cream and sugar. The ape brain is modeled to be delusional. \n\n&gt;    \"The man who is a pessimist before forty-eight knows too much; if he is an optimist after it he knows too little.\" --Mark Twain\n\n=\n&gt;   \"I also think the future is where people project a lot of hopes. They're just less willing to be neutral about it. People are more willing to say, 'Yes, sad and terrible things happened in the past, but we get it.

You will begin to notice thoughts and sensations, rather than *being* caught up in the storm of thoughts and sensations. This is how you know it's working.

Because I know the problem isn't as simple as giving the money away if the outcome is a one time payment of 1,250. The whole system is insane and depraved. 1,250 USD is something like a month or two of rent in LA, depending on if you're paying the minimum or not.\n\nThat's how futile this all is.

You may as well send that money to a third world country where your charity has something like 10+ times the impact per dollar, but even then, where's the true incentive for a billionaire to do this? When you look around, you'll find that there's just not much of one. If the incentive was strong, people would naturally do these things. That's just how ape brains work.

I consider a starting point of pessimism to be a benchmark of being in touch with reality. There's no symmetrical concept to Optimism bias. Pessimism bias exists, but we bear the burden of being the products of things that were selected for optimism. Pessimism on the other hand, was maladaptive. The hilarious contrast here is something like [depressive realism](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Depressive_realism), which doesn't have the strongest evidence for, but is a sound enough concept.\n\nThe nature of suffering on the planet and in history is a kind of esoteric knowledge. Once you've gained it, most optimism simply appears delusional. But until this link has been created, it's simply impossible to create a coherent conversation about optimism and pessimism, because people are describing different realities. It's not only a matter of being grounded in the quantity and quality of suffering at every moment, but the *reasons* why such things exist, namely, the evolutionary reasons. The amoral, mindless evolutionary reasons, which create endless illusions because it benefits a certain class of organism, including us, but specifically, the absolute top of human hierarchy currently and throughout history.\n\nA reasonably content life does wonders in propelling optimism, and robbing one of being in touch with how much [suffering](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=14), how poor [quality of life gets](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=985), on the [planet](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3445), and throughout [history](https:\/\/www.cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/). Even being introduced to the evidence, the brain of such a person is simply 'phobic' to these things, they don't sink in, they slide off, the way droplets slide off of an umbrella. Rationalization is the knee-jerk survival mechanism here, the *same* survival mechanism which guarantees horror today, and guarantees horror tomorrow - evolution simply doesn't care, it's a meat grinder, and it's greatest trick is making it's highest ranking beneficiaries camouflaged, much like this [caterpillar](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv). Nature can do this, it can also camouflage homo sapiens, and this would be a very powerful trick, for very powerful people. People who benefit from no empathy, from being highly domineering, from being callous, manipulative, deceptive, charming, and just natural born \"Kings\" who would not hesitate to sacrifice whatever peasants necessary to \"win\" the evolutionary game. The aforementioned deception, manipulation, and charm, wrap up the entire package. They fertilize optimism in non-elite apes. Don't think too much, stay positive, chin up, work hard, we're the good guys. This is the world we live in, and have lived in for thousands of years. Again, this is not symmetrical to some depressive bias causing one to fail to see the good in the world, due to the reasons previously mentioned. Good isn't much of a consolation, nor is altruism -- these things are co-opted and gain mythological status because it benefits a certain elite class of homo sapiens in their ancient competition against other similar elite classes of homo sapiens.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":1,"created_utc":1562249351,"distinguished":null,"edited":1562260072,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"essceum","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_c928l5","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_essaja8","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/c928l5\/peter_watts_attack_of_the_hope_police_delusional\/essceum\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1571386868,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Watts claims to be a realist, but I believe that he has a strong negative bias, probably unconscious in origin.\n\nWell, that depends on the nature of the reality we're describing. If you're an anti-realist, you simply can't say reality could be more negative or positive. \"It'll just be\", as Zen Buddhism says. I'm claiming reality **is** more negative than positive, specifically the nature of being swept up in a chain of self replication and competition at the mercy of amoral and blind processes-- the \"meat grinder\".\n\n&gt;The reasons I call him a pessimist are mostly outlined above, but in short it's because he seems to discount many low-hanging solutions to his apocalyptic problems.\n\nI think it's very reasonable to discount these, given the context I painted in my previous post.\n\n&gt;We as a generation have the greatest amount of awareness of the true extent and prevalence of suffering on this planet, and the awareness that most of it is senseless suffering for no good reason. That does not change the fact that, for the vast majority of indices we can use to measure quality of life, almost all of them have been steadily improving and are at the highest they've ever been. Watts believes that trend will change, but from what I can tell it's unlikely to. This is the best time every to be alive, in human history, for the average person.\n\nWe also live in a time where the apex of human hierarchical domination has been crystallized and distilled to it's greatest strength ever. We sit on the cusp of complete surveillance and information domination, something that has never occurred in history. Hiding, even in one's own mind, will be impossible, if it is not already.\n\n&gt;The universe and evolution are amoral, but what of it? Where some say that discovering that there's no Ultimate Moral Truth waiting out to be discovered makes life pointless, I say that it's all the more reason to live life to its fullest on our own terms. Our goals are no less in importance because there's no Objective Umpire to tell us that they're good or bad.\n\nI have no issues with coping with nihilism since I reject it completely-- I'm a moral realist, so you're not preaching to the right choir here. Morality is completely objective in the same sense mathematics is as far as I can see.\n\n&gt;You say the universe is an illusion. But 'illusion' implies that there's a deeper 'reality' to compare it to. But if this universe is an illusion, then so am I, and thus this universe is 'real' enough for me..\n\nWell, no, not quite. I'm simply saying natural selection produces countless illusions, because these illusions are **useful** for certain creatures. Certain illusions are useful for *certain* hairless apes which rule over us both, and we bear their burden when we attempt to interpret reality. Interpreting reality isn't impossible, you can certainly discover you're **in** hell if that happens to be the case, at the very least by accident. Even a schizophrenic could discover such a fact and have it lock into place and coalesce into a representation of reality that is highly accurate, and it would be just as in touch with reality as a scientific attempt to glean such information. It just so happens that one is the antithesis of pragmatic methodology, and the other is the best method we know regarding being in touch with reality.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1562251104,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"essfsdq","is_submitter":true,"link_id":"t3_c928l5","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_esse75h","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/c928l5\/peter_watts_attack_of_the_hope_police_delusional\/essfsdq\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1571388457,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

The very capitalist economics that made it a threat are also, harnessed properly, providing the tools to deal with it. That's not a given by fiat, but it does seem to be the case for this particular problem.\n\nWe probably agree here, since I'm not a doomsayer who believes Climate change will destroy everything. I think that would likely be a huge fortune if it could happen painlessly somehow, but even painfully, would be a NU win. However, this simply doesn't stand a chance of happening. What will happen could certainly be catastrophic on some level, but the winners will absolutely climb out of the ordeal, and it won't be some random lucky homo sapiens either, It'll be the apes most fit to pull trolley-problem levers for their own benefit(except replacing the lone person with some sort of generic utility-- not much of a trolley problem I guess), as has been happening for eons.\n\n&gt;I'm curious as to why you support moral realism, since as far as I can tell, it seems to be a fundamentally inaccurate belief. If you have something you feel can change my mind on the matter, I'll gladly read it, since I'm genuinely confused as to how we came to disagree here.\n\n&gt;I agree that evolution has no incentive to produce maps that are accurate representations of reality beyond the fact that accurate maps are usually good maps, and let you navigate reality better and achieve your goals. This can and has resulted in cognitive blindspots, and an optimism bias in humans. My reasons for holding my aforementioned beliefs seems to be stronger than the natural bias towards believing things will be OK, and while it's true that depressed or pessimistic people tend to have more accurate beliefs, that still doesn't make Watts right about his.\n\nI think we only disagree on optimism vs. pessimism and the negative nature of the universe. You're right in identifying that I am bootstrapping here to the level of consciousness, which is the only domain where words actually have meaning in a context of conceptual frameworks. As far as I see it, in the same way \"Two rocks and two rocks make four rocks\" is true in a universe with nothing, not even rocks, \"Taking a nail gun to a child's feet for your own amusement is bad\" is true in an empty universe. These propositions simply describe the behavior and qualities of variables within systems. I've not found a good argument for why we should reject objective moral frameworks for certain reasons which *can't* also be applied for rejecting scientific or rational objective frameworks with those same reasons, or which don't suffer from a reductio into something like solipsism where we simply reject everything other than the reality of our own experience as such. We must do bootstrapping, Hume should be ignored, consciousness matters, words have real meanings and exist in objective, conceptual systems waiting to be discovered, is roughly the approach I subscribe to.\n\n&gt;In the end, as 'blindsight' as a medical condition shows,'cogito' does not 'ergo sum', but I've seen no better way of existing than to accept our sensory inputs with basic sanity-checks. And even if I were to be convinced otherwise, I don't foresee any change in my behaviour arising from it, which makes it a moot point.\n\nIf I could edit Descartes, It would be \"I experience, therefore consciousness is real\".\n\n&gt;However, I think we've drifted a bit from the initial topic, and while I find your concerns about surveillance and the end of privacy very much justified, I only disagreed regarding Watts predictions for the Climate Change!\n\nWell this is embarrassing -- but what were his predictions? I admit my attention only really piqued at the second half of the video, particularly with the text I quoted.

Forums should be idea generators, and they should promote creativity and give lots of room to deviate from the norm, which is not something we necessarily want to give lots of room for in scientific trials, where we don't care about free expression unless it involves the free expression of substantive evidence.\n\nNow, this doesn't mean we don't care about rationality at all in a discussion forum. We still want good arguments. But it's sufficient to let an argument stand or fall on it's merits. If a fruitful discussion can come from arguing for some conspiracy theory, that's great. If nothing fruitful comes from it, then that can be dismissed just as easily. There's nothing *about* a conspiracy theory or something that sounds like one, that makes it intrinsically false.

Evidence required for species being fine would need to be a whale of a tale. Negative prophecies pose a serious risk of self-fulfillment, could lead to hell or avert hell. Unclear.)\n\nWhy the \"whale of a tale\"? Simply because current evidence suggests a psychopathic meat grinder hellhole, unless one is drunk on optimism bias, and has not scanned the present and past for suffering due to a comfortable hedonic life. To be a victim of the world is to have a kind of esoteric knowledge. All of this is controversial\/insane to anyone drunk with perspectival bias, alas. And no, the perspectives are simply not symmetrical, 'chocolate\/vanilla' distinctions. There's more meaningful esoteric knowledge in the badness of the world, than there is in the goodness, because goodness with an ignorance of badness does not have the same character as badness with an ignorance of goodness. If you're in the following [torture scenario](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/H9U6OOP.png)(Warning: Extremely graphic torture scene and NSFW), or having to bear the life of the [following child](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=985)(Graphic retelling of sexual abuse\/NSFW) it does nothing towards the quality of experience to discover that someone, somewhere, is having the time of their life laughing to tears, is involved in spiritual bliss, or having the most rockin' sex of their lives while on MDMA. However, if you **are** having the time of your life, the simple existence that you live in the sort of world where the former torture takes place *does* detract from the quality of experience(Unless one is a psychopath). Suddenly, things *aren't* so great. That's the core of my argument: There is suffering *everywhere*, absolute brutal sadism, as a result of our genes, and we are essentially hedonistically hallucinating in a hellscape, when we *ought* not to. My argument for why this occurs is  Psychopathy+Psychosis is intrinsic to just about all, if not all of homo sapiens.\n\nYou essentially need to make a gamble on which scenario you exist in. I think the clear common gamble is to simply argue for reality as it appears. If we can identify the exact nature of reality, it's our best shot as averting the worst hell. Currently there is a disagreement on what that nature is, so all we can do is express representations and argue for them.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1562440876,"distinguished":null,"edited":1562464207,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"et3xn86","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_c9qg36","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_et3tiax","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/c9qg36\/the_psychology_of_antifa\/et3xn86\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1571589691,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

An example would be, suppose China began offering all of its Buddhists free, state funded abortions, euthanasia, and sterilizations. In some sense its possible to see this as a net win for the world. What could be bad about incentives to produce less children, and painlessly end life if the situation demands it?\n\nThe problem here is the motive. China could win with such a policy in that it's an attempt to cleanse \"nice guy\" memes from its land in preparation for its domination of the world, as it does with its [Uyghur mass forced propaganda prisons](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WmId2ZP3h0c). To be clear, I'm not singling China out here, all nations are engaged in some sort of anti-human propaganda game, in being forced to compete with others doing the same.

Let's take a few points on this list an analyze them in the context of the life she was given.\n\n* Having a Child\n\nI don't doubt that having a child can *feel* incredibly fulfilling. If it didn't, we wouldn't be here. Evolution creates strong incentives around children, this is obvious. But Elisabeth bore 7 children after being raped by her father in the dungeon he kept her in for nearly 25 years. These births were terrifying, painful, unsanitary, and must have been absolutely psychologically beyond words. Can you imagine it? Just close your eyes. If you're a man, you have to imagine you're a woman-- you were a *girl* who was forced into a dungeon by your father. He has raped you many times now on his almost daily visits. You're in pain, and your stomach has bloated with his child because he didn't even bother to use a condom. You're about to go into labor. **Again**. It's happening **again** You've been raped again and again and again and again and now your body is **forcing** another child from out of you. Blood. Immense pain. Can you even cry any more? Are you just a shell of a person at this point? What is this? How many years have passed? Where are we? Oh god... the pain... \n\nTears flow, but on a dead, expressionless face too dissociated to even beg for death...\n\n\n* A Happy Home\n\nYou've been beaten, raped, and stuck in a box. The stench of blood, piss, and shit is everywhere. It gets worse. It's not just yours, but also of your 7 children, one of which died before you, three of which were taken from you, and three which you now have to explain the world to, who look up to you, as mother. What do you tell them? Their constant cries fall on deaf ears and a dead mind. A long time ago, we were terrified because we couldn't even sleep knowing that the next rape was hours away. We cried and cried for help until we were physically and mentally exhausted. We begged everyone and everything. Please... let us go. Stop the pain. **\"WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?! WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?!\"**\n\nYou have to turn your face to your child, who looks on in confusion, mid-rape. The mind just shuts down to survive another day...\n\nI don't need to take every point on this \"Top 10 Pleasure\" list because that would be overkill, but I'm sure you get the point by now. Good food, a great book, traveling, cinema, while these are pleasures some people enjoy, there are countless contexts in the world where people simply *don't* get these experiences. These are the experienced of a privileged few on Earth, and they're distinct to only one species. The species which we enslave and the people we dominate don't get good food or travel or a happy home, they get hellish conditions similar to Elisabeth's. The most obscene part is that there's something pathological about waxing poetic about how great life can be in light of the awful things that happen on a daily basis. This does not work in reverse.

A 'loss' for the less developed world struggling to 'catch up'.\n\nIn this sense, Antinatalism is potentially a weaponized meme aimed at countries like India or any other power who is 'racing' in the dominate-or-be-dominated game.

Picture an Asian tsunami of the sort we saw in 2004, that killed a quarter of a million people. One of those, every ten days, killing children only under five. That\u2019s 20, 24,000 children a day, a thousand an hour, 17 or so a minute. That means before I can get to the end of this sentence, some few children, very likely, will have died in terror and agony. Think of the parents of these children. Think of the fact that most of these men and women believe in God, and are praying at this moment for their children to be spared. And their prayers will not be answered. Any God who would allow children by the millions to suffer and die in this way, and their parents to grieve in this way, either can do nothing to help them, or doesn\u2019t care to. He is therefore either impotent or evil.\n\n&gt;And worse than that, most of these people\u2014\u2013many of these people, certainly\u2014\u2013will be going to Hell because they\u2019re praying to the wrong God. Just think about that. Through no fault of their own, they were born into the wrong culture, where they got the wrong theology, and they missed the revelation. There are 1.2 billion people in India at this moment. Most of them are Hindus, most of them therefore are polytheists. No matter how good these people are, they are doomed. If you are, if you are praying to the Monkey God Hanuman, you are doomed. You\u2019ll be tortured in Hell for eternity. Now, is there the slightest evidence for this? No. It just says so in Mark 9, and Matthew 13, and Revelation 14. Ok, perhaps you\u2019ll remember from The Lord of the Rings, it says when the elves die, they go to Valanor, but they can be reborn in Middle Earth. I say that just as a point of comparison.\n\n&gt;So God created the cultural isolation of the Hindus. He *engineered* the circumstance of their deaths in ignorance of revelation, and then he created the penalty for this ignorance, which is an eternity of conscious torment in fire. On the other hand, your run-of-the-mill serial killer in America, who spent his life raping and torturing children, need only come to God- come to Jesus, on Death Row, and after a final meal of fried chicken, he\u2019s going to spend an eternity in Heaven after death. One thing should be **crystal** clear to you: This vision of life has absolutely nothing to do with moral accountability.\n\n&gt;And please notice the double standard used to exonerate God from all this evil. We\u2019re told that God is loving, and kind, and just, and intrinsically good; but when someone like myself points out the rather obvious and compelling evidence that God is cruel and unjust, because he visits suffering on innocent people, of a scope and scale that would embarrass the most ambitious psychopath, we\u2019re told that God is mysterious. \u201cWho can understand God\u2019s will?\u201d And yet, this is precisely\u2014 this \u201cmerely human\u201d understanding of God\u2019s will, is precisely what believers use to establish his goodness in the first place. You know, something good happens to a Christian, he feels some bliss while praying, say, or he sees some positive change in his life, and we\u2019re told that God is good. But when children by the tens of thousands are torn from their parents\u2019 arms and drowned, we\u2019re told that God is mysterious. This is how you play tennis without the net.\n\n&gt;And I want to suggest to you, that it is not only tiresome when otherwise-intelligent people speak this way, it is morally reprehensible. This kind of faith is really the perfection of narcissism. \u201cGod loves me, dontcha know? He cured me of my eczema. He makes me feel so good while singing in church, and, and just when we had given up hope, we found a banker who was willing to reduce my mother\u2019s mortgage.\" Given all the good\u2014all that this God of yours does **not** accomplish in the lives of others, given the misery that\u2019s being imposed on some helpless child at this instant, this kind of faith is obscene.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1562764257,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"etf9md4","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cawjio","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_cawjio","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/cawjio\/my_religious_parents_are_freaking_out\/etf9md4\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1571783859,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

You\u2019re more likely to drop out and become a criminal. Fall into the wrong crowd and end up dead or in jail.\n\nRight, this is true, but it really depends on what we mean here by \"neglect\". Evolution works in insane, counter-intuitive ways. These are not guarantees towards success, rather they're just strategies that need to work more often than not. Being brutal to your child is a survival strategy. A sociopath to me is the sort of thug you describe, a failed psychopath. Failed psychopaths get arrested, hollywood movies depict them, etc. But we always get this cartoonish version, never quite the real thing -- the real thing is highly successful, highly manipulative, callous, charming(Not necessarily in a superficial way, often in a highly convincing way), etc. Evolution is a master of eventually creating insane [camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv), if given enough time.\n\nNeglect from a mother simply grooms a child to see people less as people, but as objects. In a world that is a psychopathic capitalist rat race, this is an adaptation, even though to *us* observers it's repugnant. The problem is, there's no \"right crowd\", really. It's just a dominance game, just a pyramid scheme. Psychopathy simply can't lose to another phenotypic strategy. Just imagine your favorite sport or video game. Imagine the best player alive from said sport. Now imagine a version of that player, who is identical in skill, just has the following qualities *added* on:\n\n* More manipulative and cunning\n* More deceptive\n* Domineering, has an extra insatiable egomaniacal thirst to \"win\"\n* Callous - feels no empathy towards those they compete with\n* Charming - Is far more skilled at smiling  for the cameras, is naturally lovable in how easily they manipulate others socially.\n\nThis is simply an *upgrade* when you think about it from an evolutionary or competitive standpoint. This is the world we live in. We get fed a steady diet of propaganda about what a psychopath is: An evil guy in a jumpsuit. That is simply not an accurate representation, that image is essentially an evolutionary failure, and there's simply a better version of that that **gets away with it** and has a skillset to make them **seem** the good guy.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1562871928,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"etjehnw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cbw892","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_etjdbnr","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/cbw892\/stfu_ny_times\/etjehnw\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1571854713,"score":8,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I wouldn't pretend that my partner could satisfy all of my sexual needs exactly the way I want, that's just some fairy tale bullshit, right? I'd be enthusiastic about helping them orgasm if that's what they wanted, but if they wanted something I couldn't give them and my partner wanted to look at porn, I'd be glad for them in the same way I'd be glad they're looking at a show on Netflix they enjoy but I don't. After all, I can't create a Netflix special to entertain them with, can I? That's an absurd expectation. Sex is no different. You simply can't be perfect for another person - you can only be you. Now, if your bedroom is dead and they're spending hours on pornhub every day, that's another story. But occasional porn? We're human beings. Insecure, imperfect human beings. Horny human beings. And that's fine as long as we acknowledge that we're all insecure and imperfect in some way. And horny.\n\nSo don't take this response as \"You should never be envious of videos of naked people\", because it's complicated. You're a human being too. It's true that it does hurt to have your partner engaging a very partner-y ... thing... without you. Every human wants attention. Every human feels good when people care about them, especially sexually. So I'm not suggesting you're selfish. This is sort of where the complexity of a relationship comes in, and here I have no helpful advice alas. Here's where my level headed advice turns into cynicism, so you've been warned. I think relationships almost always have a toxic dynamic to some degree, of one person getting the upper hand somehow, sometimes(often?) bordering on or escalating into clear abuse. Either one person is lying to themselves, or both people are lying to themselves, and either both people are getting a crappy deal, or one person is. It's so rare, maybe impossible, for two people to be happy together.\n\nBut I'm not saying this to bum you out, I'm just saying that's what I see as reality. If you discover this is also how reality works based on your own experiences, then that can be empowering. Then you can tell yourself something like: \"Okay... I know relationships are bullshit, and I know what I'm in for, and I know what my boundaries are, and I know this relationship is going to be full of flaws and human stupidity, and I accept and acknowledge that.\" By doing this, you at least immunize from being disappointed when you discover your partner is more or less being an asshole(Not saying they are, just saying it's kind of inevitable from my own bleak yet realistic view of things).","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1562888981,"distinguished":null,"edited":1562948352,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"etk4wy9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cc3357","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_cc3357","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/cc3357\/dae_get_hurt_by_knowing_their_partner_watches_porn\/etk4wy9\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1571867339,"score":-4,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

But lately I just zoom out and see a completely psychopathic species. A benevolent alien race would look upon our species with disgust and pity. Disgust because we're all monsters, even the nice ones. Just playing pretend. Many of the ones who seem nice are the biggest monsters of all. And pity, because we're unlucky to be the victims of being born to a long line of apes who played a meat grinder survival game, and therefore have been forced onto brains that doom us to behave in antisocial ways, many of which appear perfectly social, but ultimately serve antisocial purposes.

This may sound nebulous, but everything is a tradeoff. All you can do is try to fix yourself and try to be of service to others when you can. Just don't be a schmuck. \n\nThis is pretty good in characterizing some pretty viral memes going around. You can throw Stoicism into this too. The Zen Buddhist, \"It just is\". Keep your chin up, too. One foot in front of the other. Be ambitious. It gets better. You win some you lose some.\n\nWhat do these aphorisms have in common? They benefit a certain class of people, and I'm not referring to the bearers of the memes, even though it can be argued that an optimist benefits as a result of being optimistic. A lot of these are nonsensical, and circular, like \"It is what it is\" and \"It just is\". Other Stoic-esque concepts too sound amazingly noble, until you realize that 'the covert tyrant king'(figuratively, literally-- it doesn't matter) is conceivably the ultimate beneficiary of a peasantry of Stoics. \n\nIt's true that Stoicism has adaptive value. A Stoic has better odds of surviving hardship than a Pessimist, for example. But... is surviving really the bullseye in all cases? What if you're in a dystopia that's been locked from the top-down? What if you're in Psychopathic hallucinatory hierarchy-ville(It's extremely interesting to abstractly envision what this looks like... it's sort a joke for me to suggest envisioning it.) What if you're a cow in [cow hell](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3296)? Let's plug in some of the former aphorisms.\n\nFirst, an important preface: \"This may sound nebulous, but...\"\n\n*speaking to the cow*\n\n* \"It is what it is.\" \n* \"We are what we are.\"\n* \"It just is.\" *characteristic Zen laughter*\n* \"Keep your chin up.\"\n* \"It gets better.\"\n\nThese memes basically serve one ultimate purpose. They may sound like helpful survival tools, but they're co-opted by apex psychopathy to enslave everything sitting under a very narrow tippy point of a pyramidal structure. Could we say the cows in cow hell have \"adaptive genes\" because they got our attention as meat and dairy producing objects, therefore propagating these genes? We could say yes and close the case if we had some sort of brain anomaly that prevented us from seeing a problem with suffering, but to anyone else this is absurd(Helpful reminder for context: You live in a world dominated by, 'won' by, those who [see no problem with suffering.](https:\/\/www.cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/)(NSFL) This is evolution working 'as intended', if it had intentions. ). Cows are simply *unlucky* to exist in this universe, as are most human beings alive today. And the same would be true if cows could articulate thoughts like humans and become Stoics. This meme would *seem* helpful, but it's essentially an additional layer of slavery. The average human is just another kind of cow, just with extra tricks. Wishful thinking, self deception, the existence of propaganda and indoctrination, the existence of anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, etc. It can fight back a *tiny* bit better than a cow, *sometimes*. It has opposable thumbs, whichs helps with suicide, because a cow, if lucky enough to have the brain of a cow that realizes it's in cow hell, is forced to bash it's own brain against some metal railing to end it's misery. So... yeah, just cows in cubicles who can fool themselves that they're happy or forget where they are.

It ignores something important about reality. It's true that beliefs by\/about us can literally [manifest into success](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pygmalion_effect), but I don't think this is the world we really *want* to live in-- and it's unfortunate because many of us are simultaneously biased against realizing this value failure in the first place. It's biases scaffolding *other* biases, that's how crazy this whole \"making sense\" thing is. We want a world where life isn't a self-deception\/mass-deception game, we want it to be able to get as close as possible to reality, even if that reality is bad. Even**really** bad. \n\nI'm more or less convinced this is true, but it is also a value judgement. Some people will *intentionally* eat the fake steak because of some rationalization like, \"experience is still experience, so who cares?\" or \"Well maybe we can eat real steak someday if we just delude ourselves with some fake steak\". People who subscribe to this simply put extra value on pragmatism even if it's harmful to appreciating reality. Others would say \"Well wouldn't it be more useful if we could first be in touch with reality, and *then* decide to take our placebo? Could we sit down, reboot, evaluate what we are first? What this experience is, rather than resort to the sugar pill?\" It's funny how one make being in touch with reality like \"the obviously insane thing to value\" if we frame things just right -- that should be a very important clue about the sort of world we live in.\n\nI think my core disagreement is that what we lose by deceiving ourselves (Whether by rituals, religion, actual placebos, antidepressants, unconscious self-deceptions).

Simply re-read your post and evaluate it under the assumption that a cow is saying what you're saying to another cow in such a hell. Specifically:\n\n&gt;\"The things we are complaining about are what got us here so to an extent, the complaining isn't always a productive thing to do. It is at least presumptuous to think we know better than the Universe does. Don't get me wrong - \"complaining fixes everything\" - there's no progress in anything without identifying that which may be unproved. \"\n\nFrom our perspective, the cows in cow hell should simply blow their brains out. If they had opposable thumbs and access to veterinary barbiturates, it seems like an ethical emergency, if one was a cow, to get all the cows(in factory farms at minimum) to converge on mass suicide. Waiting around for humans to rescue them seems foolish, and cows will never outpace their human masters-- the lead gained by the feedback loop of power and dominance is simply too great. They don't have *time* to evolve opposable thumbs and discover chemistry. If they could, it would be wise to self-destruct rather than continue the \"cow hell project\" which was forced upon them. We can see this, from a human eye view. But the cows can't, so their fate is in our hands instead.\n\nNotice how we can add endless layers of bias here, wishful thinking, optimism bias, status quo bias, to create a complex web of hallucinations that make *most* cows believe that cow hell is worth continuing to further complicate and doom these animals even when self-deliverance is in their grasp. Reasons are given like \"Well, you know, things are slowly improving.\" or \"Who knows what'll happen in the future, the possibilities for positive outcomes are vast.\"\n\nNotice how insane it'd be if the cows living in the happier farming scenarios, gave this sort of reasoning to the cows in the bleak torture dungeons you see in documentaries like Dominion. Obviously we can beat around the bush until the ...

Louis C.K. said it best - everything is amazing and nobody is happy. \n\nI'd admonish you here to speak for yourself because to say \"everything is amazing\" is to be completely detached from the rampant misery on Earth, but even that seems flimsy given that the claim is optimism, which is not simply an opposing flavor of pessimism, but asynchronous in how likely it is that it tracks reality. We call the truth \"bitter\" or \"harsh\" or other negative descriptions. We rarely say something analogous to \"The joyful truth\". This may seem tempting to dismiss because 'what we say' doesn't seem to necessarily tell us facts about reality, but I think it's an important hint. Optimism bias actually has a survival advantage, it's a 'favored bias' here. Pessimism bias on the other hand, we should expect to select poorly if reality is darker than we tend to conclude. There's no blissful realism or hopeful realism, but there's depressive realism - the idea that depressed individuals see reality closer to what it is than those who are not depressed. This is somewhat contested as an idea but conceivable.\n\n&gt;The way to win the dominance game is to simply refuse to play. It just works. Stick to the facts. If people refuse to listen, shrug and move on. You don't have to fix them. You just have to put what you can in the hat to help, when you can. \n\nThis doesn't work as long as skilled cheaters(people pretending to not play the dominance game, but actually are) exist, and incentives for cheating exist. We're not moral animals, and natural selection will always select cheaters over rule-abiders. The \"rule-abiding\" you see today is simply a superficial product of domination - it benefits the ultimate dominators to shape reality this way. They *rode* this system of rules to the top by exploiting it, so rule systems will always exist and give rule-abiders the illusion that there's hope, while giving cheaters a natural obstacle course to compete as to who will most successfully jump through the hoops and avoid the booby trap rules - this is the most adaptive \"winner\" as far as natural selection is concerned.\n\n&gt;From \"Moloch\" :There\u2019s a passage in the Principia Discordia where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. \u201cEveryone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.\u201d\n\n&gt;The Goddess answers: \u201cWhat is the matter with that, if it\u2019s what you want to do?\u201d\n\n&gt;Malaclypse: \u201cBut nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!\u201d\n\n&gt;Goddess: \u201cOh. Well, then stop.\u201d\n\nI'd think this Goddess appears to be taunting 'Malaclypse' here because you never really overcome a prisoner's dilemma. Even *understanding* the prisoner's dilemma doesn't help, because it just adds more layers of meta-game. There's no game concept which doesn't ultimately reward the most *skilled* player and cheater rather than the most skilled player, and being a skilled player often overlaps heavily with being a skilled cheater(Case in point: any prodigy athlete in a team sport), therefore that's what we should *expect* has won both history, and the present, and the future.

It's simple enough to also simply demonstrate what's wrong with it.\n\nYou're missing some crucial pieces here, the first of which is, you've demonstrated the psychological toll of seeing the world as bad, in *one* direction, but not the other. You say someone who sees the bad, develops a bias towards bad, but you don't also take into account that someone who sees the good, is blinded towards the bad. This is the first crucial problem and the reason why conversations about the moral nature of reality is a struggle.\n\nSo, the person enjoying life says to the person who says it's miserable: \"You're just *depressed*. The person who says life is bad, says to the person enjoying life: \"You're just drunk on a good life.\"\n\nSome people see this first problem and intuit: \"Oh well, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, this *evens* out. These are mutually cancelling perspectives.\"\n\nI *suspect* you have this intuition, based on the parameters of your abstract example: 50% good lives, 50% bad lives.\n\nI would modify these numbers and say even a 75\/25 split is not worth living in, but we're very far from those numbers. How could that be? It's simply because the *character of experience* of having a good life and a bad life do not transmute in the same way once you take a holistic account of reality. What I mean by this is, imagine you're in the *worst* case scenario on Earth right now. I'd leave it up to your imagination, but because you seem to be arguing that life is good in general, permit me to stimulate you. Imagine you're unlucky enough to be [Junko Furuta](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Junko_Furuta). The first thing to note is, if your life has been particularly good, the *ability* to even imagine what this is like is impoverished. This is optimism bias, status quo bias, and endless other biases and aversions to even consider the idea \"Life *is* in fact hell and we don't realize it\". We are **allergic** to this very idea, when our lives are good.\n\nThe second thing to note is that if we were this person-- if we were beyond the stage of panic, fighting back, even beyond begging for death and simply existing as a mindless thrall to sadists, we would not be \"cheered up\" by the fact that someone out there is having the time of their life(pretend we could bypass the post-traumatic and coping mechanisms of the brain here to have a rational conversation). We could even be shown footage of a family frolicking in the meadows, perfectly beautiful and ecstatic people in peak human experience. Everything has gone *perfectly* for them. To call our aversion to this evidence an 'allergy' or a 'bias' seems highly suspect. It's missing something. It's not meaningful. If you were being tortured by having a small blowtorch applied strategically to your hands and feet right now, you simply wouldn't think this justifies the circumstances of the world you find yourself in, upon discovering that someone just had the **most** incredible, spiritual, peak human experience on MDMA, and it *wouldn't* be because **you** were missing something. You would be the unique owner of esoteric knowledge in such a scenario.\n\nNotice how this doesn't work the other way? Everything is instead going *amazing* for you, but suddenly you're shown livestream footage of the child that is being raped as I write this sentence, or the *other* child(sometimes the very same child, alas), that is being raped as you read this sentence **now**. This is totally jarring and really leaves a bad taste in the mouth, doesn't it? Only a psychopath or someone who is completely self-absorbed remains cheerful here and says, \"Oh well! You win some you lose some! Anywho, this is **amazing**, you've got to try this!\" The reason this asymmetry exists is simply because the esoteric knowledge of suffering, injustice, etc.-- all the bad things in life? These are *simply* not symmetrical nor can they \"even out\" the (also esoteric) knowledge of the good things in life, because bad makes a mockery of good in a way that good does not justify bad.\n\nAgain, these are not symmetrical perspectives. Having it bad is to be **more** in touch with reality than to have it good.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1563109305,"distinguished":null,"edited":1563137106,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"etr0zte","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ccagbm","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_etqd4oy","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/ccagbm\/a_view_into_other_worlds_youtube_videos_with_0\/etr0zte\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1571988355,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

And those who do not feel maximal empathy for a single person being tortured on the other side of the world are \"psychopathic\".\n\ntells me that you do not:\n\n&gt;now have an understanding of [my] position.\n\nI don't think it's controversial to say that not being in touch with reality is a perspectivally negative quality('winners' will disagree). I don't see how pointing this out is to be \"speaking of or treat slightingly; depreciating; belittling.\" I'm certainly not being *mean* here. I don't think you've captured what I'm doing or my motive when you say something like this. I'm also not even close to saying that one is a psychopath if they don't have maximized empathy, here I'm pretty sure you are in another galaxy as far as understanding what I mean when I use the word 'psychopathy'. What I am saying is that humanity in general is pretty delusional and psychotic when it comes to their own benevolence, and the benevolence of the world. I *am* calling homo sapiens a psychopathic and psychotic species, and their failure of empathy, penchant for sadism, domination, deception, manipulation, and charm is far greater than they realize. Your empathy doesn't need to fail once-- you will fail time and time and time again, and you won't **realize** it. You will sit there, dumbfounded, and then distract yourself and move on. The species is simply totally detached from both the reality around them, and the reality of their own psychology.\n\n&gt;You couple this with a belief that the world is a \"hellscape\" where the majority of people are miserable (Note that I don't think its nearly as bad as you believe it to be, but that's not really all that important). This, combined with the virtues of truth and empathy essentially creates a situation where misery is virtue and happiness is vice.\n\nRight, the majority of people are miserable and\/or distracted as far as I see. I'm trying to make sense of the second sentence and I just don't see how your head connects truth and empathy(which, I don't necessarily think is a virtue and I'm open to exceptions to truth being a virtue as well but it'll be a hard sell) leading to a scenario where misery is a virtue. Misery isn't a virtue, this is absurd. Misery *can* be a privileged position in that it is a state that aids in shattering a great hallucination taking hold of the species, if that clarification helps you, but there's nothing virtuous *about* misery itself. Misery on it's own is just awful luck. As for happiness being a vice, this is harder to clarify. Is happiness in a dystopia a vice? I'm not sure. It really depends on what we're talking about. Is shooting up heroin just so you can survive another day in Oceania a vice? I think so, but extreme hedonists may disagree. Is being an optimist in Oceania a vice? The word 'vice' doesn't quite capture the problem with optimism in Oceania. Oceania is a negative-sum game, and you should basically play it to end the game, not to *keep* playing it and hope it gets better when it contains variables that **ensure** a loss of the game. We run into the epistemic problem of never really knowing if the game is winnable, but I think if we accept scientific, objective rationality we should agree that you should treat reality as a solvable puzzle. Unfortunately, we don't have access to the best science in Oceania, so we're really just left with valuing rationality and similar modes.\n\n&gt;The ideal response when hearing about the torture of someone on the other side of the world is not to feel miserable but to feel compassion resulting in a desire to change the world to make similar situations less likely to occur in the future. \n\nAs an isolated case, I absolutely agree with you. In light of a history of sadism, deception and barbarism(those things we're allergic and blind to? that range of data that is robbed from our representation of the world?), in a system that favors the cleverest thug, absolutely not. You seem to be heavily invested in the idea of progress, when progress is actually regress if you're using any kind of ethical or truth based criteria. The winner of the game we're in, the \"leaderboard\", is filled with unethical actors, and this distills over time. We're in a game where the winners get to become administrators of the game, and unless you're totally naive, you'll see some conflict of interest here. Power feeds back into more power. Variation occurs, of course, due to entropy, but the requirements for winning against a simultaneously skilled player and skilled cheater(This is the leader at any given gamestate since playing the game in purely virtuous terms is effectively impossible in the long term), is to be an even more skilled player **and** skilled cheater. It's unlikely that Lionel Messi can beat Lionel Messi+(and effectively impossible in the **long** term, as heads beating tails+). 'Plus' here means a perfect clone with *added*: 1) Domination 2) Manipulation 3) Deception 4) Callous\/Lacking empathy 5) Charm, the rough phenotype of psychopathy. It's worth noting and perhaps having a chuckle at the fact that these traits *are* present in base Messi and what make someone an excellent athlete, because psychopathy is the de facto \"Winner\" phenotype in our world. This is why we are a psychopathic species, psychopathy has been distilled for millions of years of natural selection, and will continue to do so.\n\n&gt;You can call that \"psychopathic\" but all that means is that in this case \"psychopathy\" was the correct behavior, since it was the path of greatest wellbeing (and least suffering).\n\nWell it depends on what you mean by \"it was the path\". In deterministic terms, yes, the only way to win is to be a liar, sadist, charmer, dominator of others, etc. In purely conceptual terms this is the path to hell, which is inevitable in a world of a) self-replicators b) sufficient complexity resulting from time + entropy, which is our world. It's certainly not a path to greatest wellbeing in principle, but yes, many would dismiss that set of information as impossible in practice and therefore impossible in principle and not worth thinking about. I don't think this is worth dismissing. I think it's important to appreciate the idea of our world *not* being a meat grinder, and pinpointing the precise nature of our world. This is very hard to do without certain experience. To have a good life is to be unlucky here, and I've already explained in other posts how this bias doesn't go both ways.\n\n&gt;To me this seems pathological, it's a game where if you win you lose and if you lose you win. It reduces your adaptive fitness and makes you miserable in the process. Why would anyone play such a game?\n\nHere we agree completely. But it's not the view of the world that's pathological *if* this is the world we live in. I'm arguing that our universe **is** intrinsically pathological. This is not a controversial idea. All this means is the physicist saying euphemistically, \"The universe doesn't care about you\" or \"The universe is not \"meant\" to support life\". I would unequivocally just say: \"This is a [hellscape](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=985) and a [meat grinder](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=14)\".\n\nTo see hell as it is, is absolutely maladaptive-- here your observations are spot on. Why would anyone subject themselves to reality as it is? Well, there's a certain catharsis in it, but most people prefer to eat Matrix steak. I don't moralize these people, because for one, I certainly don't claim to be immune to matrix steak myself, and these are after all just apes who are wired for hedonism and an allergy to negative truth. If you mean \"why would anyone play this game\" in some grand sense, like \"Why should humanity continue to exist?\" then I would argue they would need a very compelling reason to continue this perverse project, but convergence here will almost certainly never happen since the winners are by definition highest in egocentrism, a property that dooms these winners to be losers in an ultimate sense(and dominate more 'losers'). This is the property of a negative-sum game.\n\n&gt;Empathy evolved to be a virtue in a world where most people lived in isolated, small communities, and in such a situation empathy would help bind these communities together and enhance their cooperation to avoid tragedy. But the world is not like that anymore, now we are connected to billions of other people whose lives we have no control over. There is no point in making yourself miserable over that which you have no control over, it only makes things worse.\n\nYes, empathy, like altruism, is best suited for small communities. This what I'd call \"winning in the short term\". In the big picture however, empathy and altruism are co-opted by psychopathy and added to a deception phenotype, the meaningful reason why they persist. Without altruism and empathy, a psychopathic actor would be robbed of moves in the game to dominate genuine empaths and altruists with. This is the same way essentially that cow phenotypes are co-opted by ape domination. Mammary glands benefit calfs, yes, but ultimately the beneficiary and the \"one in control\" of this phenomenon is the dominator. The disappearance of mammary glands would hurt calfs and the entire cow species, but the ultimate reason for their persistence has nothing to do with their benevolent utility to cows *anymore*, as it once did when cows were still \"winning in the short term\". Cows are now [losing in the long term](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3271), the vast majority of their species exists in cow hell. Such is the case with altruism and empathy. They \"stick around\" because it benefits a force sitting atop a pyramidal structure, not because there's some property in the universe that pushes \"good things\" forward. This creates the substrate for an illusion of progress, or an illusion of a non-Hell.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1563201651,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"etu1511","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ccagbm","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ett99hm","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/ccagbm\/a_view_into_other_worlds_youtube_videos_with_0\/etu1511\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1572057191,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

If we still partook in the old French past-time of [cat-burning](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cat-burning), this would be only somewhat distinct from a world where the violin was ubiquitous and only cat guts(ignore that strings being made from cat guts is a myth for the purpose of this hypothetical) would suffice, resulting in large scale imprisonment of cats in giant, dark, industrial facilities where cats were declawed, de-tailed, and de-whiskered, forcefully inseminated and turned into breeding instruments for the purpose of string-making, all without anesthetic and left to the carnage of piss, shit, and pain until outside luck ended their hell.\n\nBoth are cat-hells, but the only distinction is an overt sadism\/hell quality vs. an out-sourced sadism\/hell quality.\n\nWe outsource many things to psychopathic domination.

Cow Hell will be a thing of the past, lamentable in its past horror, but dead and gone nonetheless. \n\nNot worth it for the cow. If you're a cow, the ethical move is to press the red button on planet Earth. I'd argue the same seems to be true if you're a human, it's just less obvious for a human because they're not a cow. Failure to understand this is a failure to appreciate what it is like to be a cow, and to therefore accept the statements you've made on the topic in a context of systematic torture and brutality. The king says to the peasants, chin up lads. Don't worry. You won't need to be whipped for much longer. Those scars on your back that induce constant, ringing, searing agony even as you sleep on your straw beds? Soon a thing of the past. Soon a horror we will look back on and say, \"Never again.\"\n\nAll we need to do is endure until we defeat this other kingdom.\n\nThe problem here, is these peasants get crushed and enslaved by the King, the King and psychopathic memes proliferate, since they win history due to him resorting to \"win at all costs\". And then the peasant's children inherit a distilled psychopathy. Those who opt out or get crushed on principles, are gone. Their genes are dead, their memes are dead, or live on only as vestigial organs for psychopathic memes to employ where they are useful.\n\n&gt; If nothing else, the past couple centuries of scientific progress have shown that technology has the chance to temper malevolence and perhaps one day erase it for good. It will only survive inasmuch as it is a useful strategy for survival. When individual survival is no longer a pressing issue thanks to the marvels of the future, what need will humanity have for evil? What is greed when when everyone has everything? Why lie when all have access to the definite truth? \n\nI'd call this thought naive. It's purely an accident that scientific progress has created technology that tempers outright destruction(because everyone loses), but there's certainly no evidence it has tempered malevolence, which is quite different. Malevolence can operate in mostly non-violent contexts, and it does, because it's the ultimate adaptation insofar as it's masked(both internally, through self-deception, and externally through the phenotypes deception\/manipulation\/charm). The moment you get a powerful enough technology that disarms or removes an enemy with a significant enough upside to you and no downside to you, this technology will see play. This is simply obvious unless one is utterly drunk on some pro-human hallucination(Which is a common hallucination, unfortunately).\n\n&gt;All men sin. But I'd like to think we've come a long way and we have the idea of virtue and ethics to thank for that. Virtue alone has demonstrably improved the human condition, I'm not sure how it could be construed as enslaved to evil when it is by its very nature good. If virtue were gone from existence I don't think humanity would benefit from this tool of evil being suddenly erased. \n\nYeah, I'd like to point out the language here. You'd **like** to think. I don't read into this too heavily myself, but it's worth making a minor note of because it's a clue of the bias I'm talking about. I've already covered how virtue improved the human condition by accident(specifically, altruism, empathy, kindness, truth etc. -- all *more* useful to dominator Kings than to peasants just trying to make the world better). It's not *evil*, it's simply powerless *to* evil, and it *supports* evil. Re-read this quote: \"I'm not sure how it could be construed as enslaved to evil when it is by its very nature good.\" What about it's intrinsic good prevents it from being enslaved to evil? A cow can lick the wounds of another cow in the hopes it's kin heals(assuming in this hypothetical that cows have hopes), but this action is constrained in an Industrial factory farm where cows are quite literally in a hell *they* can't escape from as a result of their actions. All goodness does is make the hell less overt and more tolerable. It adds to order. If you could somehow teach cows English, and spread the meme of Stoicism or some sort of positive thinking, where cows now greet each other, like: \"Hey there Bessie! How's today treating you girl? No good as usual eh? Sometimes it be that way!\" while both cows are dying inside, then this would benefit cows only superficially. You'd call this empathy, good will, etc. But what this really does is it masks the hell the cow lives in. They could simply be saying: \"Bessie, look, we're fucking slaves. This is **insane**. This whole place is A FUCKING MEAT GRINDER AND ABATTOIR! THEY KEEP PUMPING ME WITH SEMEN AND EXTRACTING MILK... THE BLOOD... PISS.. SHIT.. PAIN... WHAT *IS* THIS HELL?!?!\" Of course, we also live as products of evolution, so shouting the truth like a lunatic, even if it's the truth-- even if shouting like a lunatic is an appropriate response to the insanity you're in, it's **maladaptive**. We're robbed of the appropriate response by sheer happenstance. \n\n&gt;You see virtue as a creature of Moloch, and I can understand why you'd think that. But my reckoning is that virtue is the antithesis of Moloch and that they are diametrically opposed. Without it, existence would be painful and futile indeed. But with it, we have something to strive for beyond Moloch. Even if virtue is as you say, his creature, his slave, it does not always have to be. .\n\nSomething like that, but not quite. If you want an abstract concept, virtue, ethics, and truth are like objects dangling from Moloch's fishing rod extended in front of humanity, which casts a shade to hide Moloch and his followers who walk at the end of line, while enticing every good intentioned person and victim of evil in front to pave the way for him with it's sweet aroma, aesthetic appeal, and a catchy jingle.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1563208853,"distinguished":null,"edited":1563210560,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"etubk3h","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cd5flm","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ett1y8i","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/cd5flm\/xi_jinping_in_translation_chinas_guiding_ideology\/etubk3h\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1572066203,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I can't say that I'm keeping a close eye on them, but from what I can tell it's not working very well for them.\n\nAh, I'm only vaguely familiar with E.Y., I've sort of skimmed Less Wrong for the first time in the past 6 or so months, but the only AI stuff I've been exposed to is Bostrom's book, and a few scattered youtube videos. Just looked up what SIAI\/MIRI is. I'm actually completely ignoring superintelligence, as far as my worldview goes. There's zero contingency of super-intelligence in my worldview, which I'll restate to you since I have not yet done so in plain language: psychopathy(Which I call the phenotype of domineering\/callous\/deceptive\/manipulative\/charming) is distilled in social systems across eons of evolutionary time, and this force gains a stronger and stronger grasp over social systems across this same stretch of time by ascending human hierarchy and creating greater and greater gaps in domination. Beating psychopathy is only possible by being a bigger psychopath, truth and ethics are lost because they are at the whims of apex psychopathy, and engaging in these strategies from a \"We can win\" point of view, is a losing strategy. The only viable strategy is damage control from here.\n\nThat's in the fewest words.\n\n&gt;The latter, probably. Because having virtues is good for you and for cooperating with other intelligences produces better results in the long term, while the decision to abandon virtues because it's no longer the long term would either be premature or not really matter.\n\nHaving virtues is bad for you though, because when you meet a scenario where your virtues conflict with the directive: Win, you are chained by your virtues where a party which is only operating on the directive: Win(This includes *pretending* to be virtuous , of course - the \"Deception\/Manipulation\/Charm\" cluster of the aforementioned phenotype), will defeat you if even you have some edge in playing the game skillfully. \n\nAlso, there's nothing preventing a cooperative scenario from being co-opted by manipulators. Example would be [the research](https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/613585\/prisoners-dilemma-shows-how-exploitation-is-a-basic-property-of-human-society\/) of Yuma Fujimoto and Kunihiko Kaneko at the university of Tokyo.\n\nCooperating produces superficially better results for you, but the **best** results for the most dominant player who abandons virtue.

That's not what I mean at all. I'm simply describing crying as a behavior in a ecosystem where there are monkeys who get sad, monkeys who console, and monkeys who get to be king, and also get to fake console, and this achieves 1) **All** monkey survival, but crucially, 2) King monkey survival. To fully understand what I mean when I say \"crying persists because it's beneficial to psychopaths\", you need to imagine a world where the most dominant monkeys instead see crying as some huge threat to survival. If **that's** the world monkeys live in, it does not matter the utility that crying has when two monkeys find each other, and one is sad, and the others mirror neurons also make it sad, and it helps the sad monkey and benefits from helping- **that** entire enterprise?

Why is this quote failing to take into account the death of a child, or any non-dominance context? This seems myopic to me. Anyway, I've read the article, since you insist. Very interesting, especially:\n\n&gt;Our ancestors faced a complex optimization problem: how to pursue, use, and exchange a variety of different resources (food, health, mates, allies, prestige, and dominance, among others) in an effort to maximize reproductive success, i.e., the number and success of one's offspring. Weeping (I contend) is the human organism's way of coordinating a difficult tradeoff between two of these resources. Specifically, it's a way of giving up dominance in the hope of earning allies. In other words, it's a gambit: a near-term sacrifice for a shot at eventual gain.\n\nand\n\n&gt;Once a signal evolves and becomes established within a population \u2014 enshrined as instincts in both senders and receivers \u2014 it will naturally be co-opted for other (related) purposes. \n\nGood stuff. I don't see how it poses a problem for what I'm claiming, however. \n\n&gt;If they are genuinely happy, then yes. They aren't happy though and I think that \"genuinely happy\" is a tautology of sorts.\n\nDidn't expect you to double down there. Are you saying that all happiness is valid **or** that one can't be happy in a horrific environment via total deception? In your view, is it not only unethical to liberate anyone happy in North Korea, even if they're brainwashed people who are psychologically damaged to enjoy being beaten daily, but it's unethical to even attempt to engage with a happy individual(suppose we could demonstrate they have no doubts about their happiness) manipulated in a dystopian hell? That would be a **serious** commitment to hedonism, unless I've misunderstood you. \n\nFollow-up question: Is it unethical in your view to convince a heroin junkie that their habit is not in their best interest for meaningfully tracking personal satisfaction with reality? Would you call this \"not genuine\" happiness? Or do you simply not care about how one's inner experience interfaces with reality? Is a mother who is experiencing peak ape bliss on MDMA while her child is being tortured and raped by a sadistic child rapist armed with sex toys and a blowtorch applied to the hands, feet and genitals(tangentially, notice how little you're bothered by living in a world where this is conceivable and it's unclear if this is fictional or true -- what is the difference here of this actually having happened to you, how would this alter your subjective experience\/outlook?), in the basement of the house next door, protected from your view? Is it also unethical in your view to say, \"Hey wake up dummy. You're *missing* something crucial, happiness isn't the most critical thing there is!\" even after she shoos you away for interrupting her ecstasy? \n\nSuper curious to get your feedback on these hypotheticals.\n\n&gt;For all your talk about psychopaths pretending to be nice people and unhappy people deluding themselves that they are happy and the Matrix and all that KINGDOM OF LIES you're unusually reluctant to explain what your freaking special plan for this world actually is.\n\nThe plan is to value the truth of reality, no matter how bitter and jarring that truth is. Deceiving ourselves is a path to hell. Beyond that, brainstorm? I don't claim to have plan because I **don't**. I'm simply expressing what I believe is the state of reality. What would your plan be, if this were an obfuscated hell? Enjoy the ride? I am skeptical, and I assume that's a perspectival bias and failure of the imagination to *truly* know how unsettling it would be to acknowledge that you're in **hell**. You're a guy that doesn't believe he's in hell, shrugging his shoulders. This is quite different from the experience of knowing you're in hell. Psychedelics can sometimes be an incredible stimulant of the imagination for this purpose, if one is lucky in the sense of esoteric knowledge, and unlucky in the context of experiencing a rock bottom negative hedonic state.\n\n&gt;I'm very straightforward about mine: let's kill all unhappy people or convince them to kill themselves in a painless manner.\n\nSince I don't have a clear plan, allow me to criticize yours, or at minimum point out that your plan doesn't involve hoping the confused people out there converge on your own optimistic and positive philosophical outlook. Rather, just kill them. Execute them maybe? Encourage their suicide? This is fascinating to me. Notice the difference between encouraging someone to change their mind about the most important question in reality rather than simply executing them or encouraging them to die. This should be a crucial, self-awareness inducing hint, unless a specific survival-optimizing phenotype is operative.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1563235406,"distinguished":null,"edited":1563235610,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"etvhbot","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cck0gt","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_etvcjba","permalink":"\/r\/TheMotte\/comments\/cck0gt\/is_your_ideology_below_the_sanity_waterline\/etvhbot\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1572105015,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TheMotte","subreddit_id":"t5_vkedk","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TheMotte","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

How could this *possibly* be helpful you ask? Well, look at lying. Lying to others is beneficial, unless you get caught. Then it's bad. But what if there was a trick to maximize the effectiveness of your lies? This is the adaptation of self-deception, lying to yourself in order to tell more convincing lies. Likewise, the more generic idea of psychosis, as in, 'hallucinating', is another adaptation. Those who assume the rustle in the grass is a tiger, live to reproduce. **Even** if it's just the wind. This is how paranoia gets favorably selected. Have you ever seen a squirrel in nature? It's *constantly* paranoid. \"Is that a hawk? WAS THAT A FUCKING HAWK? Oh. No. It was nothing. Oh look a nut- WAIT WAS THAT A FUCKING HAWK?!?!?!?!?\" Some would say, \"This is rational, not paranoia.\" However, I'd argue paranoia in our world, given the insane obfuscatory psychosis\/psychopathy hierarchy where greater and greater manifestations of domination psychopathy rule over everything, can be rational in the same way. Paranoia however is socially taboo. This is like the Tigers running a squirrel slave camp, and then telling the squirrels to stop being paranoid, everything is under control.\n\nWe are functionally psychotic at all times, totally detached from the reality of hell in our world because it benefits us to be detached, and benefits the winners of reality for us to be detached.\n\n* Psychopathy: \n\nThe way to understand this is, simply imagine your favorite player in a game or sport. Think of the **best** player you can. Now imagine a player *identical* to this player, but with the **addition** of: callousness, domineering, manipulation, deception, charm(the 'skillset' of Psychopathy). This new \"Best Player+\" just *smashes* the vanilla version, right? If you run the experiment 1,000,000 times, the odds of the vanilla player winning are extremely low. The 'plus' version is a better cheater. They care less about ethics. They are better liars. They are better at faking their actions. They are better at having a powerful drive to win the game. They are better at pretending to be the equal of this player and exhibiting very compelling displays of 'sportsmanship' and 'humility'. They are strictly **better** players, and therefore better winners.\n\nThis is the reason why Earth is an absurd, alien, backwards world where right is wrong and wrong is right. Because wrong wins. Lying wins. Telling the story of religions and ethics to dominate everyone, wins. Indoctrinating children wins. Being delusional wins.

Sometimes people get ripped off and think it's a great deal. Truth(A complete mathematics that makes sense), is the antidote to this. You'd need to apply the \"mathematics\" of injustice itself to this math analogy, in order for \"But then what's stopping us from using the truth of math for evil?\". The answer is, the 'math' of justice is what's 'stopping' it, if we could only know this truth. It's simply an information processing problem. This is why we should value accurate information.\n\n&gt;When we have people who buy few moments of bliss at the cost of potentially much more enjoyment for the rest of their lives, I'm with you. Add hypothetical selves that would be horrified by getting reduced to mindless hedonium, too, I guess. But if we go further to discussing a person whose tooth is supposed to be in pain but the nerve is anesthetized, I'm beginning to have my doubts about the fact that he is \"really\" in pain and that anesthesia is cheating and should be removed.\n\nI'm not sure what to do to that analogy to make it represent what I'm saying. Perhaps... that the pain is caused by a sadist using a cloaking device, and you *want* to know that a cloaked sadist is capable of hacking your nervous system. He doesn't seem to be bothering you now, if he exists, but what could he potentially do? Should we know about this cloaked sadist, or should we be ignorant about this property of reality?. Unfortunately, many of us have **no choice** but to be ignorant, due to the 'adaptation' that numbs us instead of alerting us to at least the clue of the sadist(Medical tests show zero reason why the nerves should be acting up, what a mystery!), because you're wired to survive, but **not** wired to be in touch with the reality of the horror show you exist in, where, if you only knew, you'd devote all of your resources to purging the invisible sadist simply because it's a bad strategy to let invisible sadists operate in the same gamespace as you are -- they ruin it for **everyone** by conquering the territory of the game. If this analogy doesn't at least make you wonder about our poor position to value truths about reality which we *would* value if we could only pay closer attention, then I don't know what else to say.\n\n&gt;When you say that valuing the truth of reality is good, I'm not sure why, does that make some deity happy while deceiving ourselves makes it feel pain? How do you even justify such assertions without sneakily reducing them to actually existing pleasure and pain in the first kind of examples? If deceiving ourselves is like shooting heroin then the hell is premature death and it's rational to want to avoid it, but you also seem to argue for a much more abstract version of hell that is the absence of understanding the truth of reality, and why is that bad?\n\nI already answered this in regards to injustice. If one doesn't have a brain that has the capacity to care about children and adults of all species geting raped and eaten alive in a giant meat grinder, then I can't magically manifest it in them.

Would you call it a kind of 'distracted auto-pilot'?\n\nAre you just swept up in the storm of emotions, and physics pulling your body along as some tiny glimmer of self-awareness in you looks on in horror, powerless?\n\nThat tiny glimmer is called mindfulness. And there's very good news. You can **train** this.\n\nI have a really silly analogy for you to express an equally silly idea because its so simple, but drives the point home -- bear with me please:\n\nImagine we lived in a completely foreign world. It's very similar; there are still people who feel sad, angry, ashamed, happy, anxious, etc-- but it's different in that in *this world*, there are *nothing* but cliffs. Steep, vertical cliffs. And we do, our *entire* lives, is climb these cliffs, socially. Sometimes alone, but often with people, cooperating to climb these cliffs.\n\nImagine someone in this world finally broke down with total frustration and panic and grief because their friend was injured due to them *again*:\n\n\"I just cant *take* it anymore! I was holding the rope for my friend, but it was too heavy to hold onto and then they slipped and fell! I want to die. I want to just tell my friend we're done, because I can't hold their rope. It's just a mathematical *fact*, I just can't hold it. Normal people can hold ropes, but *I* can't. I want to crawl in a hole and **die**.\"\n\nNow, this is a world where... upper body strength exercises are *barely* known, kind of a secret. Maybe some people heard of them before, but almost no one really does it, and it's kind of a taboo to suggest to others to do it. The strength they express in their social cliff-scaling is purely developed through life, and some people just have *less* for whatever reason. But how amazing would it be, how *happy* would this frustrated person be, if **all** it took to make themselves and others happier and less stressed, was a few minutes of training per day until the rope was *tough* but manageable. With enough training, the rope becomes *effortless* to hold, it really is a matter of **just doing it**. This is just... the best news ever, no?\n\nThat's exactly what is true for you **right now**. All you have to do is train your attention. Train that tiny part of you that *stops* impulse and being lost in emotions. It'll be *very* challenging, but the *method* itself is easy-- like any exercise. \"Just pick up the weight, and put it back down\". Totally straightforward. If you do this over and over and over, you get **strong**.\n\nWith attention , all you do is sit back, relax, close your eyes, and observe your breath go in and out. That's it. Thoughts come to mind?

Certain things are *simply* maladaptive. It is worth mentioning that lots of things that appear maladaptive at first are actually adaptive of course(and our intuitions on what is adaptive is often dead wrong and an awful winning strategy), but we also have to admit that certain behaviors go *against* what is beneficial for the genes, while also aligning with a different value system, like ethics, or truth. The confusion here is that *signaling* that you align with ethics and truth is adaptive, but **aligning** with ethics and truth genuinely is not. We have this dense mythology of heroism and tales and marvel movies and Disney cartoons to tell us otherwise, but these are fictional stories that conflict with what actually wins evolutionarily. Great white sharks win. Lions win. Psychopathic monkeys win. This is a **huge** bullseye, if, once understood, reveals the rest of the idea I present.\n\nThe way the world appears to me at the moment is that things which are **most** adaptive, are also often the **least** ethical. The sight before me is that of a giant meat grinder which creates gradations of illusion depending on who you are, that it *isn't* a meat grinder, but rather a beautiful mystery. How could the meat-grinderyness of the universe be genuine, while the beautiful mystery is illusory? It's simply because our interpretation of these things is **ruined** in a one way direction, under the **condition** that one has the firmware to detect ethics. If we don't agree here that a psychopath simply is in a poor position to evaluate ethics, we've reached an epistemic dead end. If this isn't too controversial, then onwards. \n\nFrom here all we need to acknowledge is a consciousness capable of processing ethical questions will have their hedonism ruined, even if deeply meaningful, by the reminder that they live in a hellscape. I need not link more NSFL links, you can find them littered through my post history. The world is a massive coverup of depravity, hiding behind status quo's, norms, households, and endless layers of dishonest systems which promote bad behavior while pretending to stamp it out. This is simply because **good** bad behavior is **good**. Being a **phenomenal** liar who can convince everyone is thumbs up, being a child rapist who is so powerful and crafty they **never** get caught is rewarded by the system because the rules are an obstacle course to be beaten by the right adaptations, is a-okay. Being someone who loses their cool and kills everyone with a chainsaw, not so much. This is too 'honest' for us to reward. This is the game working as 'intended'.\n\nBack to profound hedonic experience. Once someone in such a state is *reminded*(they must be reminded after all, to be absorbed in this moment is by *definition* to forget that a child is being raped **right now**(again, notice how this realization is ephemeral and just slips away into nothingness... this child is **real**. Once more, the words bounce off.)\n\nBut if the depraved reality is **forced** onto the individual in hedonic rapture, it *spoils* the show. It simply makes the meal unenjoyable. We *lose* our appetite.\n\nAgain, notice the counter-example. You're an unlucky individual. Like **really** unlucky. You'll have to use your imagination here most likely, which may not be sufficient simply because we're on opposing sides of this argument-- if you understood extreme misery on a deep level this wouldn't be a challenge to express(the great predicament and burden of our perspectival bias). Try your best to imagine extreme torture, the kind that doesn't end soon. You're begging for years, it just doesn't stop. You're a victim of the deeply mentally ill. Not even a person worth hating, if you're committed to truth and reject the monkey adaptation of making an enemy of the Pain Lords. It's all just confusion. There's not even any sense to it, it's just absurd sadism and insanity. A true meat grinder, in the slowest of motions. Ah, but! A silver lining!\n\nAlways look to the bright side of life, someone tells you. They whistle along to Monty Python. They show you others, somewhere far away, live footage of their bliss. Genuine bliss, not materialistic garbage. Spiritual epiphany... yet... here comes the torturer again... \n\nThe footage plays on. It's ... just... not helping? Is it making it worse? It's making it *worse*.\n\nIt's just *not* symmetrical at the level of experience.

What's the less extreme form? It seems like a jump because you're saying \"could even be\". What's the more default expectation?\n\nRight well, that's a super premature idea if one is skeptical that there's even a problem. You can safely ignore it for now in the same way you ignore any other \"*could* be\". I'm not very skeptical about this place being a meat grinder, and I've outlined what produces the illusion that it is not. This is really the best I can do for now, and this is all *after* my own bombardments on this representation of the world, after applications of Occam's razor, after rationality axioms, etc. The 'plot twist' of reality is not positive, is my conclusion. We can admit why we'd be led to believe it is, by simply imagining the utility of making cows in cow hell who were at risk of destabilizing our domination of them(Maybe they had opposable thumbs and higher cognitive ability), believe that either existence was good, or benign\/neutral. Just imagine 3\/4ths of the animals living in darkness, piss, shit, and pain right now, capable of doing philosophy, believing in moral nihilism. Sure would help their sanity, but it would also be a neato way to pacify them as the sentient punching bags they are(Notice how little sleep is lost - monkey brain working as intended). \n\n&gt;I feel like you covered this already but I'm not recalling it. What keeps this from being realized normally? Is it that it optimizes gene survival to take the endogenous, feel-good drugs that blind you to the hellscape?\n\nWell, many things. And there's an internal&lt;-&gt;internal feedback, and an external&lt;-&gt;internal feedback, here, but optimism bias is an adaptive behavior, while pessimism is maladaptive. \"This is an unwinnable hell\" is possibly one of the *least* sexy ideas one can express, as any adult knows from either of two angles. There many more effects, like the [Pygmalion effect](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Pygmalion_effect). If you believe things are going great, or if *others* believe you're great, this manifests itself in ways that solidify the illusion to become even more powerful. Skepticism of happiness or goodness is a poor strategy, it causes one to dig in the mud until they dig deep enough to discover and endless cesspool of feces. And then no one wants to associate or mate with that, now do they? Bad mojo. Bad for survival, even if true. \n\nWe're left to sublimate these the horrors of reality in art and other expressions, like prisoners in a classic sci-fi dystopia who can only communicate with 'an uncanny gaze caught in a moment of eye contact'.\n\nPersonally, I'd rather dig in the shit to be in a better position to ask, \"What should we do about all of this shit\"? than smell the artificial roses, especially since things suffocate in agony in this shit endlessly through spacetime.

Even if you did actually compete with your psychopathic clones, the handicap would only result in the lowered probability of your victory, as opposed to setting it to literally zero. The second-best tennis player in the world wouldn't lose to the best tennis player in the world 100 out of 100 matches; hell even 1000-th best player would be likely to get one or two victories out of a hundred.\n\nI don't really understand some of the language you're using, like \"clones\", but after reading over what you've written you seem to essentially be saying: \"You can win in the short term\"\n\nThat's uncontroversial to me. I'm looking at the biggest possible picture here, not the short term. To illustrate what I mean, imagine an earlier time in human evolution. Imagine a world where monkeys coalesced to form an isolated society where it was *just* about ethics and honesty. The society tried to bend over backwards just to fix all the injustice that the entropy of living on Earth caused. There was never any hatred. Never any ill will. Never any manipulation. Always a selfless, highly concerned attitude for your fellow because we all agreed that existing in this sort of society minimized suffering.\n\nThat's all compatible with my view, because it's the short term. It's the result of your \"100 matches\". My view however, encompasses something more like a googolplex of matches across the totality of spacetime. **Here** you cannot win. The tribe above can function, only until they meet a group of players who simply don't *value* these rules. How does their competition against each other unfold? Well, let's set aside the easy example where cannibal gorilla-men descend on the most benevolent apes who have ever lived, rape the women, kill the men and children, and dine on monkey flesh for the next few days(Which reliably can be said to exist in the non-fiction category of Earth's history, by the way).\n\nLet's say good guys have guns, and bad guys have guns. Is this a fair fight? No. The good guys *still* lose even when you give them equal technology, because the phenotype of being an organic domination robot, simply defeats a benevolence and truth robot. The good guys are at a disadvantage: They **feel** bad as a result of what the genes expressed. They could say something like \"Well.. these people are just unlucky for being wrong.\"(True)\n\nBut the other set of brains are just purely egoic, exerting their will and domination with a vigor that can't be matched, because their operating system says: CONQUER AT ALL COSTS. Their phenotype exists as a *perfection* of the strategy: Domination. Use **any** trick in the book, what wins gets the green light.\n\nIf it boils down to it, if the only strategy is laying down your arms as the evil tribe, and approaching the good guys with a false truce, and then butchering everyone at night, **that's** the strategy. That strategy is simply not easily exercised by the good tribe. Over large spans of evolutionary time, **evil** wins over good.\n\n**Even** when you skew things in the favor of the good guys in terms of technology, take away the guns of the bad guys, leave them with bronze age tools, and given enough time of domination distillation, their offspring **will** destroy the benevolence and truth maximizers. You just **cannot** win, given enough time.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1563491729,"distinguished":null,"edited":1563492347,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eu644e7","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cck0gt","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eu58kpb","permalink":"\/r\/TheMotte\/comments\/cck0gt\/is_your_ideology_below_the_sanity_waterline\/eu644e7\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1572381029,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TheMotte","subreddit_id":"t5_vkedk","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TheMotte","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

It's just like any other psychopathology -- take paranoid schizophrenia for example. How could this be prevalent at all? How could it be *beneficial* to be delusional? To hallucinate?\n\nLet's think about how humans evolved for a moment. If you saw a rustle in the grass as an ancient human ancestor, and you were inquisitive and skeptical, committed to the truth, but the rustle turned out to be a tiger-- you were lunch, and your children(if you had any) had lowered chance of survival.\n\nIf however you didn't care about the truth, but instead believed *every* rustle was a tiger, well, you had a 100% success rate at not dying to tigers -- a very powerful adaptation.\n\nThat's sort of what I think these 'disorders' are. Strategies that *sometimes* work. If you simply label things in two categories, \"Good\/Bad\", you can sometimes get by on this model. If you correctly label a thing that is bad, **as** bad, then this is reinforced as long as it promotes survival.\n\nUnfortunately, we're running on firmware that was developed over millions of years, and has bugs. Bugs that look like features, and features that look like bugs, and the line is blurry. The world has nuance, and isn't always black and white, but sometimes it is, so this is why this 'feature' exists.\n\nBut the benefit of looking at these disorders as \"strategies of varying success\" de-stigmatizes them. It's no longer some mysterious crazy thing. We're no longer ashamed of having schizophrenia, or BPD or whatever it is someone is diagnosed with -- instead it's *simply* a feature\/bug in the brain's ancient architecture. Take the scary mystery away, and you get understanding.

Mostly because they're forced to be, and can't make a bold prediction like this because they won't be taken seriously.\n\nRando dude on the internet however can say it rather plainly:\n\nThe world is completely under **control** of psychopathy, and humanity is a de facto **psychopathic** species. We are functionally psychopathic, because it benefits survival. The psychopaths killed off the non-psychopaths thousands of years ago. The sane apes died when they investigated rustling grasses, and died to lions, leaving psychotics who believed every rustle was a lion to populate the earth. The good, kind apes died when they were manipulated, enslaved, starved out, and killed by the psychopathic apes. All that are left are various degrees of pretender altruists and those who manipulate pretender altruists, by strategically defecting more for their own gains. These are the winners of reality.\n\nPsychopathy obfuscates this, both systematically in creating a propaganda world, to shroud the hellish condition of the world and internally(we self-deceive to more readily believe our own lies): \"Reality tells me things are going well!\" Meanwhile, life remains a horror show for the average human being, who doesn't get to participate in the conversation.\n\nVirtue and Truth cannot win in the game we're in, only Evil(Win at all costs) wins in this game. We're in a hostage situation from a prisoner's dilemma, as a result of what 'won' according to natural selection: Psychopathy and Psychosis.\n\nI don't expect anyone to subscribe to this view since it's essentially saying you're *in* the Matrix, sans pills.

This sort of goalpost moving, \"Short term could be 100 billion years, even!\" is not how you play the game honestly. Short spans of time really *are* short, and for every short span of time, there is a *long* span of time. If your short term is a billion years, my long term is a googolplex. You still dodge the problem of suffering in the *googolplex*. You don't just get to goodness and end it. You get to evil. And everything about reality right now is evil, and part of that evil is an obfuscation of and detachment to what *actually* [happens](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Junko_Furuta) in the world.\n\nAI singularity is co-opted by the evil dominance that has already won history through evil means. The same is true for genome modification. Who sits atop of Earth's hierarchy? Good guys, or bad guys?\n\n&gt;If not anything else, a millennia of the good life is a worthy goal by itself.\n\nStand alone, and out of context, perhaps. In the context of Junko Furuta's life? Not a chance. Double down and live her life first, *then* say your orgasm and Netflix shows and ice cream is worth it.\n\n&gt;One more thing to consider is that good\/bad is a spectrum. By your definitions I think I am some kind of a psychopath-lite, yet my morality still passes the Kantian Categorical Imperative test: if a world was filled by people like me, it would be a nice, cooperative, non-violent place worth living in. \n\nA few problems. One, this is your evaluation of yourself. While human beings as they are today can't ever escape bias, this is just about the most biased question you can possibly pose. My evaluation of you, if I could access a full account, would not be so charitable. Secondly, the moral framework you're using to evaluate yourself is the same framework which reduces to \"punching someone in the face to save a googolplex of tortured children is never acceptable\", a highly suspect framework. Kantian ethics are not to be taken seriously for this reason.\n\n&gt;Imagine another tribe that doesn't escalate conflict first, but always assumes the other side may choose to escalate and builds defenses accordingly, is ready to retaliate at the same level of escalation, doesn't accept surrender from known truce-breakers. Such a tribe would be able to coexist with the good-tribe, but the evil tribe would only get a slight advantage. It'd take a long long long long time before the domination distillation process by itself does anything here.\n\nSure, we can create this hypothetical. One side is maximizing offense, and another side maximizes defense. The toolkits, the phenotypes that evolve through an offensive strategy are asymmetrical with the phenotypes of defense. This is why \"offenders\" win history -- they have the advantage of being proactive. They invade a city, their military suffers problems, they subject themselves to natural selection, they are forced to learn, adapt, improve, or die. They are ultimately selected out or in -- selection occurs on *their* terms and is very high frequency, causing relatively fast gains.\n\nA defensive strategy however, is **only** tested when an offender decides to attack you. This is why turtles and armadillos are not apex predators, but whether you're talking about ocean or land, things which **crush** shells(Or invent the machete\/axe\/napalm\/fungicides\/antibiotics\/sterilization) are apex predators. \n\nThe sort of thought you're describing comes from the common but wrong intuition that two things that are seen as traditionally opposing polar forces, must be perfectly equal in some mathematical sense. But this is not the case. Good and Evil are not equals. Offense and Defense are not equals. Offense wins in the long stretch of time, which is why offenders dominate our world. Evil wins in the long stretch of time, which is why evil dominates our world. What is evil? Some ugly thing? Some overt thing? Of course not. Evil is simply a phenotype, three aspects of this phenotype are manipulation, deception, and charm(The others are domination, lack of empathy, self-absorption -- This isn't magic, this is psychopathy, an evolved set of traits.). Evil is inherently [camouflaged](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) and may seem aesthetically pleasing. Evil is sort of like a thing you can't see, but know is there, given the right calculations(Loosely like Dark matter in physics). If you stare at true evil, it'll look gorgeous, pleasant, uninteresting, or simply be invisible, but this is the adaptive traits at work. A world dominated by evil is a 'backwards world'.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1563548656,"distinguished":null,"edited":1563549747,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eu832mj","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cck0gt","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eu7929j","permalink":"\/r\/TheMotte\/comments\/cck0gt\/is_your_ideology_below_the_sanity_waterline\/eu832mj\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1572418033,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TheMotte","subreddit_id":"t5_vkedk","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TheMotte","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

It's easier to provoke someone to attack you than to defend yourself against the most sinister attacks. It's easier to commit an unwritten crime than to pass a law against the would-be criminal act. The bad actor has the edge, plain and simple. The bad actor maintains the illusion of progress with hedonic bones, thrown at the subservient slaves on the planet.

These are \"births which undo many more births\", and therefore undo suffering -- these births are ethical. The only sane strategy is to err on the side of caution and know that you will *not* damn anyone, or a lineage of 'anyone's', into this hell.

We realize we will die, and then we evolved a way to lie to ourselves about it.\n\nHe calls these \"[adaptive delusional systems](https:\/\/youtu.be\/HgfJoCNDjr8?t=1594)\". One of the main purposes of these systems are to sweep the reality of death under the rug. Tech religions, the singularity cult, transhumanism, these he identifies as a kind of cutting edge religion with a sticker on it that says \"New!\". The function of these religions is the same - to serve as an adaptive psychosis which lets us forget the reality that we will die, giving a strategic anxiolytic effect to anyone who believes. Just one of many powerful lies we evolved to tell ourselves, so we can better deceive others.\n\nJust lots of mentally ill adaptations on this planet. Mental illness thrives. Sanity is maladaptive. The irony here is our mental health industry, by these same terms, is a psychosis inducing industry. Imagine if you were being terrorized by a pack of tigers who never really ate you, just clawed at you every now and then. You'd be scared, your red alerts would go off, you'd panic, get angry, you'd **do** something about this threat, right? Imagine if an evolutionary adaptation occurred which made you **not** overcome the sadist tigers, but made you **less depressed** about the tigers. Less anxious. They clawed and hissed at you, and you shrugged. You stared at your torn skin, and shrugged. You didn't panic. You could just go to sleep to wake up the next morning and repeat the process all over.\n\n**This** is clearly insane. Sure, it helps you \"survive\", this isn't a way to live, is it? **You're getting clawed at by mentally ill tigers.** You're getting infections. You're not thriving, 33% of your kids get eaten by the tigers. And you just. Don't. Care.\n\nBecause you have an \"adaptation\". Is this any less mentally ill and psychotic than the ape who is a paranoid schizophrenic because it helps them survive by believing the grass rustling is an evil god, which *accidentally* gives them an advantage in avoiding tiger attacks? No, of course not. Both are *simply* adaptive psychosis, just like death-denial religions, whether you're talking about the old religions, or the new optimism cults.\n\nBut the mental illnesses above are no different from the mental illnesses in pill form, distributed like candy. This is precisely what the psychiatric industry does. It lets you \"survive\" another day, in hell. It's ironically a mental illness industry, just like religion. Both are extremely profitable. A worker who can wake up another day and walk to work in a hellscape of competing superpowers is extremely useful. This utility to the powerful are what fuels religion and psychiatry.\n\nI'll end with a quote from someone who's behavior and conclusions I don't endorse, but who understood deeply this specific problem in our world:\n\n&gt;\n\u201cImagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy then gives them the drugs to take away their unhappiness.

You were *thrown* into a situation, against your will. You consented to nothing. You signed up for nothing. You didn't pick your genes. You didn't pick your parents. You didn't pick your peer groups. Your teachers. Your **thoughts**. Your brain. You didn't **create** any of this. You were taught from a young age that the world is a good place. That you have to keep your chin up and work hard and stay positive and that you'll achieve anything. Cartoons and movies and myths and other stories paint a beautiful world... giving you hope and bombarding you with something that feels *not quite right* to you but you know what, maybe we're just crazy? Maybe we just have to open up and trust. Then all of this blows up and the insanity of the world smacks you like a ton of bricks.\n\n...at the same time...\n\nYou are *treated* as if this is all somehow on **you**. You are told it's your **fault**. Not only that, but you're **not allowed** to be mad. You're not **allowed** to express your emotions despite being tossed around like a ragdoll between abusive thoughts and abusive people, who are themselves ragdolled by abusive thoughts. This is an insane expectation of reality, plain and simple. This is how abusers treat victims.\n\nIs this the price for honesty? For not lying to yourself? For not eating up all the mythology and bullshit and Disney and Marvel movies and positive thinking? The show is spoiled once you see what's behind the curtain. And you see it in yourself, plainly, so you **know** what's inside others. You see the selfishness. The lying. The egomania. The narcissism. The delusions. The sociopathy.\n\nWhy? Why is the world like this? Simple evolution. We evolved to be two things, psychotic and psychopathic. What does this mean? Psychosis is delusion, it's a belief in something that is simply incoherent with reality. This is rampant. How come? How could evolution **reward** delusion? Isn't it that only **good** things get selected, and bad things don't? Delusions are **bad**, so what gives? Not as intuitive as it seems. It turns, out, evolution doesn't make sense. If you're a human ancestor on the plains of the Savannah, and you see a rustle in the grass and don't know what it is, and are skeptical and inquisitive and suspend belief, and it turns out to be the wind, you're okay. But if it turns out to be a tiger, you're **dead**. Out of the game. However, if you simply believe **all** rustles are tigers, or **all** rustles are the evil wind god, you avoid tiger death every time in this scenario. Slowly, over time, the world becomes filled with the delusional, and the sane die slowly die off. What about lying? The phenomenon of self-deception, where we lie **to ourselves**? This is the ultimate psychosis because we believe something we *know* isn't true -- how could *this* be good? Well, we're very good at reading social signals on faces. If you believe in your own lies, you have what's called an adaptation, something which helps you, even if it *seems* to hurt you, it improves survival, which is all that matters from the point of view of evolution. Features like these are what set the foundation for the second pillar of human insanity, psychopathy:\n\nPsychopathy is a set of attributes that are roughly composed of: Domineering, Lack of empathy, Self-absorption, Manipulation, Deception, Charm. It's a \"tool kit\" which lets you 'win the evolutionary game'. This is because playing by the rules is a worse strategy than being both good at the game **and** a really good cheater. This is what this toolkit achieves. It says: \"Win harder than everyone else, you're number one, don't care about anyone else ultimately, trick and lie to everyone in a way that completely convinces them, and then have this positive glow about you that manipulates people's emotions in a way that they *love* you while you're a monster. **That's** what psychopathy is, and we all evolved it to some degree, because it's \"the winning strategy\".

This is a tough one with no clear answers. The first thing to realize is this burden of the monkey brain we've been given. That voice, impulse, that goes \"Me hungry... me horny... me bored...\"\n\nTotally self-absorbed, totally egoic, the voice that so easily rationalizes dismissing or ruining the lives of others and then accepting none of the blame for the fallout. That's what humanity is up against. People will moralize you for what you've written even after you've shown to the decency to at least attempt to be self-aware here with your first sentence-- we are just not very charitable when it comes to these things. I'm writing all of this just to set the context of what's operating on all of our minds as a handicap. What is *covered* by this thin, brittle, superficial layer that we're indoctrinated with while growing up.\n\nThe only sane thing to do here is consider what this would be like from the perspective of everyone implicated. What would this be like for this boss? What would this be like for his wife? What would this be like for your husband? All while admitting that we're human, too-- what'll it be like for us?\n\nDoing this **honestly** is a real challenge, because we've got that rationalizing monkey brain that constantly steers us towards what we want, which is often opposed to what we *should* want, or *would* want, if we were simply more honest. \n\nVery often in life, it comes down to: Be an asshole and chase your happiness(potentially becoming miserable in the process), or be miserable and do the right thing. \n\nThere are still better and worse ways to handle it. One of these ways would be to be honest with your husband. You're in an open relationship, so they should know you've got the hots for your boss, right? There are two possibilities here. Either your relationship is not as open as you thought( something you'd **want** to know) or you'd be encouraged by someone who genuinely married you because he loves you and wants to best for you (something you'd **want** to know).\n\nIf it's the former, it does **not** mean your husband doesn't love you. It simply means there's clearly some misunderstanding about your open relationship.\n\nSecondly, if **you** were your husband in this position, and your wife was considering taking her boss up on flirting and possibly escalating your open relationship, you'd certainly want to have their confidence here and not do something like this behind their back. It's an open relationship, not a \"perpetual hook up with a room mate\". Unless it is. If that's the case, then I won't judge people here, just actions. So there's the breakdown, the choice is now yours to make. I think the healthiest move as far as coping is being honest about the details that are not just important to you, but *would* be important to you if you were one of the other 3 parties involved in this.\n\nHope things work out optimally for you, cheers.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1563580333,"distinguished":null,"edited":1563638938,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eu9h0l9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cfemxk","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_cfemxk","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/cfemxk\/unhealthy_crush_on_boss_tips_to_cope\/eu9h0l9\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1572443540,"score":4,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

The beneficiary of the happy ending myth is not the hopeful hero, it's the psychopath who is already in charge, and who will stay in charge, as the hero rolls his rock up the hill like Sisyphus and goes insane.

They're not stupid, there's a reason why they're insanely successful. In many ways they're far far smarter than us. But the perspective of a miserable existence is simply esoteric knowledge. You can't have the kind of life Warren Buffet has and at the same time be truly able to connect with the worst misery on the planet. The phenotype of the \"game winner\" simply can never understand the \"game loser\", because to be a winner you need extreme rationalizations and selective empathy. You can't become say, the CEO of Apple while truly and deeply caring for the suffering of all sentient life. It's just like a Great White Shark becoming the Dalai Lama. It's just *incompatible*.\n\nSomeone critically minded can argue here: \"Well doesn't it work the other way around too? That a quadriplegic suffering in the slums of Mumbai can't understand how incredible life is for Bill Gates?\"\n\nYes and no. It's simply not symmetrical. People have this bias that the world is in some kind of perfect balance and order. Yin and Yang. Good and evil. Offense and defense. And each is a perfectly calibrated force of nature, to deal with the other. But this is simply not the universe we live in. It's easier to be evil than good, because it's easier to break than to fix. To lie than to repair a lie. To commit a horrible act which is not a crime but should be, than to make a new law. The reason for this feature of our universe is entropy, which is simply the natural property of the universe that goes from order-&gt;disorder. \n\nWhat does this have to do with our experience? The way we experience positive and negative is **not** symmetrical because entropy is an asymmetry engine. Imagine Bill Gates on his best day. Just pure joy. On top of the world. Maximum winning. What a blessing. Spiritual bliss and ecstasy. And... now he's shown a video of the worst misery. Maybe even a live video, of a child rape, like the one which occurs at the moment of me writing this sentence, and another that occurs as you read this sentence. This *ruins* the Bill Gates's experience if he is mentally healthy and ethical. If he's a psychopath he won't care(But will pretend to care). But if he's ethical, his perfect day is *ruined*.\n\nCompare this to the quadriplegic in Mumbai, on *their* worst day. True misery. Stepped on all of their life. Not allowed to feel and experience in even the most basic human behaviors. They will never feel love. Never feel passion. Never feel joy. They are a factory of pure physical and psychological pain, shit, and piss. Nothing more. True and sheer hell. On their worst day, if they are shown Bill Gates's *best* day... what does this do? Does this change their experience in the same way Bill Gates's best day is ruined? Of course not. They don't suddenly say, \"Oh okaaaaay! I was simply lacking in perspective.. ahh! This is all worth it now because Bill Gates is so successful and overjoyed.\"\n\n\nThis is the asymmetry in action, and why the perspectives of the worst sufferers and **more** meaningful than those who are experiencing the greatest success and bliss. Yet our world is perversely calibrated, where the 'rulers' and 'winners' of the planet get to order that we continue to play this game. The loser has no voice. The loser is a slave. This is why reality on an entropy gradient, with self replicating sentient systems is the definition of hell.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1563648592,"distinguished":null,"edited":1563649242,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eubi38x","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cflydy","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_euavww7","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/cflydy\/how_would_antinatalists_rebut_this_position\/eubi38x\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1572482299,"score":8,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I fondly recall my \"best\" job, an organic supermarket in my early 20's. Management was incredibly lax, the workers were a close knit group of friends, and most simply stole what they wanted to various degrees because it was minimum wage and that's just what happens when you make monkeys play a Stanford prison experiment. I was a fairly serious offender here. Never received a raise, despite being praised as a good employee(7.50 an hour). We all 'made' our raises one way or another. You'd give the deli guy a huge discount, and then when it came time to lunch, you ordered a sandwich from him and he threw in like 35 dollars of luxury ingredients to you. This was essentially underpaid poor warfare versus the lax rich elite ownership who enjoyed their cash cow. \n\nThe music was... not as terrible as most places, but the same songs. I still have a visceral reaction of disgust to Journey - Don't Stop Believin'. I think this played on a daily basis.\n\nBut the funniest memory, and what made the constant repetitive music bearable, was the fortune of having close friends. There was a song in Spanish that came on a lot, or perhaps Portuguese? I can't remember the words, but it was sung in a very soft, romantic tone with a bit of guitar or something in the back. We spoke Polish here though, and one repeated verse sounded just like \n\n\"Yoouuu sicckkk cunnnnt\"\n\nIn Polish, but in a soft and romantic tone. So it'd always be, \"Oh nice, I can't wait for 'Sick Cunt' to come on today.\" It's the little things in life like this that bring you joy. You may not be as lucky in your job, but if it helps you stay sane, you can pretend you belong to an isolated and scattered community of wage slaves out there, that *would* express inside jokes with you and maybe make you a nice sandwich every now and then, even though it'd get them fired to do so. If it were up to me, I'd make you that sandwich because you deserve it. Why, you ask? It's like that line from Network...\n\n\"You're a human being **god dammit**!\"\n\n\"**YOUR. LIFE. HAS.

The fundamental error everyone who isn't currently *panicking* about the nature of our reality makes, is the following question:\n\n\"What does **evil** look like?\"\n\nRead the above question again. And again. Never stop asking it. I think if one doesn't understand evil, then one is doomed to misunderstand the prognosis for humanity, and for any social system in a universe with the two properties:\n\n* Trending entropy gradient\n* Competing self replicators\n\nThe first thing to realize is, we are victims right now. We are victims of propaganda. The propaganda I'm talking about is all the media you've consumed in your life. All the mythology. All the ideology.\n\nWhat is the common theme for all of this media? A picture of good and evil. What does this picture say? It says:\n\n* Evil **looks** ... straightforwardly evil. Evil is dark, nasty, scary, monstrous, menacing, disgusting, mysterious.\n* Good **looks** ... straightforwardly good. Good is light, kind, benevolent, angelic, friendly, pleasant, familiar.\n* Good ultimately defeats evil.\n* The ending of the story is just and good.\n\n\nReady for the plot twist? Ready for the proverbial bitter pill? Here goes:\n\n**All of this mythology, from David and Goliath, to Christianity, to Marvel comics\/movies which flood our consciousness, from Star Wars, to Game of Thrones, to Hollywood movies**\n\n... Is **evil** incarnate. This is a **cartoon** version of good and evil. Good and evil doesn't work this way, as expressed in our kind of universe. In our universe it's *precisely* the opposite. Why? How?\n\nYou have to understand the three obfuscatory pillars of psychopathy, to truly understand evil. They are:\n\n* Deception\n* Manipulation\n* Charm\n\nThese three features obfuscate the other 3, Self-absorption, Domination and Callousness.\n\nWhen you 'de-program' your own view of evil and then return to the hypothetical you've written with evil monkeys, and then instead make the evil monkeys less like cartoonish, overt sociopath thugs who land in prison, and more like the most cunning angelic Luciferian(the charming and beautiful Lucifer, obviously -- I'm much an atheist as one can get, but this artistic depiction of Lucifer is the closest we've gotten to an accurate portrayal of evil) hero CEOs who secretly enslave the world to ensure their empire rules over all, then you're *beginning* to have a sophisticated conception of evil.\n\nThere's no \"goofy backstabbing\", there's still a total air of benevolence in the evil monkey group. If you were a member of the evil monkey tribe, you'd wholeheartedly believe **you** were the good guys. That illusion is *part* of what makes it evil. It's not like being in a Power rangers show and being some monster that says \"Curse these goody-two-shoes power rangers!\" That's *simply* the burden of your indoctrination, because you currently sit in an evil dominated world.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1563663075,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"euc28lw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cck0gt","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eubhige","permalink":"\/r\/TheMotte\/comments\/cck0gt\/is_your_ideology_below_the_sanity_waterline\/euc28lw\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1572492875,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TheMotte","subreddit_id":"t5_vkedk","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TheMotte","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

We can still make some nice looking log cabins, it's just flat surfaces involve a lot of drudgery to produce with only hammers as tools.

Thank you.\n\nFrom the [following page](https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/full\/10.1111\/evo.13078)\n\n&gt;Biologists have taken the concept of organism largely for granted. However, advances in the study of chimerism, symbiosis, bacterial\u2010eukaryote associations, and microbial behavior have prompted a redefinition of organisms as biological entities exhibiting low conflict and high cooperation among their parts. This expanded view identifies organisms in evolutionary time. However, the ecological processes, mechanisms, and traits that drive the formation of organisms remain poorly understood. Recognizing that organismality can be context dependent, we advocate elucidating the ecological contexts under which entities do or do not act as organisms. Here we develop a \u201ccontextual organismality\u201d framework and provide examples of entities, such as honey bee colonies, tumors, and bacterial swarms, that can act as organisms under specific life history, resource, or other ecological circumstances. We suggest that context dependence may be a stepping stone to the development of increased organismal unification, as the most integrated biological entities generally show little context dependence. Recognizing that organismality is contextual can identify common patterns and testable hypotheses across different entities. The contextual organismality framework can illuminate timeless as well as pressing issues in biology, including topics as disparate as cancer emergence, genomic conflict, evolution of symbiosis, and the role of the microbiota in impacting host phenotype.\n\nCould you frame an abstract example to demonstrate the idea you're expressing? I can offer a template for you if it helps you help me:\n\n\"The year is 2,200 on Earth, and egocentric domination engines have been perfected as a result of the winners of billions of years of domination\/selection games between life on the planet. The naturally selected expression of the strategy that was best able to extend its sphere of dominance over highly local &lt;-&gt; highly global systems finally gained complete control over Earth, and is in the process of expressing its domination phenotype elsewhere in the Galaxy with technological sophistication. The evolutionary system that conceivably defeats this entity is &lt;...&gt;. It does this because &lt;...&gt;.\"\n\nI suspect you're just going to tell me to not think in human terms, or in terms where psychopathy inevitably wins. That's fine.

It's more something everyone ignores and pretends doesn't exist. It's an inconvenient aspect of what everyone who is okay with this whole project accepts. If everyone simply grappled with the scope and scale of suffering on Earth, the only sane move would be to protest this entire project. But most people are either sadists and egomaniacs, who don't have brains wired to care about the problem, and then a smaller minority of people could care, but are suffering from memes which benefit the former class of people. These memes brainwash with various ideas. Suffering is a virtue is a popular one. Aphorisms like \"Keep your chin up!\/Hang in there!\", philosophies like stoicism\/Zen buddhism which accept suffering by redefining it, mythology and fiction which follows the script:\n\n* The world is nice and orderly. \n* There is a problem with the world caused by some evil.\n* Good comes to fight the evil.\n* Good wins. The end.\n\nThis above story is the **the** main toxic meme on planet Earth which continues this farce for most people. No matter which culture you come from, you are brainwashed with this lie. Marvel movies, Ancient myth, Game of thrones, it's all the same thing, with the same message:\n\n\"Heroes exist. Progress exists.\"\n\nBoth lies. The most clever, deceptive, dominant players win the game. Their winnings result in bones thrown to the slave class of humanity, the illusion of progress, while instrumental suffering multiplies due to exploding populations. Each superpower competes in this sick prisoner's dilemma, and for that they need myths and stories to encourage people to live another day, or else they'd hang themselves.\n\nThat's the primary dynamic for the vast majority of Earth, sadists and egomaniac \"winners\", and a sheep class who buys all the myth and propaganda and has children to fuel the Molochian fire even more. Then there are the extremely small minority of outcasts of society who can only look on in horror or severe depression from looking at horror, or both. Life is not a Marvel movie. There is no happy ending in this universe. It's not merely some 'depressed whining', this is just what happens when you get an evolution by natural selection where the most clever and powerful cheater wins every game. Due to entropy, problems are far more easily created than solved. Evil gets the upper hand, and continually lights fires as good tries to put them out. Good loses every time, and evil uses their winnings to indoctrinate everyone into thinking it is the good guy.

I've argued before that antinatalism falls in line with eugenic thinking. Those who farm human beings as workers, soldiers, consumers, and algorithm\/ai trainers want the *sorts* of people who would become antinatalists to be bred out of the gene pool. Antinatalists are loosely allied with eugenicists here in that they think all birth is unethical, so both groups \"get what they want\". \n\nThe loser is the rest of humanity, who inherits a more and more genetically distilled psychopathic dystopia, but this is no different from what has *already* been happening for hundreds of thousands of years. The bad monkeys want the good monkeys to die for various reasons, both consciously and unconsciously. What are some ancient and modern examples? Ancient example: There are two monkeys. Both are hungry. One monkey bashes the other over the head with a rock, and eats meat for days, giving it the energy to keep traveling and find food at some future date. The less psychopathic monkey dies, and nourishes the psychopathic monkey. The eugenics of natural selection takes place, and psychopathy is distilled further in the human genome. Multiply this scenario by billions and billions, and you get humanity today. Good monkeys(which is really just 'less bad' monkeys) get ground up by the bad monkeys. Modern examples of this are less overt because psychopathy has had a lot of distillation time, to develop the holy trinity of camouflage: deception, manipulation, and charm. People can't easily see how lives are ruined, but the fact remains that less bad humans are \"bashed over the heads with rocks\", in metaphorical, modern terms, and \"eaten\", again in metaphorical terms, barring someone like [Jeffrey Dahmer](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jeffrey_Dahmer). All the peasants are \"eaten\" to sustain commerce, for example, by psychopathic monkeys who, at best say, \"This is tough but, we *need* to carry on with your suffering in order to compete with others in this game.\" I'm not that optimistic, and think it involves a lot more apathy towards human suffering, for the same reasons that made the king the king, and the peasant the peasant -- a distillation of psychopathy. The same tools which make the king, create an attitude that doesn't care that the peasant breaks their back or experiences a poor quality of life.\n\n\nLife is only a matter of losing, since there are no winning moves in life, only 'less losing' moves. This is due to the fact that since life is a game theoretical space of winning and losing moves(in totally detached terms), the winning moves by definition require one to be the most skilled cheater(There is no referee to say 'That's cheating!' in this universe, if you win, you win.). This is why I claim that to win is to essentially lose, since to win means to lose in ethical terms. It means that as a winner, you're an even more skilled cheater than the most skilled cheater. Psychopathy vs. psychopathy. To play the game means you've already lost the game, if and only if one is operating on values like ethics or truth. It should go without saying that if you *only* value winning, then you don't care about truth or ethics unless they help you win somehow -- you care about them superficially, as a psychopath would. It may seem intuitive that being unethical and hiding your unethical nature(psychopathy) is a winning move, but what about truth? Why is truth in opposition to winning the game? Wouldn't information that is true only help a psychopathic model for playing this game? No, not necessarily. Truth encompasses self-awareness and ethics. If it's true that one is truly losing by winning, this itself is an antithetical strategy to winning. You can best understand this by thinking about the foundation of many lies: Self-deception. We evolved to deceive ourselves because it allowed us to tell better lies-- the lie which even *we* believe is the ultimate lie and therefore the ultimate social game move. Lying is an adaptation in the same way that being opposed to truth is an adaptation: Truth is the thing that risks exposing the facts of ethics, or the facts of 'winning=losing', therefore truth along with ethics are losing moves in this game. Lying to yourself is a 'game winning' move that ignores truth. If you were a monster because being a monster made you a better game player, would it help you know the full gravity of this fact, or is this a truth that is better left unknown for strategic purposes?\n\nThere is no good vs. evil, only eviler vs. evilest.

The most skilled, least ethical cheater who can successfully convince most of us they aren't a cheater -- wins. It's just that simple. What is cheating? Cheating is playing the game in unethical ways. It doesn't need to be conscious. You don't need to be some mastermind villain twirling your mustache. You can just be a cheetah, programmed to not give a shit and eat other animals alive. The people who dominate reality are very much like cheetahs, who benefit from a phenotype that has been distilled for hundreds of thousands of years for \"winning\" in this game, called psychopathy. Psychopaths can pretend they're the good guys, while actually being the bad guys. They trick themselves into believing they're heroes, and virtuous. This allows them to better trick **you** into believing they're heroes\/virtuous. This is the evolutionary utility of self-deception which we all posses, we lie to ourselves in order to tell the most convincing possible lie to others.

Yet Bundy was not even close to the apex of human psychopathy, he was a failure. The natural selection of our world caught him. He failed the test of the obstacle course. He was sloppy and gave himself away, doing crimes like rape and murder. A true apex psychopath understands that these are not wise moves for 'winning' the evolutionary game, or they **naturally** abstain and are selected, in the same way the ancestors of the caterpillar which makes itself look like a snake in an uncanny way were selected.

I'm describing a property of the totality of spacetime. Entropy, along with the sorts of things that evolution favors, reliably *create* hell. What does entropy have to do with hell and the evolution of apes? Well, apes are social and can function in ways that either value truth and ethics, or don't. Evolution has only one rule, 'the winner wins, and the losers lose.' It's not a tautology for the same reason 'survival of the fittest' isn't, because the implication is the *natural* selection that takes place.\n\n&gt;If instead of eating meat for a delicious and convenient boost, you had to 'eat' slaves with horrific blood magic in order to compete in the blood war, then either the trajectory of the universe is going to be chosen by the most evil people, and only them, or some (otherwise) good people are going to have to develop a contemptuous indifference to atrocity.\n\nWell, the trajectory **will** be chosen by evil people in such a world. There's no \"good slave eaters\" here, that is a self-serving fantasy engaged in by apes who themselves are loosely analogous to slave eaters. You don't have ethical moves in a game that rewards slave eating. You can either become a more skilled slave eater, and that means, your **phenotype** exhibits the sorts of things that are related to slave eating, ie, not giving a fuck as the slave screams, enjoying the flavor of slaves, having brains adapted for the acquisition of slaves and slave eating, the formation of self deception to serve as bedrock for the lie that you're actually eating these slaves for some ultimate purpose, or to tell yourself that you're the good guy, you're doing God's work, etc. You simply don't get to the point of \"Rank 1 slave eater\" without being utterly deranged and evil. So let's drop this fantasy, shall we?\n\n&gt;Now as aside-ed, if you were talking on an eternal scale, it would be true: the universe where you're hitler is one where you're supposed to kill yourself: but because you're dragging the world down into the depths below, not falling of necessity to the present depths yourself, in order that the world not be ceded to those who jump (snarling curses and threats and promises of ignominious endings and deaths) off the slippery slope.\n\nWell, Hitler isn't even the prize if you subscribe to my view of reality. Whoever the winners are, in my view, are the ones who are in prime position for heroic suicide. You cannot be a winner and not be evil, simply due to the nature of natural selection, which reliably [produces evil](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=14), inhibits evil expose mechanisms, and produces [obscuration mechanisms](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv), which [evil](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/p7ggC78.png) benefits from. This is misleading, since Bundy is a failed version of evil, which natural selection said 'No' to. The failed the gauntlet in many ways, he didn't achieve dominance over much of humanity, he was impulsive and wasted his tools on things which an apex psychopath would scoff at, rape and murder? Small fries. The apex psychopath on planet Earth can't really be shown, since, to be the apex psychopath means to be successfully obscured. This is natural selection saying 'Yes'. The apex psychopath is 'the winner who cannot be beaten, except by something which exhibits the phenotype: Domination\/Cunning\/Callousness\/Self-absorption\/Manipulation\/Deception\/Charm in a superior way. Notice how there's no room to be the good guy? If you exhibit these traits, you lose in ethical terms. This is the world we live in. \"But... can't he just be *really* cunning and dominant and only sort of manipulative?\" No. You simply lose unless you've perfectly calibrated these traits in any social hierarchy. And by having the traits, you lose. Therefore, any reality which contains: social systems, entropy, and self-replicating agents, and enough spacetime is a negative sum game in ethical terms. Ours is such a reality.\n\n&gt;Also empirically, where has that trajectory been going? -Are slavery and torture more ascendant now, or in the age of the assyrians? Consider this question and you should have your answer on whether this is a world where participation can only make things worse.\n\nThe trajectory has been going where ever the winners want it to go. If overt torture and slavery are bad for business, then these shall be made more obscure. You are simply making a trade here with apex psychopathy. Apex psychopathy gives you an illusory non-zero sum deal that says \"We will reduce the number of [Junko Furuta's](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Junko_Furuta) tenfold in the next thousand years, simply sell your souls to Moloch, since that's a pretty neato strategy for winning the planet Earth. Creates some real problematic phenotypes for people who want to exist in a sane world. \n\nOf course, it doesn't help that if you're truly honest with yourself, you'll see that you're in an *absolutely* awful position to acknowledge the reality that immediate life extinction is the least bad move available if it really was the least bad move available.

The argument is not \"Parents should ask their nonexistent kids for consent\", the argument is \"You **cannot** impose something on someone which *cannot* consent.\" If this is an ethical axiom you follow, then this reduces to **all** instances where someone cannot consent, including an inability to consent to being made, barring extenuating circumstances in the case of consequentialist ethics.\n\nWe wouldn't rape a comatose human being, even though they cannot give consent since they're in a coma.

Homo sapiens is a functionally psychotic species, wholesale. It gets far worse than this. We are not just shaped to be delusional, we are shaped to be self-absorbed monsters who lack empathy, in a world shaped by the greatest monsters of all, sitting on the monster thrones. You simply do not ascend the heirarchy of Earth, nor the hierarchy of the apex species on Earth, while deeply caring about ethics or valuing truth(*If* we even could, which we can't, since we're all psychotic as explained earlier).

Now, if these baboons were human, you'd get a very intelligent and highly sophisticated justification for this behavior. This is a feature, not a bug. Natural selection ensures that the most psychopathic human beings live, and the least psychopathic, get dominated and are selected out. We are the product of this selection game that has been churning away for hundreds of thousands of years, and millions if you loosen your parameters. As psychotics, we are doomed to be unable to sufficiently realize that our reality is dominated by psychopathic victors of history, an easy feat to manage for controlling several billion hallucinating apes. As psychopaths, we are doomed to not care that most life suffers greatly. We simply sweep this under the rug and enjoy some fleeting hedonic experience, or look towards some silver lining, or illusory progress. Psychopathy is the ultimate social domination framework, due to the following phenotype: Domination\/Callousness\/Self-absorption\/Cunning\/Deception\/Manipulation\/Charm. These traits serve to obfuscate each other, creating a kind of [camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) which natural selection has no problem creating compelling variants of, given enough time.

Get more than they give. Me me me me. \n\nIf this person was truly in it for you, they'd have stayed friends with you and not ghosted you during your most vulnerable period, right?

I really value you and hope you can recover in these next few months.\" Yet... you didn't get this. You just got radio silence. Why, we do not know. Perhaps she viewed you as abusive towards her and couldn't put up with another moment? This is typical with cluster B ghosting, so anyone should understand that. Another possibility is, she viewed you as no longer valuable. 'Lesser than' to the point that you didn't even warrant an explanation. So it's clear she was very much in it for her. Once you couldn't satisfy her ego in the friendship game, she went poof. Either way, the answer is the same. Should we be... devastated about this loss? Or should we be more devastated that we were naive, and didn't understand just how superficial even a truly meaningfully appearing close friendship is? Or should we be devastated that we lacked self-awareness in our friendship? We bear this burden in life due to being indoctrinated by Disney films, cartoons, and happy propaganda. That friendship is this amazing thing and trust and kinship and blah blah blah...but... It's just all a lie. We're selfish monkeys who lie to each other to *feel* good.

Isn\u2019t that a bit of a nihilistic approach to life. \n\nHow would \"everyone is functionally delusional\" lead to \"therefore nothing has meaning\". I don't follow.\n\nI tried to explain to you how everyone is psychotic. Do you think your representation of reality is somehow correct, or something? Or are you unfamiliar with the myriad of ways humans simply fail to perceive reality? Cognitive biases are endless. Self-deception is rampant. You look at someone and see some form of political outrage and it's *patently* obvious this person merely believes the things they believe by sheer happenstance of birth and parents and peer group. This can't be how one becomes in touch with reality.\n\nYou look back a thousand years, and you see people completely and utterly delusional. Driving chisels into their brains to break open holes in the skull to release demons, and they are clearly completely delusional. Do you think they had some sort of humility? Or did they say something like \"What do you mean William, of *course* we're all in touch with reality.\"? Yet at what point did we figure out reality? 400 years ago? 300? 200? 100? Today? Is Today the age we're in touch with reality? Of course not. We're just as lost in temporality as our ancestors were. The only difference is, now if we're lucky we can *see* why we're completely psychotic. Rewind to 200,000 years ago. A grass rustles on the plains of the Savannah. Is it a tiger, or just the wind? If you remain completely skeptical and investigate, and it's a tiger, you're removed from the gene pool. But if you're completely fucking paranoid and think every single rustle is a tiger, or the evil wind god, then you live another day to have babies. Repeat this process over the course of eons, and you get a favorable selection for psychosis and a breeding out of rational thinking. We are **wired** to be delusional.\n\nNot just regarding the universe or tigers, but also socially. If you did not fervently believe in your tribe's politics, you died. You were left behind. You had to believe whatever your group believed. We are bred to conform and not deviate ideologically. We are wired to accept cookie cutter ideas, not to think outside of the box, because those who did were either killed or left behind. So whatever the status quo beliefs happen to be, *that's* what you'll believe. Not because it's **true**, but because you're wired to just be spoonfed whatever helps you survive better.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1564526638,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"evhhwxn","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cjhtcs","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_evhg8aq","permalink":"\/r\/AWLIAS\/comments\/cjhtcs\/boy_am_i_gonna_get_a_lot_of_shit_for_this_one\/evhhwxn\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1573274592,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AWLIAS","subreddit_id":"t5_2vmwn","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/AWLIAS","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

That's natural selection.\n\nThe laws of physics do not allow for *any* other state of the universe other than the ascension of evil in practice(and the necessary camouflaging of it), in this precise universe.\n\nEvaluate all memes with the following question: Does this benefit a perfectly deceptive tyrant to enslave ignorant masses of peasants in the tyrant's unconscious+conscious quest for domination?","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1564541380,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eviemev","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cj659j","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_eveatbv","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/cj659j\/shall_we_all_just_kill_ourselves_think_the\/eviemev\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1573290184,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

However, there are incentives to at least spread the meme that the planet's climate is destabilizing catastrophically. Apocalyptic myth is ubiquitous in human civilizations(I am not claiming climate change is it a myth -- the reality of climate change could serve this purpose in a non-zero sum way). The most recent of these myths, which various forms of media promoted ad nauseam, were the 'Y2K event\" of the start of the 21st century, and the Aztec Doomsday event of 2012. \n\nWho were the beneficiaries of these memes, and who were the losers? It's unclear. I don't think this is necessarily another case of brainwashing of the masses. Perhaps these memes serve as a way to keep the powerful in check, if anything goes wrong people will attribute it to 'the end', and things will destabilize. But destabilization is also good for business. People spend more money when they sense danger looms(Just think of the panic when a hurricane comes, with empty supermarket shelves... and then it sometimes turns out to be a bit of wind.), so perhaps it's just as simple as \"doomsday myths promote livestock to give up their milk to their masters\", livestock here being, human beings who do not serve as rulers over things in some sense. \n\nAll of this is incredibly complicated, and involves factory farming to a great degree which is itself another minigame. Who benefits from massive methane emissions? What is the current energy meta game?(Fossil fuels, coal, nuclear).\n\nThe oil industry is quite the racket, and there are incentives to shake it up. Nuclear is something everyone is tentative in investing towards because it's so easy to sabotage someone's nuclear power plants, a superpower running purely on nuclear is a massive liability, which is why not a single superpower has gone all-in on nuclear. \n\nIt feels like energy is tangential but it's closely linked to climate. The climate is being changed dramatically for a reason. Certain people benefit from this, others don't. There are social engineering utilities to be gained with catastrophic climate change. All of this has to be understood and taken into consideration given that the world is essentially a chessboard.\n\nBut as for \"it's much worse\", my \"It's much worse\" isn't directly related to climate, it's related to the 'chessboard-ness' of things, and how the majority of Earth are essentially sacrificial lambs. That's my short version of \"It's much worse\": Even solving climate could be conceivably worse than not solving it.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1564609561,"distinguished":null,"edited":1564609839,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"evml57l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cj659j","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_evim898","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/cj659j\/shall_we_all_just_kill_ourselves_think_the\/evml57l\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1573362325,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Pessimism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}
