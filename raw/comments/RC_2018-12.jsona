You need to understand that planet Earth is simply a game for the elites from various countries. The Elites of China, Russia, the U.S. are all at war with each other, in a huge race. How do you win the race? Millitary strength, economic strength, population size have something to do with it. What happens to your economy if say, one of these countries decides people can get state funded euthanasia at any time, as long as they are cleared by mental health professionals(Like they do in Belgium) for insisting on wanting to leave existence for fair reasons? Well, these people don't fuel the economy. They don't grow old ,and accrue many tens of thousands of dollars of bills(Especially closer to the end where medical bills skyrocket from all the drugs and hospital care to keep you alive as long as possible). This is many billions of dollars in the grand scheme. The country that does not maximize population, risks losing the race.\n\nPro-life is simply an extension of this \"Race\" or \"Contest\" on planet Earth. You must maximize your population if you want the best odds, at all costs. Our reality reflects this policy. One cannot die even if you're in immense suffering or misfortune. Life is maximized, and anything that prevents life is fought fervently. Everything begins to make sense when you look at the world through the lense of a Superpower, and what incentives they have.\n\nHomosexuality? Well, you'd think that's religious, but the core of it has nothing to do with religion, it's only enforced and actualized via religion. But this is a taboo that only harms the State, and it is an ancient harm that was realized back when nations were just armies and farmers and kings. The \"Nation\" which wasted their men on having sex with other men, rather than making babies, was the Nation which \"lost the game\".
