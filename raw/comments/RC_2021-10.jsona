He's like me but with significantly worse social skills which is why he doesn't have any friends in high school. He's below average academically and his life revolves around watching movies and surfing the internet. I was never close with him and continously neg him so that he studies as he's on his path towards a life that's not ideal. My parents made him take up accounts as hig subjects instead of liberal arts (something he wanted) and now he has his exams in a months time that will decide his future. I'd hate to see him end up attending a uni here as mine is the only decent one and the rest are literally hot garbage. I mean it and I want to be back on good terms with him so that I can convince him to ditch his bad ways and focus on his exams.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Your university matters and the only young people who stay in my town are those who couldn't cut it, plain and simple. Apart from my uni, rest are not worth attending and don't even have classes on time. His life change for the better if he were to study hard and even if you're not smart, you can do well in Indian exams. I know it because I gave them too.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; So please, help me save him. I'll regret never helping him and he's 4 years younger than me and is too young to understand that he is fucking his life up. So please help me be a decent brother and get him to try better. \n\nIf I were you, I would just try treating him with nothing but kindness and with an air of \"I accept you and won't force my values onto you. I won't judge you in a way that ignores your humanity over my values around norms and success and status\". If you truly *nail* that part, you may see a change in him in a direction you'd call positive. But I suspect part of your strained relationship has to do with a failure to do what I described. I can't know of course, and this is just a guess of mine after examining how human relationships\/family bonds fail for decades, since this just a tiny bit of context on the internet from a stranger, so you'll ultimately be the judge of that. But just remember: There's almost no way your brother is *happy* with where he was placed in life-- no one with a lifestyle like his is.

There are religious laws in many faiths around suicide. There's something like \"Do not harm yourself\"(contrasted by pro-Martyrdom Hadiths) in Islam, there's stuff in the Bible, there's something in Buddhism too I believe, and many more.\n\nWhat explains this taboo? Here we are, thousands of years as a \"civilization\" in this Darwinian game. If you were a King\/Queen who was set on winning Darwinian games, what rules would you invent? You'd want a Natalist rule-set, right? You'd want to invent some fairy tale around God commanding that you \"spread your seed\" and \"plunder the Earth\" or some such, right? How strategically useful would it be to say \"Don't have too many kids\" and \"Leave space on the Earth for other living things\"? It just wouldn't win as well as some insane domination strategy would.\n\nYou'd probably make a taboo of homosexuality, since that doesn't make more babies, and more babies, make more soldiers, more peasants, more merchants, more scholars, more taxpayers, and so on. It's just *obvious*, right?\n\nWell the taboo of suicide is precisely founded on this same domination game. If you get dealt the \"peasant\" hand, or the \"quadriplegic\" dice roll, the King who is by definition the apex psychopath, won't ever just go:\n\n\"Oh, darn. Seems you got a little unlucky there. You know what? Free re-roll. Let's just give you these painkilling drugs in a sufficiently large dose that you peacefully die. Better luck next time, buddy :)\"\n\nNo. Of course not. It's instead about **maximizing** time spent alive in the kingdom. **Maximize** pain, and therefore maximize the vampirism around the scrambling to deal with said pain. Maximize consumption. Maximize torture. Maximize martyrdom. That's the **whole point** of all of this.\n\nThat's how the \"Evil Winner King\/Queen\" wins the game.

This is evolution's trick of turning a bug into a feature. So strategically, a thing which only is motivated to harm others is still harmed by its own strategy(sadism). A thing that is motivated or simply not harmed by harm strategies, has a better defense to harm than a thing which panics and screams in terror at harm, but it's not a very pro-active strategy, and evolution eventually needs some kind of winning to happen.

The contrary stuff to this really is crazy!\" is making this exact mistake. Again, the intuition generating thought here is to recognize that your exact argument can be made from within *any* status quo prior to ours, and acknowledging *that* status quo was also batshit insane, delusional, confused, etc(it gets even more interesting once you acknowledge the strategic benefit in having a society that's deeply confused in certain respects). If you do this, you can be almost certain that ours is more likely to be confused than not.\n\nOr you can just continue appealing to the status quo. It's quite psychologically comforting to do after all, and ultimately personality traits(openness to experience, agreeableness, rule-orientation vs. contrarianism) will determine what one will be biased towards. Which is also something anyone who appeals to the status quo fails to take into account. They just feel like they are the \"rational one\" and people who are into \"kooky conspiracies\" are clearly the insane ones, with cognitive\/intelligence failings, etc.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1633395228,"distinguished":null,"edited":1633395547.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hffb3qu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_pzm5gd","locked":false,"name":"t1_hffb3qu","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_hfeavhy","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/pzm5gd\/im_not_particularly_worried_about_confirmation\/hffb3qu\/","retrieved_on":1647680544,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

There are scientists and academics who question our ability to see reality, and a lot of it is uncontroversial and accepted in science. For instance, it's accepted that we simply do not have direct access to reality. What we see \"out there\" is actually a visual field \"**in here**\".\n\nLight spectrum gives rise to color, there's no real \"red\" or \"green\" out *there*. This is totally uncontroversial and understood. Our brains' capacity to be mislead and buggy is truly endless. Endless cognitive biases, blind spots, potential for hallucination, buggy memory, and so on. I highly recommend two books: Strangers to Ourselves(Wilson), and Brain Bugs(Dean Buonomano). That just scratches the surface though.\n\nAnother public intellectual that has received some fame lately is Donald Hoffman. Here's his [TED talk](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oYp5XuGYqqY) on how we do not really see reality as it is but instead fabricate a model of reality that was evolutionarily beneficial. In hindsight, how could it have been any other way? It does not appear that evolution orients us to perceive reality, but evolution rather only orients us to experience \"reality\" insofar as it leads to adaptive behaviors\/genetic propagation.\n\nFinally, since you bring up time, [the current understanding in Physics](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-6rWqJhDv7M) pretty much implies that our brains are essentially fabricating our feelings of time, and the physics gives us a different model of reality than our subjective experiences and perceptions offer us. We feel as if the past is gone, the present is right at the moment you're reading this sentence, and the future has yet to occur. This is called \"Presentism\", but this is incoherent in terms of modern physics. Something called \"Eternalism\" is more coherent, which implies that there is no specific point called \"now\", and \"now\" is merely a feeling that evolved in the human brain because it was evolutionarily advantageous, and all of reality instead is a smearing of slices of time that are all instantiated.

The fairy tales teach a story of progress, because every one ends in a happy ending. Every comic book movie, every sci fi epic, etc. Any story where there's a protagonist and antagonist, we're taught that [the protagonist wins](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Just-world_hypothesis). And even though this is fiction, the *implication* is that this is also how **our** world functions. Look at all the progress. We escaped the tyranny of monarchy with the founding of the U.S. We ended slavery, we gave women rights, and so on.\n\nBut that turns out to be a kind of misdirection if you look very closely. Because reality *functions* in the opposite way. It's not just that it **hasn't** been the way the fictional stories go, but it **can't** be the way the fictional stories go. Read that sentence a second time. It is **physically impossible** for good to defeat evil, because everything in this universe is constrained by rules. Matter is constrained by physics. Math is constrained by logic.\n\nEven the sentence I'm writing right now for me, and the sentence you're reading right now for you, follows the rules of grammar. You can't just suddenly interpret the sentence in a way that totally breaks from the rules of grammar in the same way that I can't write jibberish. To write jibberish right now or to suddenly switch to Finnish or another language I don't know, is to be a person other than who I am. I helplessly write in a way that hopes that you understand what I'm writing, and you helplessly interpret the meanings of the words.\n\nEvolution is another domain that follows rules. And these rules are around a kind of winning. The thing that best survives, wins. That's simply what happens, and it's a **rule**, like: \"2+2=4\". You can't force it to be any other way. Now, what best survives? Well, the most powerful thing in existence by definition has the best chance of survival, surely. And the least powerful thing is likewise in the worst position for survival. We see this even if we only narrowly look at our human-level evolutionary game, and we're an insignificant speck in the totality of all evolutionary games. What happens with humans? The most powerful ones, are prime targets for evolutionary success, and the weakest humans are not seen as evolutionarily worthy-- neither by the genes, or the humans who possess the genes and then abstract the drives of the genes into memes, ie., \"This person is unattractive\", and so on.\n\nWhat this all means is that power is distilled through evolution. It's just a **law** of the universe. It's what replicating matter **does** in our universe. And now what does power mean? Power means something you couldn't have won against, in ultimate terms. It's also a thing that is not constrained by rules. But rather, it *engineers* the rules to its own whims. It's a thing you can't negotiate with. It's a thing that will force its will onto you, not the other way around. Power is not something you can just ignore, it's something you can't even run or hide from. The best metaphor for power is like a black hole. A black hole is *truly* powerful. Once you're in the event horizon, that's **it** for you. It's power is the most powerful thing in the local space, and there's no bargaining, there's no degree of kindness on your part, or honesty, or any good trait or clever trait-- nothing. No new bit of knowledge you can share. **Nothing** will stop the power from impinging on you.\n\nThat's our world. There's a \"black hole\" of power currently, and it's in the form of certain living things on Earth. It dictates the show here, it can't be called \"The good guy\" like in some fairy tales, and is more like \"The bad guy\" in these fairy tales, and it will only get stronger and stronger with time because that's just the way things work.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1633466731,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hfivxrz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q1ucii","locked":false,"name":"t1_hfivxrz","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_q1ucii","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/q1ucii\/western_medicine_and_animal_testing\/hfivxrz\/","retrieved_on":1647672732,"score":9,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Efilism","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

If not, please elaborate, if yes, kindly provide the same elaboration.\n\nSure. It's possible to recognize the deeply negative state of things, but also be happy on the small scale.  It's also possible to find gratitude for all the negative things that haven't happened, but could. This would be totally in touch with reality, and be a source of something to celebrate. You can't account for the fact that you weren't born with [Gabriel Fernandez's](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Gabriel_Fernandez) life. Through sheer happenstance, you're u\/Steph_Mujan instead. Of course, this one life alone turns our universe into a horror show. Forget about other lives, like [Sylvia Likens](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo). Forget the consequences of [world domination endeavors](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KLpM0bo.jpeg), or the history of [torture](https:\/\/cvltnation.com\/one-thousand-cuts-terrifying-ancient-chinese-torture-and-execution-methods\/), or the fact that multiple children have been raped today. Just another arbitrary day, just another day full of child rape. Like yesterday. Like tomorrow.\n\nThere are people alive today who fail to appreciate all of this, who think the world is an okay place, or simply forget how bad this place is, and who actually rises to power here. And they fail to recognize that if there was an off switch to this shit show, you'd be tragically confused not to flick it. And likewise to bring more beings into this world, the world where all of this happens, is deeply irresponsible and not an act born of deep thought, but purely from narratives due to an arbitrary evolutionary mechanism to mindlessly make more stuff. This, like many other evolutionary strategies(rape, theft, murder, etc), ought to be re-evaluated at minimum.\n\nEdit: Also, maybe it's not obvious, but what does it mean to be concerned with happiness as a top priority? One that trumps truth? It doesn't make much sense to me. Wouldn't it make more sense to be concerned with what's true, because once you have access to what's true, you can consider right and wrong? Notice if you're in a hellworld, and through your sheer ignorance you're happy when you *shouldn't* be, you simply have no access to right and wrong.

Everyone's different, so if it sounds like this wouldn't work for you, just disregard it and well wishes to you on whatever your road to recovery may be, but what worked for me is simply recognizing that a monster, like your father, like many parents out there, are thrown into being this sort of person. The sort of person where it wouldn't be easy for someone, even using the words we have available, to capture just how *bad* they are when trying to describe them.\n\nWe already have a fuzzy idea of what causes this. We know genes play a large role. We know an environment of child abuse and neglect creates these kinds of people. This is the most important thing to realize, and this is what I think empowers victims of monsters.\n\nMost people don't actually understand what it's like to be a victim of a monster. They don't even have the sort of ignorance the person who said:\n\n&gt; “you know, my father spanked me too. You should forgive your father.”\n\nThis person is deeply confused, right? One has to have a kind of severe ignorance about monsters to ever say that. It's possible to mean well and say that(of course, it's also possible to be malicious and say that), but one thing is for sure: It's *impossible* to say that while also having a deep understanding of child abuse and and a deep understanding of the most abusive people on the planet. That's such a thoughtless thing to say.\n\nBut it's also possible to be ignorant and think something much more nice sounding. Someone could say:\n\n\"Well, it's all over now so, now you've got nothing to bother you.\"\n\nA person saying this doesn't understand how monsters *stay* inside the human mind. Their awful actions and words can cause abuse even after they are gone. It's not easy to notice how this causes harm, even for the victim. This is why what I'm about to say is so important, because the most important person here is the victim and their recovery. The only thing that could be more tragic than the misfortune of having to suffer for years with this monster, than that *plus* the after effects which haunt the victim even after they rid themselves of one of the worst human beings on Earth.\n\n\n Once the victim acknowledges that the monster was *helplessly* made into a monster, through genes, through child abuse, true freedom is possible. We know with almost with total certainty this is what makes monsters-- just close your eyes and recognize that fact with total clarity, that they don't just happen by accident or by choice. No one stands around before being born and goes, \"Oh sure, sign me up for the psychopath genes please, and give me lots of abuse-- I want to be a person no one can relate to, no one can love, and be unable to show love, and harm those who I would never harm if I were my best self. I want to suffer, and cause others suffering.\"\n\nWhat instead happens is, a deeply unlucky child must first be born, and then harmed over and over. The monster is a victim of a condition where they will cause others pointless misery by first experiencing it and mirroring it. Once we demystify the monster this way, we can see them as this hurt child. They really *were* a child. Again really try to visualize this, it really can help. They were a child who is deeply afraid, crying, in a trauma scenario, being *forced* to become a monster via other monsters, and by forces they have no idea even exist(genes). \n\nWhen we do this, and see the monster as a victim, we can let go of a lot of the negative emotions. When the monster stays a monster, only then can they *still* sit in our heads, haunting us. The attitude that I think is deeply therapeutic, is to see the monster as a very hurt, very vulnerable child. They still are that way, deep down inside. They are lashing out, they are echoing the same abuse that was ingrained into them, and they will likely forever lack the skill to see through it or overcome it. But deep down inside, behind all of that confidence, all of that need to express power over others, they are a very insecure, very vulnerable, fragile and hurt child who was not allowed to be these things due to the sheer serving of abuse they were given. Fully acknowledging this opens the door to letting go of much of the negative emotions like anger, resentment, and all the radioactive fallout that sits and rots and continues to cause truly pointless misery. You and everyone like you deserves to heal, no matter what, so best of luck there no matter how you manage to do it.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1633771741,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hfyp4si","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q3y5g3","locked":false,"name":"t1_hfyp4si","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_q3y5g3","permalink":"\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/q3y5g3\/deleted_by_user\/hfyp4si\/","retrieved_on":1647638128,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

So for instance, a symptom like worrying others can read their thoughts, that seems clearly *bad*, right? Like a \"bug\", no? But it could conceivably be useful.

These are the people who are supposed to be *close* to you by the way. \n\nA common response I get to this idea is, \"Well if everyone's a psychopath, then the word is meaningless. Isn't there a difference between a serial killer and someone who didn't rape or murder someone?\"\n\nYes, there's a difference, but these people are all on a psychopathic gradient due to being members of humanity. The reason is, our species has been weathered by hundreds of thousands, and then if we include ancestor species, hundreds of millions, of years of a truly sociopathic and evil game. The game [looks like this](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fZf9Pa_xeTw), and unfortunately, thousands of years of civilization have not really improved things too dramatically, because [these](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg) are the modern versions of [this very same game](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/KLpM0bo.jpeg).\n\nSo I guess that's the bad news. The species you were born into is evil, evil rules reality, and this is the only way it can be here. You may be thinking, \n\n\"Wait a minute... okay, I'm ready to accept the worst case scenario that things are evil beyond everything our world superficially teaches us as children through fairy tales and superhero movies with happy endings and religions where God is said to love us all and have a plan-- but... can't this be fixed? Surely **real** process is possible?\"\n\nYeaaaah... that's the real bad news. No, it cannot. This is because of a couple  reasons. First, psychopaths are evolution's attempts at dominance. Dominance means breeding, which leads to more fitness games on the domination script. In other words, Bubba is a sociopath who bashes people's brains in with rocks because he doesn't care and likes hearing people go \"squish\". Bubba then rapes someone to have kids(again, he can't process ethics, but this 'bug' is a feature), abuses his kids, and then hundreds of thousands of years pass and Bubba's offspring becomes a successful CEO that dominates countless economic niches and has immense power and influence. This is all in the context of lots of trial and error where the genes make people like Bubba, and children like Bubba's, but they get killed because they're fucking sociopaths so they do something stupid or risky or evil and get murdered as a result(The mortality rate for psychopaths under 40 is 33 times higher than people we consider neurotypical).\n\nBeing nice, or being really smart is cool and all, but evolution actually isn't *as* interested in those things as it is in dominance, and psychopathy is evolution's way of trying to perfect a tool-kit that expresses dominance. A person who is: a) domineering, b) callous, c) self-absorbed\/narcissistic, d) manipulative, e) deceptive, f) sadomasochistic, g) charming, will dominate. The polar extreme opposite of these traits will be a description of what humans would consider deeply \"unsexy\", and this isn't an accident, it's just what results from millions of years of evolutionary trial and error which rewards power, a.k.a. dominance.\n\nThen there's the second law of thermodynamics, where spacetime exists on an entropic gradient. It's easier to burn a house down than to put it out or repair it back to new. So once \"evil\" acquires dominance, it has the edge due to the laws of physics. It can sit back, throw a match, and you, a powerless being, has to work 10, 20, 30 times as hard just to undo the damage. This is simply how the game theory of dominance in our universe works.\n\nAnd this is more or less why your parents are not supportive of you and your friends don't *really* care about you-- it's simply what the evolution rewards.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1634000576,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hgaqgpg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q61x0j","locked":false,"name":"t1_hgaqgpg","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_q61x0j","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/q61x0j\/im_sickened_by_people\/hgaqgpg\/","retrieved_on":1647611794,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

Everything is about \"keeping up appearances\". \n\n&gt; The reason is probably that you're a threat. If you're dumb then you're not a threat, you can be easily controlled. If you're smart, you're a threat and need to be destroyed in their eyes; you can't be controlled so you're a threat because you're able to notice what game they play.\n\nDefinitely, this is true for the psychopathic end of the spectrum.

There's certainly *something* here, and love certainly exists, it's just rare. And when it does occur, it's a kind of mutual hallucination. That's all it can be and that's fine-- if one embraces that and doesn't pretend that love is more than what it is then it's possible to feel any emotion in a genuine way in the context of a being who is oriented to behaviors that enhance fitness at the end of the day. It's still a deeply positive emotion and there's definitely a difference between feeling love for someone vs. feeling hate for someone(It's also possible to foster and nurture feelings of love, few people know this but this has been done by monks\/contemplatives who isolate themselves for months or years and come out radiating love for others as a result of training the mind).\n\nThe issue is when two people *pretend* to feel love. There's lots of situations on Earth where two people really are exploiting each other and don't love each other because they simply don't recognize this evolutionary game. It's that element of our world that is certainly hellish, and then it leads to offspring who suffer from parents who neither love each other, nor can show the child love. A child who doesn't get love becomes a psychopath(superficial exterior, malicious egocentric interior), and so the cycle continues.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1634029560,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hgc1hdy","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q61x0j","locked":false,"name":"t1_hgc1hdy","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_hgbva0d","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/q61x0j\/im_sickened_by_people\/hgc1hdy\/","retrieved_on":1647609027,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

It wouldn't matter if raping children was legal, because it would be wrong.\n\n&gt; From my observations, for humans, ethical tends to mean \"good for me\", while unethical means \"bad for me\". Why do you need extra word for it?\n\nHmm, no, but it does overlap this way of course since humans by sheer happenstance as social creatures evolved ethical intuitions. But no, you're thinking of laws here. Laws are arbitrary in the way you describe. There's no objective \"law\", but there *is* an objective ethics. Things simply are to some degree right and wrong because not every action has the same consequences. So for instance if you were sitting in a pool of gasoline, and I saw this and saw a candle slowly burning down, and you were completely tied and and were about to die a horrific death, this scenario has *real* descriptions, ethically. That's what ethics **means** and **captures**. It wouldn't matter if it would be right or wrong legally, we could be the only two people alive in an empty universe containing nothing except the pool of gasoline, you, and me. The movement here among different actions is what ethics describes.\n\nNotice how you can raise your exact same objection to math? \"Isn't math just 'what is logical to humans', rather than what **is** logical?\" This would be quite confused or dishonest of me to say if I were arguing against math, because it would be some kind of pathological skepticism revolving around a language game because I had some hidden issue against math. It's on the level of the philosophy 101 sort of solipsism where, when left with no other arguments, I go, \"Okay well I can't prove you're not just a figment of my imagination.\" There's really no answer to that. Likewise, there's no answer to math skepticism, if someone wants to use logic to argue *against* logic. Likewise, it's a dead end if someone wants to benefit from an ethical world and be harmed by an unethical world and pretend as if ethics doesn't exist. All you can tell someone there is \"Put your face into some fire to recognize that things really do matter\". If you answer, \"Isn't that just some arbitrary evolutionary mechanism and not really meaningful?\" then you simply haven't put your face into the fire. I promise you that fire+face is a really effective antidote to this cognitive block.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1634190195,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hgkw00k","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q61x0j","locked":false,"name":"t1_hgkw00k","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_hgkt2x8","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/q61x0j\/im_sickened_by_people\/hgkw00k\/","retrieved_on":1647589586,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizoid","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

That person you would con by giving them 10+10+10 would quickly discover themselves more poor, and hopefully they would see it's due to an ignorance of logic and math. Right?\n\nNow the same is true for a person who can't intuit ethics, which is why I hypothetically suggested face+fire. If someone were to torture you, the utility of ethics would become crystal clear. The hypothesis here is that torture is unethical. Again, words have meaning. Mathematics isn't captured by the way certain mushrooms grow under certain species of pine tree. Yes, mathematics is integral to physics, but this would be a dishonest argument. The point is that the *centrum* of math is not captured by mushrooms and pines. \n\n**Objectively**.\n\nLikewise, the *centrum* of ethics is *not* captured by mushrooms and pines. Or rocks. Why? Because ethics means something, like any other word. It captures the suffering and wellbeing of something that is conscious, like you. If you think that's useless, then you just are unable to appreciate that you benefit from a world that distinguishes your suffering vs. your wellbeing to some degree. All it would take here to discover ethical salience, is taking you by force, into a scenario where you experience what unethical acts are.

Bold claim, right? So the prescription here is mindfulness meditation. This is a \"mystified\" exercise, but just forget all about that for now and only try to intuit this:\n\nStrength is something humans train. It's simple, really. You pick up a heavy thing, and then you put it back down. You get stronger, the more you do this, and gradually increase the weight.\n\n**That is it**. If you can just convince someone who feels bad due to feeling feeble, to pick up heavy things for a few days per week, a few hours per day, they will experience **dramatic** results. Simply uncontroversial, right?\n\nThe exact same is true, but with the mind, and instead of strength, things like attention, focus, clarity, and mental acuity. And this process follows the very same simple-but-not-easy formula. Oh, and one more thing? Almost no one seems to understand this, it's left to the fringes, it's not normalized like training strength or physical fitness is. That's our current world. This is critical to understand here because this could be what prevents you from giving this a solid college try.\n\nWhat does that look like? It means just taking about 20 minutes out of your day, to sit down, with your eyes closed, and just watch yourself breathe. (For comparison: It means just taking about 20 minutes out of your day, to sit down, and lift+put down dumbells).\n\nDo this for about 3 months, and you will see results. These are results that people take drugs to achieve, and only temporarily, by the way. Expensive drugs, sometimes. This is free, and only takes 20 minutes or so daily, which, even if you're one of the busiest people alive, surely you waste 20 minutes per day thinking about some sort of neurosis or thing that causes you pointless suffering, right? Skip that, or do that *while* training the mind. That's when you'll see it clearly for maybe the first time, as an object in awareness, and not something you are identified with.\n\nThis exercise rewires the brain, and we know this. We have put monks into fMRI's and we know that there's diminished activity in the \"Default mode network\". So this isn't something imaginary, but the problem is we just can't see it as tangibly as the way we see a huge dude who has clearly lifted for 12 years of his life. But mentally, that's what serious meditation can do, for the mind. Not even drugs, as far as I know, can get the [sort of possibilities that decades of training the mind can bring](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c#Day_of_the_act).\n\nYou may be thinking: What're you crazy? You're trying to sell me meditation by saying, \"You'll be able to burn yourself alive, even!\" No, not quite, but imagine you were to be so unlucky as to be burned alive. Would you want to have the mind of this monk?

All I'm saying is the word \"wrong\", in a context that involves conscious beings who can suffer(The thing you're concerned about), actually has a meaning that isn't a in the ontological category of \"I like vanilla\/I like chocolate\". I don't claim to know with total certainty what is right or wrong(could the sorts of people you worry about ever say this? Is objective ethics really the issue with the people you worry about, or something else, like dogmatism? Psychopathy?), but I claim to know that there must be a right and a wrong, because it can't be the case that right and wrong are purely a toss-up. In other words, it can't be the case that your video of Islamic fundamentalists burning people who they think did something wrong alive or beheading people or blowing up buses full of children, are **identically** ethical or totally non-distinct, compared to say, the ethics and behaviors of [these people](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W9AlCDVXJc4). What I *am* certain of is there is a distinction here ethically.\n\nWhat I'm saying is there's a real, tangible difference, in a context that is captured by the term 'ethics', between these two scenarios. In one, you have sociopaths with a memetic parasite that emboldens their psychopathy, in another, you have people who happened to have stumbled on a memeplex that makes it quite *difficult* to cut someones head off and only easier and easier to be kind. I can't know for sure, but I would postulate that it's not just subjectively true(It's subjectively true in the sense that it has to do with subjects), but *objectively* true(because it describes the objective space containing the only possible things that relate to these concepts, things like being kind, vs. torturing someone), that the latter is more ethical than the former.\n\nYou can know this again by just examining the nature of a claim like: \"Eating bread is the least ethical behavior possible.\" That's not merely a subjective claim. That's actually an objective claim, and the claim happens to be wrong. It would be bewildering to discover if that were the actual ethical bullseye of this reality. That would mean consuming bread is worse than raping a child, or causing someone years of psychological distress, or robbing someone of their life savings.

We start with some conception of \"normal\", behaviors, thoughts, etc, and then attempt to orient **everyone** to that standard. This seems like something out of the 50's, and that's because it is. Psychiatry still has this antiquated, uncreative, discriminatory baggage in the current models, culture, philosophy.\n\nA lot of the things we call disorders are actually attempts at adaptive behavior. A lot of the things we deem \"bugs\", are actually features. If someone gets severely depressed for example, and stays in bed all day due to rock bottom serotonin, well that was a behavior that improved survival for our ancestors. When they got *really* unlucky in an exceptionally cruel environment, laying low was precisely what improved survival.\n\nYet we just *assume* that things like these and other \"disorders\" or \"illnesses\" are just something that has to be \"fixed\". In some cases, sure, it does. But I'm just calling into question the assumption that it is *always* the case, because this is the current psychiatric approach.

Certain *kinds* of suffering are alleviated by money, but new kinds emerge as well. You're in proximity to absolutely cut-throat evil, so I can't imagine that it's fun to be a high profile rich person in general.\n\nSo what is the crucial variable? It's what *makes* someone rich: Which is psychopathic traits. Psychopaths certainly suffer, but they have the trait sadomasochism, which simply is an orientation\/motivation to cause suffering, and an orientation\/motivation to endure suffering-- simultaneously. In game theoretical terms, this is obviously a superpower. Just add this trait to any famous athlete, it doesn't even have to be a contact sport.

It *seems* as if it should be so straightforwardly \"either a lie, or an innocent confusion\". But after thinking deeply about human interaction, doing a lot of it myself, and examining the way my own brain works and really scrutinizing others, I think it can often be both. The brain is just not intuitive, you can have these multiple conflicting mind-states that appear paradoxical. In one sense, there's knowledge of the lie. In another sense, there's a kind of mindless, robotic innocence of confusion. And it's really unclear which is which, and sometimes it's both. Again, that seems contradictory, but that's how our minds can often work. Sometimes it is clear cut, but often times I find it just isn't. This is what you get with this wetware that has been evolved to be endlessly manipulative, even manipulating the host itself.\n\nWhether or not it could be said for every statement though... well, no, I don't think so because this is specifically on the matter of a precise social behavior-- the insane dominance games acquaintances or friends play with each other for the purpose of becoming socialized, where they belittle each other in subtle ways under the pretense of humor or playfulness. I think this isn't just true for \"teasing\" as OP said, but all jokes. They say \"there's a grain of truth to every joke\", and that's clever, but I think the deepest wisdom on the matter here is rather: \"there's a grain of *joke* to every joke\". Nothing is actually ever a *joke*. For it to be funny, it must have some sort of truth or logic to it, and the truly funny stuff is so because it's so unutterable in a context devoid of humor that the only *acceptable* way to state the idea would be to present it in joke form.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1634668771,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hh9jhxw","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qarknz","locked":false,"name":"t1_hh9jhxw","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_hh7lgc1","permalink":"\/r\/CPTSD\/comments\/qarknz\/i_dont_find_sarcasm_or_teasing_funny\/hh9jhxw\/","retrieved_on":1646713776,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"CPTSD","subreddit_id":"t5_2vvid","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/CPTSD","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I must ask:\n\n&gt; I keep trying to peel apart and distinguish an autism spectrum from a schizo-spectrum, but the reality might be that they are heavily mingled. \n\nHave you heard of my own speculation here? I think they're two separate spectrums based on processing the data of the world. I mean raw data, sensory data. Autism I associate with precise detail orientation, but poor pattern orientation. And Schizo I associate with the opposite, high pattern, poor detail.\n\nTo make this less abstract, what do we *mean* when we say someone is 'autistic'(in a negative way)? We mean that they're cold, robotic, mathematical, trees-but-no-forest. Our fears about AI are really just robots that can be called autistic following a script to **perfection**(every detail executed flawlessly, mathematically), and therefore missing some bigger picture, and causing chaos\/suffering. Autism is often associated with categorization, in some obsessive way, like license plates or other numbers etc. This makes sense as a pathological(but not necessarily) detail orientation. Autists see the world very richly, lots of dots, but not a lot of pattern.\n\nSchizotypes are sort of the opposite as far as I can see. They see patterns *everywhere*, and this doesn't mean they're delusional about everything. I think this is the superpower in the pathology-- *some* complex and rich patterns will **only** be available to schizotypes because there's just no other way to access such a pattern. You *could* access it through some pragmatic, mathematical, systematic method like science or logical reasoning, but it would just take too much time and too much work and evidence and proofs. The schizotype bypasses all of this and just *generates* this pattern by fiat. Again, it's often wrong, but when it's right, it doesn't even matter how the pattern emerged because since it's true, it just snaps into place within the representation of reality. Schizotypes see the world richly too, they're not very good at getting the precise facts of reality right, those can be fuzzy or just plain wrong, but the patterns they see are very rich-- lots of patterns, but grainy dots.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1634871344,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":1,"gildings":{"gid_2":1},"id":"hhkp037","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_qbqa7z","locked":false,"name":"t1_hhkp037","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_hhk9f8n","permalink":"\/r\/Schizotypal\/comments\/qbqa7z\/hey_whats_your_myers_briggs_personality_type\/hhkp037\/","retrieved_on":1646689880,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizotypal","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlzo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizotypal","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

This is what we tend to do when we have empathy for other people. This adds justification to one’s behavior which can potentially be problematic when trying to correct ones behavior. It is essentially self-enabling. \n\nThe reason I think this is wrong is right here, at the very beginning of this hypothesis.\n\nIt's absolutely true that one's behavior *is* a product of one's circumstances, and not some magical force generated from a vacuum which overrides causation(called \"Free Will\"). This *does* tell us that people are not morally blameworthy. No actual *empathy* is required to arrive here, purely an examination of reality, which is that we exist in a causal soup, and we are not independent of this soup, and that we're simply *whatever* we are, helplessly, in ultimate terms.\n\nThis does tell us that the way we treat others, and the way we treat ourselves, is a little strange. Because much of this *pretends* we could have done otherwise than we did in any events, which we know isn't true.\n\nHowever, here's where this goes astray:\n\n&gt;  This adds justification to one’s behavior which can potentially be problematic when trying to correct ones behavior. It is essentially self-enabling. \n\nSo, suppose someone has very low willpower for sweets. They're over at a friends, who has just announced they purchased their favorite candy bar for their birthday, and will be eating it to celebrate after a quick bathroom break. This someone then stares at the candy bar for a minute, tells themselves, \"You know... we don't have free will after all, and it's *true* that my willpower for these things is weak, so you know what? I'm just going for it. Hopefully my friend will understand my situation with the same empathy I have for myself.\"\n\nAnd they proceed to just scarf down the bar, finishing the last bite as their friend returns with shock all over their face.\n\nWhat is going on here? Is this *really* a situation where too much empathy is the meaningful culprit of this anti-social behavior? No, that's kind of absurd. Other variables are operative here, one, namely being that the candy bar eater is a total egomaniac who is apparently completely disconnected from the lives of others. They're living in such a totally narcissistic bubble that they can't comprehend how wrong it is to just take and eat other's things. This has almost *zero* to do with too much good-will and forgiveness towards oneself, but an actual moral failure in other respects.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1635080170,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"hhuuh8y","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_q9ztgz","locked":false,"name":"t1_hhuuh8y","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_q9ztgz","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/q9ztgz\/selfempathy_could_lead_to_psychopathic_tendencies\/hhuuh8y\/","retrieved_on":1646237844,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"unrepliable_reason":null}

I believe Schizoids are uniquely advantaged here( despite being clearly disadvantaged in other ways-- I'm not simply claiming \"The disorder is actually a super-power!\", to be clear), because they have some degree of dissociation. If one can be highly dissociated, and highly lucid, then this is what Buddhism actually means by \"Enlightenment\". This is what the training does, and how, for instance, a monk can set himself on fire and not flinch. Association is what neurotypes feel when they say \"I'm me\". Dissociation is witnessing thought not as a egocentric hallucination, but as objects independent from some kind of dualistic phenomenology. Simply put, people think thoughts, emotions, and have sensations, and then they model their \"self\" on those things, and this feeling can be totally dissolved with dissociation. Which is what is happening when someone takes a drug or has a traumatic encounter and experiences what is called \"ego death\"-- they are no longer captivated by the little story in their heads that makes them feel like they're the main character of the only movie that exists, which is what association is.\n\nSo, pure dissociation, the kind brought on by trauma, or Schizoid PD, or the \"dissociative\" class of drugs(or others like psychedelics), is not terribly helpful on it's own. But when combined with attention, which is the other element  that is trained in mindfulness, one can get a kind of clarity and mental acuity that is hard to find elsewhere. If there were a drug that produced the effects of decades of training the mind, it would be highly sought after, coveted, illegal, and prohibitively expensive. This is one of those things that's available for free and I think should be taken advantage of, the more often and more rigorously and sooner, the better.
