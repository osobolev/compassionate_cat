Their calves are taken away mere hours after being born so that the milk intended for them can be collected and sold for human consumption. Over the days following separation, the mothers bellow day and night, searching for their calves. They\u2019re known to grieve for days or even weeks. The male calves, called bobby calves, are considered useless to the dairy industry because they\u2019ll never be able to produce milk. They are kept isolated for five days before being herded onto a truck, and sent either to a saleyard first, or direct to the slaughterhouse. They can be withheld food for the last 30 hours of their lives.

The reason this masking is important is because without some form of camouflage which we already know can [evolve to an uncanny and unbelievable degree](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv), evil would be plain to see and then it would be more vulnerable, which by definition is less powerful.

But that's not even important for this point of yours, which appears to be: \"People disagree about ethics, therefore ethics are brittle guides, therefore there are no ethical truths\" does... not... follow.

To have empathy at all times is to lose your mind. If there were a pill to give you perfect empathy( all this means is a. understand all states of wellbeing and suffering on Earth at all times and b. care about wellbeing), one would immediately bash their skull into the closest hard surface like a cetacean who has been tortured in a marine park. \n\nNotice how this level of madness is certain to terminate someone's ability from making ethical moves or even evaluating the ethics in *order* to make ethical moves? This is the problem with empathy on the small, human scale too-- It can help us detect ethical problems but it can also trigger emotions which harm our ability to process reality and\/or act accordingly. You can see this clearly in dietary veganism(I say dietary veganism to distinguish purely the *diet* aspect, from the moral aspect-- perhaps there are better semantics to use here), where say, a primarily dietary vegan is waiting in line at Burger King to purchase some new plant based burger, and at the end of their order they add, \"Oh! And could you please clean the grill? I don't want to consume any meat residues! Thank you.\" Meanwhile, if the cows being [tortured](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3248) at the exact moment you're reading this sentence could speak English, they would say, I imagine, something like:\n\n&gt; \"I don't *fucking* care about that, you dumb monkey. Something that trivial is one of the least ethically relevant things you could possibly do with your time. I don't even care if you buy the fucking *real* whopper! It has near-zero ethical cash value in the real world, because we're still getting **fucking** tortured. **DO SOMETHING** that does not involve what you're stuffing your face hole with you virtue signalling egomaniac.\" - Cows\n\n The above comes about from me using my best efforts to actually put myself in the shoes of all cows being tortured and imagine higher aliens are eating meat products made from copies of me. The level of anger and outrage expressed here of course, can never match the moral crime, so just multiply it by trillions or something to get something closer to the meaning. I don't say this to somehow accuse all vegans of this sort of oversight of course, since there's plenty of genuine concern that hits the nail on the head, no area of our world better brings to light the torture of animals today than vegans and their efforts. But I doubt the \"average vegan\" has constructed a \"skin in the game\" style of thought experiment where they try to relate to animal torture as precisely, accurately, and unemotionally as possible. The point of empathy, veganism, ethics, that I am making with these last two paragraphs is that emotions reliably mislead us because ethical ideas are so deeply emotional to us.\n\nThe ego really does hate recognizing that suffering is everywhere, because our egos like to optimize \"Me centered\" thinking. Think of the ego as like, a very selfish parent who has their child's friend over, and they really dislike this friend and see the friend casually walking to the refrigerator and taking out a snack. \"That's *our* snack. Meant for *our* genetic carriers.\" That's what caring about suffering outside of one's own can be like for the ego, and then it invents a story about why the ego doesn't care about suffering or can't act: \"It wouldn't do much good\" or \"I'm too tired\" or \"I don't have enough money\" or \"I'm the one who needs help\" , etc etc etc.\n\n A kind of pro-social hack to the natural psychopathic state of the ego is to recognize that caring about best dealing with the eternal problem of the negative state of reality is a kind of \"ultimate win condition\", but whether or not psychopathy or pro-social psychopathy(the only 2 games in town) win here, is sort of a coinflip based on traits and variables outside of one's control.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1615000093,"distinguished":null,"edited":1615001652.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gpuu8is","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lymz1c","locked":false,"name":"t1_gpuu8is","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_lymz1c","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/lymz1c\/i_know_this_philosophy_is_about_compassion_and\/gpuu8is\/","retrieved_utc":1627131104,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

But the fact that they *never* go after slaughterhouses or do anything with real world effects on animal suffering? That's just patently untrue, there are people expressing energy in this regard in various ways to various degrees, so surely you don't believe they \"*never*\" go after those who abuse animals?\n\n&gt; they only target the vulnerabilities of common lot and exploit their guilt.\n\nNo, not \"only\", but unfortunately something like this is the case with a large chunk of veganism where it's nothing other than: \"Okay, need to just eat coconut milk yogurt and lentils and my conscience is guilt free, phew.\" and then in the next breath: \"WHAT?! How *dare* you consume animals, you monster!\"\n\n I can't be sure but I have a suspicion that this style of veganism(I'm describing the idea that dietary changes are strongly related with animal liberation) *could* actually create more animal suffering than it relieves.

The easiest case to recognize this truth is if the core rule is birth=bad, how would a birth that **directly** causes less birth function? Surely this birth would be good, even if we know **nothing** else other than \"Birth=bad\". This is why deontological\/highly linear\/highly autistic\/highly rigid\/highly rule-based thinking with respect to ethics is misleading.\n\nNote: I use \"autistic\" here in purely descriptive terms to identify a style of thought, not in the pejorative.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1615193292,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gq6xzx0","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lzxfri","locked":false,"name":"t1_gq6xzx0","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_lzxfri","permalink":"\/r\/AskAnAntinatalist\/comments\/lzxfri\/is_there_any_meaningful_difference_between_a\/gq6xzx0\/","retrieved_utc":1627151392,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskAnAntinatalist","subreddit_id":"t5_287k4n","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Do you think you could have done otherwise? How do you imagine the physics of the universe manifests this deviation? How do the neurons, which presented you with the exact choice you made earlier, fire differently? Do the atoms serving as the neuronal substrate move differently? If you rewind the universe to the state prior to your choice, would you have been able to make a *different* choice in a way that is logically coherent with what we know about the nature of the world? What does it say about the possibility of \"freedom\" if there was no other choice to be made?\n\n&gt;You may say that much of this is outside of my control because they depend on the actions of my past self, which I can no longer control.\n\nThe semantics here get tricky, and require precision. You have control, which is to say, you have the \"power to influence events\/things\/people\", but only in the most narrow definition possible. You don't have any **free** control, however. To say \"you\" have control is identical to saying the Sun has control over the illumination of Earth. You are ontologically identical to the Sun in your freedom-- the only difference between you and the Sun is, you are **observing** your control, the Sun is not(presumably). You both have zero freedom in the identical sense.\n\n&gt; However, I did take decisions in the past that that I was conscious of and that led to the situation now\n\nYes of course, none of this is problematic, but was there any freedom involved? If so, where was the point that was not purely causally determined by prior causes, and at what level?\n\n&gt; Of course, there is no quality that I posses to make me free, no power I have that other don't, no variable that I am the sole master of and I think that searching for that is futile.\n\nThen how can you call a choice free? This is logically inconsistent with the idea that you have \"some freedom\"\n\n&gt; In practice, our actions and choices do matter [...]. It is important how we use this door, these chances. \n\nSure, it's a common fallacy that determinism=fatalism\/nihilism. No free will does not mean things are doomed to fail\/guaranteed to succeed, nor does it mean that there's no meaning or point to the universe.\n\n&gt; and we have more choice regarding some actions than others.\n\nMore choices have nothing to do with freedom. Think of an animal on Earth. There are endless species on Earth, right? Think of any species and observe your own mind function here. No one is holding a gun to your head. Recognize that your neurology, psychology, total knowledge of species, determine this answer. There's no \"freedom\" to think of something-- your brain just *manifests* this animal insofar as you cooperate with what I asked. Try it as many times as you want. Keep thinking of animals and pay close attention to how the brain comes up with these. Are you the agent *choosing* or do animals just manifest from the darkness of your mind? To choose something freely would be to choose it before it even enters your mind-- it's logically incoherent as an idea. Again this is a very high number of choices, zero of them are free choices. I could have asked you to pick one side of a two sided coin(only two choices) and the freedom does not change from the animal question.\n\n&gt; In the circumstances I find myself in, towards which I have contributed in the past, I am choosing to talk to you, even if there are other choices that I can make.\n\nSure, this is all agreeable. I am choosing to talk to you too, and there were other choices on offer for me too. But where is the **free** choice here?

Someone naiive of evolution and biology could think they're actually protecting themselves by pathologically disinfecting everything, but what they're doing is: 1) Making stronger pathogens 2) weakening their immune system by making everything around them sterile. Fighting the pathogen makes the pathogen stronger, as long as you don't wipe it out completely. Likewise with life, fighting life makes the life stronger, as long as you don't wipe it out completely.

I desire the following: A single, tiny droplet of freedom. I'm claiming there is no such droplet in the entire universe.\n\n&gt;but I think that sometimes we can also choose. \n\nAgain... I am not saying we cannot choose. This is about **freely** choosing. No choice exists which is *not* rigged by prior causes outside of one's control. This is by definition not free.\n\n&gt; Not all the times, certainly, but there are times we can pause and say ''I want more options'' or ''I need more time to think about it'' (thus kind of forcing the Choice-giver to give more options).

Where is the moment of freedom? An infinity of determined causal chains of infinitely changing your mind is *still* zero freedom. You can pause for as long as you want, but the choice is still determined. The fact of you **pausing** or not, is determined. Why do you assume that your pausing to choose is somehow exempt from the causal chain? \n\n&gt;Still, based on the information we have, on our capacity to reflect on past and future, we can make informed, conscious decisions. \n\nThis does not get us to a free choice. Even omniscience doesn't give one even a tiny window to make a free choice. If you doubt this, simply consider where this freedom exists and point to it. It is nowhere to be found.\n\n&gt; If not, if there is no way one could've done otherwise, why do we decide to punish people? \n\nBecause our entire criminal justice system is based on the completely incoherent idea of free will.\n\n&gt; How can you justify punishing such people, if there was nothing they could've done differently? (In my view, what they did was certainly wrong and they deserve punishment, whether or not one believe in free will but I am curious to hear your thoughts on this).\n\nWe can't justify *punishing* people.

The always appear to be related but if a conflict arose(some representations of the world make this possible, perhaps), suffering would win in describing what \"ethics\" is. It's like saying you need hearing for sound to exist. Hearing sure does help, but it would be a confusion of the ontology of sound to say you **have** to be in the forest where the tree is falling for it to make a sound. Sound is not merely an arbitrary hallucination, but a real description of reality, and the phenomenology of sensing that description.\n\nEthics is too a real description of reality. Rocks do not appear to suffer, but things called 'children' suffering things called 'abuse', do. Words like \"Sound\" and \"Ethics\" have an objective meaning. \"This rock is miserable\", apart from some poetic context, is incoherent, both from the perspective of the subject, **and** (ready for this part? This is where the entire point is located, that resolves the ontological confusion of all anti-realists)...\n\n**no perspective whatsoever**.

Maladaptive\/Adaptive here just means \"Bad\/Good survival strategies\". Society tends to encourage adaptations, and discourage maladaptive behavior culturally. This is just the cultural level however, and there's a much stronger evolutionary level operating under all of this. Obviously, genes that express as sufficiently maladaptive traits, have a poor chance of propagation. It turns out that if it were true that one was firmly within a hell gradient, and *realized* this, it reliably leads to poor outcomes(and poor genetic outcomes). Meanwhile, being *ignorant* or *positive* about being in hell, would have a strategic advantage in surviving in this hell. This is why we tend to cringe when we hear someone constantly expressing negative ideas. We find it deeply unpleasant, exhausting, unsexy, etc.\n\nEdit: A core confusion here is people impose their values when looking at evolutionary perspectives. They'll think something like: \"Why do bad people seem to get ahead in life, but good people are frequently seen suffering?\" or \"Well how come something like *intelligence* isn't sexy? Isn't being smart a *good* thing?\" \n\nNo, not inherently. Being smart can cause one to realize the world is hell, or that the things that rule the world are evil. The intelligence works against you here, and it would be foolish to reproduce with such a person.

There are roughly two, the traditional status quo, and the progressive(simply a euphemism) status quo-- these norms are incompatible with each other, but if one breaks away from both of these representations of gender, it's strongly frowned upon. I share a lot of your views here after simply observing the gender specific behavior in people while growing up and in adulthood, and thinking for myself. I shall break that taboo now to express my thoughts on gender.\n\nMen appear to be aggressive, egocentric, callous libido monsters, which cause women a great deal of anxiety, discomfort, fear, annoyance, general suffering, etc. Women, appear to be manipulation monsters, completely entitled to provoke men sexually due to the courting dynamic where men must approach women who then ultimately select\/reject the man, leading to a scenario analogous to a world of starving people where the well fed are encouraged to walk around with plates of tantalizing food. \n\nBoth genders to me seem immensely toxic in their own ways, and this is of course through no fault of any gender. No human being is to blame for the products of an evil evolutionary game, and it's clearly not rational to \"hate\" a gender just because it evolved to behave in ways that cause the other gender suffering. This is like hating a rattlesnake for being venomous, and painfully biting you when you cross paths. This is also not to say that it impossible for someone of one gender to express traits of another, or that there are not positive traits in the genders, but the cons seem to outweigh the pros. \n\nThen there's the suffering that the genders inflict on *each other*, which is most plainly on display during puberty and middle+high school. Boys are clearly just learning to fine-tune their natural psychopathic behavior here, and play various domination games amongst each other, torturing the weakest boys. Girls are no better, and often worse-- as they learn how to socially manipulate each other and the boys, they are so notorious in how viciously they bully other girls that the suicide rate for girls in this age range is roughly 3 times higher than in boys.\n\nWhat is all of this for?

On the surface, humans seem to be good. They get along for the most part, they smile at each other, they say they believe in good things, etc. But that's not the reality.\n\n&gt; When you go below the surface, beyond all that flowery stuff, you get the real picture. Humans only do things if it benefits them. They're only nice to people in so far as it benefits them.\n\nYes, you nailed it. What we're calling 'evil' is really just psychopathy. There's no fictional representation of evil(think to any horror movie, or book, or mythology) you've encountered, that doesn't fall into the description of a least a few of the following traits to *some* degree:\n\n* Domination\n* Callousness\n* Sadomasochism\n* Egocentrism\/Self-absorption\/Self-aggrandization\n* Manipulation\n* Deception\n* Charm\n\nIf you think of something super cliche, like, a cheesy villain in fiction, they're very often lacking some of these traits. They're either hilariously weak for something that is \"evil\", *or* they are so overtly evil that they don't exhibit the last 3 traits very strongly. This is what you'll find in all big memetic mediums of profit, the Marvel movies, Game of Thrones, all the stuff that indoctrinates us like the Abrahamic religions, mythology, fairy tales-- these are all cartoony representations of evil. These memes are not accidental, and they're not stupid. They're memes which are a part of the extended phenotype of evil. They are an expression of evil which serves to create a \"shade\" on the world, to mislead everyone. Evil *thrives* in the world where the kid grows up watching Star Wars, or is taught about Satan and God, or taught about any story that involves the following script: \"The good underdog battles the all powerful evil antagonist, and after a long hard battle, even as it looks like good is about to lose... through sheer determination, force of will, magic, faith, &lt;insert any cliche&gt;, good... wins! And they walk off into the sunset or bring about the utopia.\" This is not how reality works. Ever. \n\nReal, meaningful evil can't be seen easily. It has deception, charm, manipulation. It is [camouflaged](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) via natural selection. Ted Bundy who raped and murdered(or sometimes in reverse) dozens upon dozens of women, would park his car on the road and wear his arm in a sling to feign being injured\/signal weakness and low threat. This is the behavior of evil. If one understands this, and understands that this kind of signal is **all over our current world**, this is when one will begin to understand evil. This is \"what wins\", in a game theoretical sense and a literal sense. It's what gains power over everything.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P2tYoWqHe10\n+\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/y0W0e3A.jpg\n+\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3228\n\nThis is a world of winners, and to win, you must be the dirtiest player. What incentivizes this dirty play? Well, simply that there are no rules. There's no referee. There's no God or Mothership of advanced benevolent aliens watching over us to step in and say \"Bup bup bup! Tha'ts too far! That's too evil and unfair!\" Nothing like this. \n\nThe only rule is **win**. Then evolution rewards the winner. But... yes, the other players can get mad. So what is the counterplay to this sole issue holding back total and unbridled dirty play? Deception, Manipulation, Charm, Domination. Confuse the the other players about who or what is the problem. Overwhelm their ability to process information. Broadcast a superficial and falsified representation of reality. And control all the avenues which lead to power. This is the nature of reality, and it is not *merely* dominated by evil by happenstance but this is the **only** way our reality of self-replicating things on an entropic gradient *can* organize.

It\u2019s not that we\u2019re doomed to live in a meaningless universe\u2013it\u2019s that we get the chance to experience ourselves and the universe we share.

This is the core error every single anti-realist and nihilist makes, they think that subjectivity and objectivity are somehow ontologically divided in some super strict sense, but this is not true. Every subject is also an object. There are objective truths about subjective experiences. Experiences relate to ethics, the word \"ethics\" has meaning. It has nothing to do with rocks.

Even if you're the **only** thing that exists, and you're a Boltzmann brain and everything else that appears in your consciousness is purely a hallucination in your mind, it's still descriptively true of such a universe to say \"The statement that ethics relates to conscious experience is **objectively** true.\"","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1616171661,"distinguished":null,"edited":1616241629.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"grhvb0g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m899yw","locked":false,"name":"t1_grhvb0g","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_grhr94e","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/m899yw\/he_definitely_knew_what_he_was_talking_about\/grhvb0g\/","retrieved_utc":1627233896,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Most sparrows do. The actual suffering of sparrows &gt;&gt;&gt; actual suffering most humans will ever get to experience.\n\nSee it just doesn't strike me that this is the case. I was walking around my neighborhood today, on my way to the post office and it was a sunny day. The sparrows were chirping and fluttering around. The food supply here is not an issue because it's a big city so scraps are everywhere. Tons of shrubs and trees and little courtyards. No real predation compared to the wilderness. Do sparrows live *good* lives? Clearly not, nothing does. But compare this to people who are struggling with poverty(a big city problem). I don't think humans are as well off on average as you think. Do you by any chance live well above the poverty line?\n\n&gt; I think that feels worse. But taking a step back, that just says more about my reaction to reading it than the actual brain state of the victim. A sparrow suffering cannot bring the same level of empathetic response inside me. That doesn't make its suffering automatically less significant.\n\nYou're right, we fail to empathize with sparrows more than we fail to empathize with people, but I'm making my best effort to take this into account.

And to say there *is* a quantity of pleasure that justifies such a torture, says something very important about a person(ethics, or the lack of ethics, in a person, are purely a happenstance that results from traits, which result from genes\/environment).\n\nA common confusion stems from a framing of the ontology\/phenomenology of \"good\" and \"bad\" as equivalent, when \"badness\" is really much worse than \"goodness\" is good. To understand this easily, all one needs to do is become sufficiently acquainted with badness(some people have traits, as a result of adaptations, that cause them to fail to appreciate badness, or ontological concepts, but everyone will grasp the concept beyond a certain threshold of \"bad\"-- some just require more hypothetical, simulated 'torture' than others). We have a world of extremely varied phenomenologies, so we cannot converge on the ethics easily. Some people are hyper sensitive, others are hyper \"dull\", some people have a knack for ontology, others are, again, 'dull'. But again, after a certain threshold of \"bad\" is met, no matter how much \"good\" you get shown(after or before, even though on smaller scales this seems to confuse our intuitions slightly), badness **really** is far more ethically salient than positive valence. \n\nThe tragedy is of course, that if ethical truths exist, and our ethical intuitions cohering with these truths are a genetic dice roll, then several people(perhaps all of humanity?) will be \"ethically impaired\", and this is perfectly compatible with say, devoting one's life to an academic career in a normative ethical system.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1616953132,"distinguished":null,"edited":1616954151.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gslld31","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_lt01x8","locked":false,"name":"t1_gslld31","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_lt01x8","permalink":"\/r\/Utilitarianism\/comments\/lt01x8\/can_lexicographic_preferences_save_negative\/gslld31\/","retrieved_utc":1627298704,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Utilitarianism","subreddit_id":"t5_2revn","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

When someone says, \"Antinatalism is ethical\", what does that mean? What is the approach to the question?\n\nAll of this is clouded in a person's values. Is one more pragmatic, or idealistic? Pragmatists will say something like you said, \"Of **course** you'd be pro-birth in a scenario that saves an entire planet\", but an Idealist is really concerned with something like \"Is it **objectively** true to say \"Antinatalism **is** ethical\", in some absolute sense?

And potentially, given our massive ignorance of the future like you say, we are causing immense moral harm. I think scope sensitivity does a lot of heavy lifting here, in that we are quite good at recognizing the odds being bad for a child who is born at random anywhere on Earth, but we are quite bad at thinking about the consequences of a birth 1million years into the future.

The society doesn't win, the tops of the hierarchy and the bottoms are doomed to impinge on each other in a psychopathic game. The ruler of the society doesn't even win, because they're robbed of a world that *isn't* a mentally ill hellscape-- surely they would benefit from a *better* world?\n\nSo why is *this* the nature of things? The secret is understanding that none of the machinery that causes this, has anything to do with people. People are just vessels for something that obeys a kind of \"script\", and that script is called \"DNA\". The script says: \"Make more copies\". Then the copies which can successfully make yet more copies, are *rewarded*, under the way things currently play out.

Fascinating. \n\n&gt; Though my will is quite \"free\", it is not \"my\" in the sense of \"conscious self\" \u2014 you are confusing identity and awareness.\n\nSo your will is free, just unconsciously. Pardon? Is your will here any different ontologically from the will of a river(no dams in sight, by the way). If not, would the river's will be free if you introduced a high-level consciousness phenomenology? Reminder: No dams to obstruct the river.\n\n&gt; The very invocation of \"my\" (or \"you\") at all, already puts us at an abstraction layer above this conflagration of emergent actions.\n\nYes it does put us at an abstraction above the causal, physical substrate. It is... another, causal, substrate. There is no break in causality here what so ever. Proponents of compatibilism appear to delineate it for some reason, which is bizarre. Is this where the rabbit gets put into the hat?\n\n&gt; When we refer to things as \"my\" this or that, we are using our abstractions of \"self\" as a heuristic for however we navigate such properties; but, it is only a heuristic \u2014 because in truth, our \"self\" is a far deeper set of properties of which our conscious mind is vaguely related.\n\nYes, there's a semantic game people play where they call the phenomenology a \"Self\", or the representational self-image\/model a \"Self\", or the call the physical property a \"Self\", but none of this *matters* given that this is all directly linked in a causal chain, on which, you cannot ever express, either a point, or some other representation, where the will becomes \"Free\". To be *really* free, means to be free from causality. We are not just slightly impinged on by causality, we are **literally** causality. Every single thought you think while reading this is generated via algorithm, aka, not \"chosen freely\", by you. Whether or not you stop reading, determined. Whether you have an emotional response. Determined. Hopefully however you don't fall into the trap of determinism, since all one needs is mere causality( randomness, quanta, whatever-- none of it gets you to freedom). Freedom means the ability to be other than what you are-- it is an incoherent idea. What happens is, this incoherent idea, is the *foisted* onto a semantic game that pretends like the \"free flowing river\" is like the thing with the ability to be other than what one is. If you understand that last sentence, you understand the problem of free will, in a nutshell. \n\nCausality is a broad-form of slavery, it is the opposite of freedom.

Now imagine some phenomenon in life that *stirs* you from the sensation of negative thoughts, emotions, physical feeling.\n\nBRRRING! BRRRRRRRRING! It's the telephone.\n\n\"Hello?\" You say, in a suddenly new voice. As if you're a new person. Your consciousness has suddenly *shifted* away from this 'terrible, neurotic thought pattern'. You politely\/calmly engage on the phone(relatively, to your prior condition), and the call ends.\n\nNow, you either move on to the next thought-- distracted from the negative experience all of a sudden via some short attention span, or you return to the prior neurosis. How bizarre is this? If you really **are** that prior pattern, how can it be that *you*, what is *really* you, somehow **is** that pattern? It just can't be this fluid. What's instead happening is you're the *witness* of a pattern of thought and emotion and sensation, but this holds such a compelling grip that you form an identity around it.\n\nMindfulness is a training that loosens this grip, and therefore alleviates the 1) severity 2) duration and 3) tenacity of psychological suffering. To be well trained in mindfulness is to be able to suddenly \"Receive the phone call\" that shakes you awake, stopping this \"identify with one's thoughts\" habit. The thoughts are still there, but you can calmly investigate them, and therefore lose interest in them if they seem harmful, unproductive, untrue, etc.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1617162020,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gsvmsjg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_md6128","locked":false,"name":"t1_gsvmsjg","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_md6128","permalink":"\/r\/Schizotypal\/comments\/md6128\/what_therapy_stylecoping_mechanisms_has_helped\/gsvmsjg\/","retrieved_utc":1627314073,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizotypal","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlzo","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Constantly afraid, constant uncertainty.\n\nYou may have heard this before, but the core motivation for fear-- the psychology of fear, has a lot to do with the unknown. This is why knowledge is the antidote to fear, and therefore potentially to the negative emotion associated with fear.\n\nUnderstanding now that this toxic parental behavior is an *evolutionary strategy*(It goes without saying that it is a bad one in ethical terms, but **everything** a being does can be thought of as a strategic attempt by definition) can relieve a lot of the trauma related to suffering from it. It can also cause more trauma, so caution is advised.\n\nThe reasoning: If a parent behaves in a psychopathic way towards a child, a way that ensures a stress response is created at the slightest mistake, it forces certain hormones\/chemicals\/brain states. These states condition the child towards seemingly maladaptive disorders: Paranoia, anxiety, depression, etc. However, these are not 'disorders'-- these are unfortunate strategic byproducts of the evolutionary process. They are \"crude survival tools\". In our world today, many of these features express themselves as maladaptive. After all, how could anyone with crippling depression *function* at all? But this ignores the point of depression-- depression's point **is** to not function. It's a kind of \"playing dead\" as a response to a psychopathic hell, a world full of predators, full of danger, full of things that feed off of and rely on \"things to engage with them\". From the genes eye view, the genes say \"It's better to sit paralyzed in bed than to go out there and get abused or worse, killed\" This is the \"genetic logic\" of something like depression, and you can take this gene's eye view exercise to understand *any* disorder better in a way that doesn't frame those suffering from it as necessarily \"failed\" people. Victims of abuse are extremely clever and creative and rich human beings, from my experience.\n\nOf course, at the cost of the genes getting a \"winning strategy\", parents are robbed of ever having a healthy, loving relationships with their children, and children are robbed of ever having the parents they deserve(No child *deserves* to be randomly thrown into a narcissistic abuse scenario-- recognize how the idea that an innocent child could deserve something like this is *absurd*) because the genes express themselves in abusive trait-sets like narcissism, psychopathy, bpd, etc. \n\nThe result is, everyone loses, but the genes win. Is this depressing itself? Yes. But this is knowledge. Knowledge is the antidote to fear, because in shedding light on the exact machinery, it's torturous nature can't traumatize us.

We're not talking about what someone subjectively feels, I don't give a fuck if subjectively someone thinks they can levitate. I care about what they are as subjects in **objective** terms. They cannot levitate, they cannot make a free choice. I don't need to know a single thing about your specific brain to know you have precisely zero freedom, as an **objective** claim about reality.\n\n&gt;UNTIL that space is solved, and we generate, or unlock, new uncertainty space that free will contains itself within.\n\nI think I understand your position now. You're pretending like some layer in causality process exists in a vacuum. This is a confusion. Everything is impinged on via a causal chain, including your sense you can perform an action freely. Everything. The implication of this, is that you have no freedom. The implication of that, is that criminal justice is a shitshow to anyone who isn't a psychopath or expresses the psychology of some other domination machine. This is the *purpose* of the meme of free will. Free will was *invented* so that the peasant could be shot down when they realized, \"Wait a second.. the fact that the King receives daily champagne enemas while I\"m starving is... totally arbitrary. The King isn't special, the king didn't exhibit some special \"thing\" to become King, he's just a fucking robot like me, and the fact that one of us lives a life of shit and pain and the other doesn't all while everyone is told they're \"Free\" is sort of a complete fucking farce, no? There's nothing the king did to *earn* his \"special\" spot in reality, nor am I blameworthy for my deeply miserable spot in reality.\" \n\nKing: \"You have free will, sorry :)\"\n\nThe king is evolutionarily predisposed to be **allergic** to the fact of no free will, because it's a function of his psychopathy. King-hood is **synonymous** with psychopathy, by definition, it's a domination strategy. Anyone who *cannot* understand the impossibility of free will is not exposing some insight about reality, they're performing an evolutionary narrative that allows them to have zero issues with a hellish meat grinder of domination robots. Free will opens to door to tell the peasant: \"You *are* blameworthy\" in a world where the peasant is *literally* a slave to causality, and that is the Kafkaesque shitshow free-willers and compatibilists defend, all while fellating the King, ultimately, because even the compatibilists tragically lose in the process.\n\nImagine being in a world of *literal* domination robots. But first, notice if you *don't* fulfill this request with total honesty and openness-- right now. Exercise your free will right now and pay *hyper* close attention to any aversion to the request of exploring a thought experiment that, if entertained with total honesty, validates the idea that free will is nonsense. Notice the aversion? That's a *function* of your psychology. Refused to notice? Again, a *function* of your psychology. What does this say *about* you?).\n\nThe idea:\n\nYou find yourself in a world of cartoony things that just beep boop and enslave you because they're physically stronger, and just randomly torture you and go against your interests at all times. This is a hellworld, clearly. When you protest(all you can do is verbalize your disgust and displeasure, it's the only available strategy as a social monkey to these cold sociopathic machines)-- The robots reply: \"YOU HAVE FREE WILL. WE HAVE FREE WILL.\" \"BEEP. BOOP.\" The robot even has an \"inner narrative\"\/abstraction, identical in all the important ways to human phenomenology. They believe everyone has free will. But of course, any moron understands that they're just robots, running on a script, which is also what any organic DNA based robot is.\n\nReminder: What does it mean to not *fully* fulfill the request, intellectually? How would a psychopath tackle the request of this thought experiment? How would a caring, deeply curious, deeply unpsychopathic person go about this request? Notice the difference, notice what it *says* about the people in these distinctions. What are all the ways to miss a point here?\n\n&gt; As opposed to what? Some imaginary universe that can't logically exist?\n\nWe're free, because being free is impossible, therefore, since a universe where freedom is possible, is completely incoherent, we're... free!\n\n:)\n\n(freely written statement, freely flowing atoms, freely firing neurons, freely moved fingers, freely actuated keystrokes-- forget the fact that I couldn't possibly have done otherwise, or that you couldn't possibly react in a way other than how you will react when you get to the end of this sentence)\n\nWhat psychology does this freedom of yours prop up again, remind me?","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1617204461,"distinguished":null,"edited":1617206770.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gsx9pnb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mfpo2q","locked":false,"name":"t1_gsx9pnb","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_gsv0i9b","permalink":"\/r\/samharris\/comments\/mfpo2q\/scott_barry_kaufman_and_those_confused_about_free\/gsx9pnb\/","retrieved_utc":1627316582,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"samharris","subreddit_id":"t5_2thqg","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

This is an intuitive idea for anyone, no prior knowledge in game theory required. Simply think of a sport, and now think of a star athlete in that sport. Pretend you have a simulated sandbox environment where this athlete plays vs. copies of themselves, endlessly. Now, we edit one of these athletes, let's call them \"Evil Star\", to instead *cheat* in the game. Evolutionary processes will allow \"Evil Star\" to cheat better and better, because they only improve with time. There is no referee in this special game(to mirror the fact that there is no ultimate referee on Earth, no God to punish evil people, no Alien Mothership full of benevolent aliens to stop humanity before they do something truly insane, saying \"Bup bup bup! That's enough! You guys are evil!\"-- No such limitations exist). The \"Evil Star\" would obviously get a higher score in this game over time, right? They're identically as skilled, but they simply have access to more \"moves\". This means that the most evil strategies will beat the good strategies in our universe.\n\nWhy? Because the evil strategies can do **everything** the good strategies can do, *plus* cheat. Good is bound by rules, by definition. It's bound by what one *cannot* do: Evil. Evil is bound by nothing, other than \"Win\". This is what is rewarded in our world: Stuff that tries to win. Therefore, evil dominates reality.\n\nThe end result is the world you see: humans seem as psychopathic as they do to you, because the entire evolutionary system promotes this behavior as a strategy to make more copies of DNA. This is a tragedy for everyone-- it's a tragedy for victims, because they exist in a world of pointless suffering, but it is also a tragedy for the superficial \"winners\", whose \"reward\" is a world that is a psychopathic hellscape-- something they would want to avoid, if they could, but they paradoxically cannot understand this problem due to their own nature as \"winners\".\n\n&gt;A bit beyond perception's reach\n\n&gt;I sometimes believe I see\n\n&gt;that life is two locked boxes\n\n&gt; each containing the other's key.\n\n\u2014 Piet Hein","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1617229868,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gsysq86","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mhe06c","locked":false,"name":"t1_gsysq86","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_mhe06c","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/mhe06c\/people_are_evil_so_why_should_we_socialise\/gsysq86\/","retrieved_utc":1627319034,"score":10,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

One does not need to for instance, roam through the streets shouting: \"Hey guys! We're all in literal hell, by the way!\"(a proposition I believe to be true).
