Use something that could conceivably used to make chai. Don't try to make chai with lipton bags.\n* Sweetended condensed milk is a quick replacement for the process the use in India, boiling milk down with sugar. It gives chai a nice creamy body. A splash of heavy cream or half and half will improve how luxurious your chai is.\n\n  \nBoil your tea and spices with the goal of creating something akin to coffee which will have milk\/cream\/sugar added. This means you want a \\*strong\\* brew. Taste every minute or so until you've boiled something that tastes like it'll take the milk\/cream\/sugar well. My final tip is to aerate your Chai. You can do this by pouring between 2 cups as they do in India, or if you have one of those metal cocktail shakers, shake up your chai(This wont work with hot chai, do not burn yourself!). A good blender works for a hot beverage, but please put a towel over it and don't fill it beyond the halfway point of the blender.

And yeah, here's the reason I don't feel like a fraud at all. I don't feel like a failure. I don't feel like I've done anything shameful. This is despite having no job, no friends, no college degree, not wanting to live on, nothing that would traditionally be seen as markers for a successful life. I've done one thing that I consider to be a tremendous personal success. And that is, I've managed to survive a life time of malignant abuse at the hands of a woman who, as it turned out, wouldn't let me turn into a functional adult. I emerged from the experience of being the son of a criminally abusive person, coherent. I'm able to reflect on my life and say it was too much. I understand her abuse well. I understand it's impact on me, and understand it was the primary driver of an unsuccessful life. I understand that success in life is largely the outcome of variables which you do not control - Your parents, your genes, your environment, your luck - the person you become in life is formed by these variables. I consider myself incredibly unlucky.\n\n\nI feel the same is true for you. Even if you're tempted to tell yourself something like \"I don't have it so bad\", it doesn't change the fact that you couldn't have acted any differently than you happened to act - that doesn't change. Once you acknowledge that you couldn't have thought or acted in a way other than how you acted, you are liberated. It no longer makes sense to feel shame. Things like regret, only serve as a tool to learn from, but the sort of dwelling in deep dissatisfaction as if you could have done otherwise in past events, stops making sense.

Why does the taboo of death exist? Clearly it was an idea distributed in religious language up until a few recent decades(God created your life, and only he can take it away), but the true origin of why voluntary death is not allowed is far more sinister. You have to understand this from the perspective of nations, or those in power. The world is a massive competition. So as a country, you're in competition with other countries. If you aren't better than another country, you get dominated and lose the game. How do you win the game? For starters, by being rich. How can you be rich? By maximally exploiting your populace and their money. Your populace are essentially cows. The problem is, if cows could choose, they wouldn't want to become milk slaves, that isn't in their interest. But it's in the interest of the farmer. And the farmer is in charge, so here we are. What would happen if a cow said... \n\n\"I'm leaving. And I'm never coming back. This is hell. I would rather not live that live another second here.\"\n\nWell.. the farmer would laugh. The farmer would say, \"Sorry, but I'm in charge. You're not allowed to leave. We will make it very clear here that if anyone leaves, there will be very big trouble. Pretend that in this analogy the cows ability to produce milk is only limited to them being alive - disease, old age, none of this prevents the cow from producing milk. Infact, often disease and old age make this cow produce more milk(disease and old age in humans mean mounting medical bills, $$$ = Milk). This means the cows pay a terrible price - it means that even the worst suffering imaginable means they're forced to stay alive and produce milk. The cow could beg for death, and you're still not allowed - **You must produce milk.**\n\nThe problem is incentive. The farmer is incentivized to care more about milk than anything else, because if he doesn't, the other farmers are just going to win. So policy, culture, laws, etc are created to support that incentive.
