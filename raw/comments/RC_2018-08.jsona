I think forgiveness should be reserved for those who can feel like they did something wrong. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me to forgive someone with no empathy, because forgiveness to me means \"I'm okay with the fact that you did what you did because I know you didn't mean it. I know the circumstances were rough for you, and I know it won't be the same way in the future\". Something along those lines.\n\nThat doesn't make sense to do with a narcissist. However...\n\nThere's a ton of needless psychological trauma fed by the resent towards your abuser. It's haunting. That I think, has to be tackled in order to heal. You cannot go seething in hatred for the person who hurt you so much, because then they will permanently have a hold on you. And I've discovered a way to combat this psychological trauma, just by reasoning it out. Here goes:\n\nA narcissist is basically someone who is very unlucky. If we had the option of pressing a button to permanently become narcissists, no mentally healthy person would ever press the button, right? No one wants to be totally self absorbed. No one wants to manipulate everyone they get involved with. No one wants to cause that much misery, right? So to be born into the circumstances that causes the personality disorder to manifest - is to be **unlucky** just as it is to be born into the circumstances of having a narcissist as a parent. We didn't chose to be their children, but they also didn't choose to acquire a personality disorder. We don't have to know if it's too much attention or if it's severe neglect or the wrong genes that causes the mental illness, we just have to know that **something** causes it. Once it's there, a narcissist will be helpless to behave like a narcissist, just like a psychopath will be helpless to behave like a psychopath, and a bear will be helpless to be behave like a bear. And just like a bear, a narcissist can ruin your life if you cross paths with it. But also like a bear, it doesn't make sense to hate a bear forever - they were just being a bear, doing bear things. Now, with humans, just to be clear, it doesn't mean that the things that mentally ill humans do are ever okay or should be tolerated because that's how their brains are wired. Like I wrote earlier, they are **unforgivable** if you ask me. They are so bad that we're never going to say \"Oh, they're just *being* themselves acting like narcissists!\". We still want to lock up narcissists who behave in criminally abusive ways. But once you understand that narcissism is just a problem of human psychology, you see them more like dangerous animals than as people capable of being forgiven or worthy of hatred. And that is very conducive to healing from my experience. The key is understanding that they couldn't have acted otherwise, much like you couldn't, if you were able to press the \"Turn into a Narcissist right now\" button.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1533684240,"distinguished":null,"edited":1533684561,"gilded":0,"id":"e3sklok","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_95eprf","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_95eprf","permalink":"\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/95eprf\/whats_everyones_opinion_on_forgiveness_of_your\/e3sklok\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1537192018,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_type":"public"}

The one of the most valuable approaches can be to Grey rock. \n\nhttps:\/\/www.aconsciousrethink.com\/6158\/gray-rock-method-dealing-narcissist\/\n\nEar buds are a great way to drown out the mental illness . I recommend the howard leight laser lite or max-1 earplugs, you can find them on amazon. If you have money to invest into good quality ear buds so you can put music and isolate outside sound, Etymotic MC5 has very good noise isolation. You can put an audiobook or music on, and it will silence the narcissist. \n\nRemember, the strategy is always asking yourself, \"How can I deal with this with the most *minimal* interaction?\"\n\nIs it possible to deal with some situations without any words? Do that then. Is one word needed? Say yes or no, or even better - only nod or shake your head, and return to minimizing interaction. Try to get better and better at this, with the ultimate goal of being as uninteresting(and often unconversational) as possible. This is something you have to sort of test out on your own. Some people can do total silence and the N will stop. Other times, the N behaves worse and worse because they hate being ignored. Maybe it's worth it, maybe it's not.\n\nRemember, you are not dealing with a person who you can talk to and reason with who understands your concerns - normal conversation is usually impossible, which is the hardest part for some victims to learn. You are dealing with something more like a dangerous animal who cannot see they are harming you.

Imagine two scenarios:\n\n\n1) Imagine an otherwise psychologically healthy adult, with say, a family they care about, stuck in some position in life where their family is locked down, and this person endures the worst humiliation and abuse just to provide income for his family on a daily basis. Suppose this is the level of psychological abuse that can be found in the most clever torturer cases the world has ever seen, and this person is just broken to the point that they wake up each day begging for death, knowing that they cannot love their family, knowing that they're in a part of the world where there is no system of justice to resolve this situation, are forced to pretend life is okay to shelter them, and life is just an exquisite hell. This sort of person may very well need to die from an ethical perspective. This may be the only humane avenue available, but this person has no incentive whatsoever to psychologically traumatize any one. They are not necessarily lashing out at the world, they want to spare as many people from the trauma of chosen death as possible.\n\n2) Now imagine someone who cannot be described in psychological terms as \"Otherwise healthy\". The \"bad luck\" here really does involve things like abuse, things like neurological and psychological damage over their entire lives to the point that they can no longer make sense of life in way example 1 can. They cannot simply see life as absurdly cruel, and find this fact sad, but there's other software running that causes them to be unable to consider other people. This person could have a propensity for violence, a lack of empathy, a self absorbed attitude, and so on and there's nothing about this that can't be mapped on to all the bad luck of example 1. It's just another form of bad luck. But the person in example 1 can look at the person in example 2 and say \"That person really is missing something.\" They're missing something because they have additional issues going on that rob them of humanity, and rob them of the ability to analyze their reality in a clear minded way that is only possible by added psychological\/neurological damage throughout life.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1534010693,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"id":"e40og18","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_930ipm","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_930ipm","permalink":"\/r\/FreeToGo\/comments\/930ipm\/a_fundemental_difference_in_thought\/e40og18\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1537367688,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"FreeToGo","subreddit_id":"t5_ke9tj","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/FreeToGo","subreddit_type":"public"}

Most damaged people have to admit they aren't in a great position to raise children. The key to being equipped to raise kids is having lots of good people to serve as examples, bad people serving as examples of what not to do, tends to lead to a rubberbanding effect where compensation occurs for an area of neglect; starved children become parents that allow or even encourage gluttony and vice versa, criticized children become parents that overly shelter their children from any negative feedback creating dysfunctional people, and so on.

How that affected her behavior, I don't quite remember, but I remember that it did *something*. She continued to rant and rave, I just wasn't going to get baited into more arguments so I tried to ignore her.\n\nLately, I did it after falling into the trap of feeding her narcissistic supply very heavily for a period of over a year, stupidly expecting fairness from her. Once she acted in a ridiculously malicious way to me that I thought was unacceptable even for a lifelong victim of abuse, which is what caused the mask fully came off, at age 33, and I don't think I'll ever look at her differently from that point. This took... 6 or so years of reading about narcissistic abuse, the rest of my life was merely a \"Something has to be wrong here\" feeling. I couldn't escape her because she crippled me to perfection. Not something that I can admit without being looked down upon to anyone outside of this community, though - no one would believe you and you'd be ridiculed for the idea and called lazy.\n\nSo these last few months, 6-7 months, I shut off all N-supply. I would not even answer simple questions. I would not even respond to very basic, common decency requests. I owed her absolutely nothing, even in ways that would be unfair towards another person. If i saw her food burning on the stove, I would not help, for instance.\n\nAnd the very first thing she did, as a person who very rarely speaks on the phone, is begin calling everyone in her little phone book. Old friends. Family in another country. Everyone. She would make trips to the grocery store and pick on some poor kid stocking vegetables and torture him with her life story(I caught her doing this one day because I happened to go grab some bottled water). She would also expose her self to me on a daily basis, something I always hear about here but rarely encountered as a kid, either by wearing very revealing clothing, or just flat out walking around naked in the kitchen and things like that. She did anything for attention. Made noise on purpose, anything. And as she continued to not get attention, she just broke down after a while. Screamed her lungs out, threw my cloths on the floor near my room, laid there and had a tantrum talking to her deceased father and pretending to cry.\n\nI don't know if it worked, because lately I've been arguing with her because shes been especially malicious.

And because physiological needs are a problem our world is tackling now, I think there just aren't any resources to go around until physiological needs are met. I mean, psychological needs have been all but solved once you reach a certain economic threshold, but we're talking about for every human here, just to be clear. The wealthier you are, the more access you have to sex and even romance, clearly, and it's been that way since money entered into the picture. So since the problem of food and health and shelter are nowhere near solved, I strongly doubt psychological needs will get solved for the downtrodden of the 1st world any time soon. \n\nTo say that sex is a \"fundamental\" need is beginning to mince words, because the fundamentals are the physiological needs. Everything above that are still needs. They just aren't fundamental needs, which are needs that meaningfully put survival at risk. It can be tempting to form some argument along the lines of \"But not getting any sex can make one suicidal, thereby putting survival at risk, making it a fundamental need\", but this reaction varies from person to person. I think the real \"risk\" in that scenario more involves a misunderstanding of why the world is the way it is(ie, thinking the world is evil all day and hating it). I'm not a virgin, but I certainly don't get laid, and I don't see myself killing myself over not getting sex. So basically not getting sex certainly makes you a sad person, without a doubt, much like not getting to live in a nice home does, or not getting decent internet access, or not getting to eat the food that the rich can eat, but none of these things should in principle make one kill themselves, there have to be other compounding ideas operating for that to happen.

Tea purists generally go for Chinese or Japanese style of drinking, but you just have to explore. You'll want to avoid tea bags and anything containing things which aren't actually tea if you're a purist, just to save you the headache. There is a tea equivalent of a \"hazelnut caramel mocha frappe\" and anything similar, and that's sort of the majority in the western tea market.\n\nI would start with a Gaiwan, and then samplers. The best sampler on offer in my personal experience is on Dazzle-deer, for several reasons. They're a small curator vendor, who is small enough to be able to package their good quality traditional Chinese teas into tiny , single serving samples. They have a special package where you can just pick any teas that sound interesting to you, and the variety of tea types they offer is quite large so in a single order you can really get a varied sense of what Chinese loose leaf tea is all about. This is all for a cost that I personally have not found a better deal on(roughly 20-30 USD shipped) while browsing the vendors out there, in terms of quality to price ratio. There are many popular vendors out there and you can't really go wrong per se, unless the vendor is **too** popular, then you can run into some trouble sometimes. No matter who you choose, small and committed to quality is your best bet.\n\nAs for the Gaiwan, you can knock 2 birds with one stone by picking up the cheapest thing your tea vendor has on offer, or you can go to a specialized vendor like teaware.house. They have some decent looking gaiwans at decent prices for western standards.\n\nEdit: I just read your responses that you're not in the US. I think you have to scratch the DazzleDeer advice, then. Another person suggested What-cha, and I think they're the closest thing you have in the EU to the vendor I suggested, so they would be my first choice as a newbie. Mei leaf is a great guy and has great teas, and is a very passionate vendor that ships internationally and is based in UK, but unless funds for a fairly expensive hobby are unlimited to you, I cannot recommend him as a vendor.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1534439411,"distinguished":null,"edited":1534445608,"gilded":0,"id":"e4aws3l","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_97mxgs","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_97mxgs","permalink":"\/r\/tea\/comments\/97mxgs\/i_drink_good_coffee_im_teacurious_what_do_you\/e4aws3l\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1537609403,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"tea","subreddit_id":"t5_2qq5e","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/tea","subreddit_type":"public"}

The first is the way most people, and the field of psychology understands sociopaths and psychopaths. To say someone is either of those things, they need a truly terminal case of the traits that represent those conditions. But the reality is far more nuanced than that. I would argue we're *all* sociopaths, psychopaths, and narcissists to some pathological degree. Indeed, all 7 billion of us alive today are the descendants of those who had the least empathy, not the most. We are the descendants of the people who would most easily resort to violence, not those who were pacifists. We are the descendants of the best liars, not the worst. \n\nSo the way I'm using those words describes the full \"Pulse\" of humanity's antisocial traits, rather than specific people who display them to the highest degree. \n\nThe second answer I have to that is, and this is just my own personal speculation and intuition, I don't believe science and the field of psychology has sufficiently controlled for the deceptive nature of something like psychopathy from being accurately detected. What I'm saying is that because the condition describes those of us on the planet that are best at blending in, being manipulators, being powerful, and so on, it is far more difficult to get an accurate sense of who these people are\/what percentage of them make up our species, because part of the set of traits is by definition evading detection.

Antinatalism essentially says that because suffering is possible, consciousness should not be allowed. This is what you just alluded to, when you pointed out that because a life of misery is *possible at all* is the reason for antinatalism.\n\nTo believe that though, you have to ignore the alternative conclusion to that line of thinking. Which is, \"Because a life of profound insight and wellbeing and flourishing and joy is possible at all, consciousness should be allowed.\"\n\nThis is the exact same argument, except in the other direction. Now sometimes you encounter this idea that even one person suffering invalidates the wellbeing and existence of 1 billion people, or something along those lines. Earlier you wrote:\n\n&gt; You think those tiny glimmers of joy, which by the way are not guaranteed, would outweigh the misery of their life.. to THEM?\n\nNotice how not at all tempted you were to use the same logic in the other direction, even though this is what it would mean to be logically consistent on this issue? \"You think glimmers of suffering, which aren't even guaranteed,\" etc etc.\n\n\nYou can do this sort of parallel logic with just about every antinatalist argument, but you never see an antinatalist do it. And that is because there's just a compulsive and extreme aversion to risk going on with this philosophical position. Saying that no suffering is allowed because any at all can occcur, is along the lines of saying \"Let's set the speed limit at 5 miles an hour, and we'll ensure that almost no one suffers from automobile accidents.\" Or better yet \"Ban all cars\" or \"Don't go outside\" or \"Ban amusement parks, because we can certain that some number of people , and children, will have horrific accidents in them\/die on rides\". And it's often from a very personal psychological level. People suffer greatly, and then they rationalize a ban on all suffering.

I notice your account has a post history of 3 or 4 posts.\n\nEdit: I now understand what bugged me so much about someone being \"unable to recommend\" a book that essentially says we need to be careful about how our ideologies shape the world, and be careful about how in our current world, the powerful become more powerful, and the weak become weaker, and suggesting this trend is about to continue exponentially, and that this, along with all other global concerns, should unify humanity.\n\nSo here's the mystery, now solved: The book's author Yuval Noah Harari is not a proponent of moral or cultural relativism. Some cultures really are worse than others, according to him. Some actions really are wrong, according to him. In certain fields of science, particularly in(but not exclusive to) Anthropology , there's a strong adherence to the idea of cultural relativism to this day, and this has been plaguing this field and others for decades now. From the point of view of a cultural relativist, if we discovered a culture somewhere in 2018 that ritualistically raped children, that wouldn't necessarily be \"Right or wrong\", it would just be another flavor of culture. Likewise, in Islam, if the culture decides that they want to cut away the clitorises of young girls, that's not misogyny and psychopathy, that's just another flavor of culture which we are in no position to criticize. Yuval Noah Harari, and the modern western intellectual movement today disagree with this. And as a result, in the last few years there's been a genuine smear campaign of intellectuals who suggest that cultural relativism or moral relativism is bogus. This is why Steven Pinker is mentioned in this thread as a source that isn't credible, as well - He is on the hit list of people who will do anything to discredit him to continue their war of ideas.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1534694259,"distinguished":null,"edited":1535046495,"gilded":0,"id":"e4gtjoz","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_98j7u8","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_e4gj3a1","permalink":"\/r\/books\/comments\/98j7u8\/just_finished_sapiens_and_homo_deus_what_do_you\/e4gtjoz\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1537708700,"score":10,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"books","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh4i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/books","subreddit_type":"public"}

Capitalism is really easy to see the flaw of - the bottom rungs of society get brutalized under this system, no one can argue against that. No \"trickling down\" to be found, if you look at the most successful capitalist societies you'll almost always find a brutalized lower class. The freer the market, the more brutalized the poor become.\n\nSocialism, on the other hand... was a tricky one. What could be the problem with something that professed to help the poor? It seemed like the obvious antithesis to the flaws of capitalism. 20th century attempts at socialism all resulted in murder, but... does that necessarily mean socialism is inherently bad? That common argument didn't ever really satisfy me. Until I finally felt like I figured it out:\n\n\n**Neither system is intrinsically destructive for the poor, but both inevitably destroy the poor**\n\nSocialism fails for the precise reason that Capitalism fails - People are rotten. And in the case of socialism, the true reason for why it fails, ... the kicker you've been waiting for.... is the people who implement socialism, who profess empathy for the poor, actually instead **hate the rich**. It's for this reason, and this reason alone, that socialist systems fail. There's no socialist system in history that was ever \"too generous\" to the poor, because the poor were never a consideration. It is about making sure no one is rich, resenting the rich, and it only ever exists as a solution to the \"problem of wealth\" rather than what it claims to be, \"the problem of poverty\". \n\nCapitalism with heavy regulation and heavy social safety nets is currently the best system we have for an ethical world that still makes progress, but of course, the incentives just aren't there to employ such a system for world powers, because if one country becomes too generous to their poor, another country will have an edge over it. So it really is a race to see who can be more anti-social to it's citizenry(without breaking) in the name of progress and competition.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1535342369,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"id":"e4we663","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_9a01go","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_9a01go","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/9a01go\/are_there_any_communists_here\/e4we663\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1537970447,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public"}

I'm not opposed to assisted suicide, it has to be implemented, so if you're confusing me for a pro-life advocate you're arguing against something that isn't there. But the idea of suicide booths, I think, are only attractive as a fantasy to someone who is severely depressed and begging for death. It's so easy to sell yourself this idea when you want nothing more than to die at this very moment. \n\nDo you think it's controversial to deny a 12 year old the right to die? What about the right to smoke crack cocaine? \n\nYou appear to be completely unappreciative of just how mind states can color ones rationality. Here's the thought experiment you can run to test this intuition: \n\nImagine someone who told you that they believe a child should be free to engage in extremely gorey self-harm. So this person believes that if we find a 10 year old, say, just slicing away at his own thighs and arms, we should look at it and say \"Whelp... nothing we can really do if this kid wants to do what he wants to do. He's merely exercising his freedom. His body, his choice.\"\n\nAnd you discover the person expressing this idea, happens to have had a deeply traumatic life that causes the sorts of compulsive self-harm he or she advocates for. This person isn't exactly an authority on the ethics of the right to self harm. This person has plenty of valuable insights into what a traumatized and tortured existence feels like, but we don't want this person setting the rules for the age of liberty to cut into your flesh for the purpose of coping with stress. This person simply lacks the alternative scope of what it's like to not live a tortured life, and how policy should be set. We need both perspectives if we want a rational, sane system.\n\nIf you can grasp this concept, then you've already grasped the problem with a person advocating total, unrestricted freedom for suicide. Is a severely depressed, suicidal person someone with a valuable perspective on just how bad life can get? Sure. But that's not the full picture. They also have colored their view in such a way that if we let them create policy, damage can be done. That's something we want to avoid. Do we want to live in a world where the people who suffer most tremendously, and have exhausted all options, should die? Absolutely. We are currently very far from this world. But it certainly doesn't help the right-to-die cause when people don't acknowledge that it's possible for someone to act in ways that don't actually maximize their self interests. All one have to do is stop pretending that everyone knows exactly what's good for them. It's possible to be delusional about your own need to die. It's possible to simply be a kid who has no idea just how bad their life is. Is it possible to be a child who happens to genuinely be suffering terribly? Yes, of course. But childhood happens to have in it an intrinsic property that allows for dramatic changes to occur. This is why we say a child isn't \"developed\", and this is why we don't allow children to do many of things we don't allow them to do. Words actually have meanings here, and reality is not purely open to whatever your interpretation makes you feel good or bad.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1535560348,"distinguished":null,"edited":1535560787,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"id":"e51kqwd","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_9b5bbn","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_e51j6vk","permalink":"\/r\/FreeToGo\/comments\/9b5bbn\/suicide_is_a_human_right\/e51kqwd\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1538057540,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"FreeToGo","subreddit_id":"t5_ke9tj","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/FreeToGo","subreddit_type":"public"}

It doesn't matter how free you feel. The objective reality suggests that you have absolutely no free will, that every single thought and action you perform is deterministic, in accordance with the rest of the deterministic, feeling, thinking, meat things. \n\nThe entire reason for the free will argument stems from individual psychology, not from ability in understanding philosophical arguments. It's very much like how personality colors your politics, a la Johnathan Haidt's work. In my view, Free will is no different; your psychology and personality will color your view on free will. \n\nIf you feel some strong pull to the idea of \"ego\" , or the idea that you really deserve everything you have in life, strongly subscribe to individuality, or that you've truly \"earned\" things you enjoy today, if your sense of self absorbs you more than the average person, you are almost doomed to be unable to relate to the idea that you don't actually have free will.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have low attachment to the self, you're actually interested in losing the ego, perhaps have dabbled in psychedelics or meditation and have first hand experience of what it's like to lose the ego, the idea of no free will becomes far more intuitive. \n\nYou're never going to resolve free will with philosophical arguments much like you won't resolve opposing political ideologies with arguments.

She cannot change, because she has the brain of a narcissist. It's important to realize at some point, that whether or not someone *becomes* a narcissist is really just an accident. You had to have bad luck, bad genes, a bad upbringing, these are the *sorts* of things that turn a toddler, into a child at risk of narcissism, into an adult with narcissism.\n\nIf you or I had the brain of a narcissist, we too would be negative, selfish, childish, manipulative, lacking in empathy, and so on. We're lucky in some sense that we can know what it's like to *not* be totally self absorbed and indifferent to the pain of others beyond the extent that it relates to ourselves.\n\nWhat I described above is the next step to healing. Acknowledge she can't change, then acknowledge she was simply unlucky. This doesn't mean she isn't a monster. This doesn't mean be kind to her, or treat her like a normal person. Just like a dangerous animal, like a wild mountain lion, it's someone or something you wish to avoid. Narcissists and mountain lions are dangerous to human health. But it makes little sense to spend all of your life *hating* a mountain lion who ruined your life. It's extremely psychologically taxing and harmful to do this. The antidote to years of damage of this type, is to accept that the mountain lion was just doing mountain lion things. This is the key, from my personal experience, to complete healing and psychological wellbeing.\n\nI hope everything works out for you.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1535663639,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"id":"e54bu0q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_9bmu46","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_9bmu46","permalink":"\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/9bmu46\/ive_accepted_she_wont_change\/e54bu0q\/","removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1538497836,"score":7,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_type":"public"}
