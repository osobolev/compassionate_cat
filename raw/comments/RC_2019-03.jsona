Claiming that it is all a quaint paradox, doesn\u2019t make it any less contradictory.\n\nNo proponent of determinism argues you can't make choices, there's a language game being played here (perhaps intellectually dishonestly, perhaps not) by the author with the word \"choice\". When determinists say \"choice\", they simply mean \"an action taken\". Obviously, actions must be taken. The core question is, can they be taken *meaningfully*, as in, can you truly author them? If you read any arguments explaining why human brains can't really make choices(Concepts such as being in a universe governed by causal physics at every level, having a collective unconsciousness, being completely blind as to your actual desires, intentions, memories, as the Psychological literature supports ad nauseam, etc). There's no contradiction in understanding you have to make choices(not the kind of authored choices in the Free Will narrative, of course) and understanding that you live in a deterministic world.\n\n&gt; And then when he talks about the criminal justice system and moral responsibility, things continue to be a little bit self-contradictory. He wants to sell us the benefits of giving up our notion of free will, whilst persuading us that we can still keep hold of our ideas about moral responsibility and our custom of imprisoning people for crimes.\n\nAgain, I'm failing to see the contradiction in understanding that criminals are simply unlucky people, with unlucky parents, with unlucky genes, with unlucky upbringings, and most often, unlucky pre-frontal cortexes. If the author of this article had read the passages that gradually broke down the notion of luck and neurology(The parallel between brain tumors and non-tumor induced psychopathology is what I'm referring to), I feel like this concept shouldn't be too hard to understand.\n\n&gt; when we ask ourselves the questions whether we have free will, or not; whether we are entirely determined, or not; and what the consequences are if we answer these questions either way, we have to be on our guard against wanting so hard to answer them in a certain way merely in order to fulfil psychological needs that we blind ourselves against weaknesses in our thinking.\n\nThis was the first paragraph of the article and it's the warmest as far as understanding the Free Will vs. Determinism problem. I personally suspect it has to do with something similar of Jon Haidt's work on political affiliation and big 5 personality traits. If you're unfamiliar, he basically demonstrated that personality traits like conscientiousness and openness can predict political leanings. I think it's very much the same with Free Will\/Determinism. The sorts of personality traits that would incentivize belief in Free Will and rejection of Determinism seem to be Ego-related. The kind of person who feels they *really* earned something because of their skill or aptitude, and has a strong merit-based ethical representation of the world, should in theory be highly averse to the idea that everything it's just a massive billiards table within the universe and they didn't *really* author any of their thoughts, success, and achievements. Likewise, someone who is on the opposite spectrum personality wise, or perhaps someone who experienced tremendous bad luck would be far more incentivized psychologically to adopt a Determinist view. \n\nHilariously, what better evidence could there be in psychological terms for there being no Free will, if your personality traits could *predict* whether you believe in it or not?","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1553233581,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ej3l6k6","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_b2j76j","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_b2j76j","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/b2j76j\/sam_harris_confusion_on_free_will_and_determinism\/ej3l6k6\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1556466290,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

That out of the way, the point is that the individual seems to ignore the overbearing force of the interests of some combination of collective tribal unconscious, or conscious interests of the ruling class of each tribe. I've been browsing r\/antinatalism for some time now, and the bewilderment as to why conditions are the way they are is endless, and if there is no bewilderment, there is often confusion. \"People are *merely* selfish and thoughtless.\" Well ...no? It's not that simple? You happen to live in a complex structure where you're closer to a farm animal than you imagine.\n\nThe question isn't why is it so hard to grasp that individuals within a tribe don't want to play a farm animal game, the question is why is it so hard for the farm animals to grasp that they're farm animals.\n\nEdit: Small addition, because that last bit may have sounded not perfectly descriptive of what I mean. I don't mean to say that everything about the way society is structured is terrible. Sheep are domesticated animals, and are *essentially* our slaves as inferior creatures. We exploit them to our hearts desire, we decide how they mate, how often, we kill them when we need them to die. But it's true that they enjoy certain benefits from being domesticated, such as food, shelter, protection from predators, etc. One can argue about what's better, but both the horrible truth of sheep being an inferior species for us to utterly dominate, and the silver lining of certain benefits they gain are indisputable. Likewise, with most of human societies, there are downsides and upsides, but the way people on this subreddit speak, would the the same way some talking sheep would discuss sheep problems as if there was no farmer or that the role of the farmer was somehow just in the periphery. The state of sheep problems **only** make sense, if you look at them from the perspective of the one dominating all sheep on planet earth - Humans.

You can stop resenting other human beings. You can stop \"punishing\" people for circumstances they didn't create.

You can play this word game with any of the more boot-strappy elements of our predicament. \n\nThe idea that you somehow author your thoughts before you think them\/before they influence behavior, in a universe governed either by determinism or randomness doesn't get you free will no matter which combination of determinism or randomness you'd like to calibrate.

If the answer is no -- if you would behaved and thought in precisely the same way if we rewound the universe and hit play 10 to the billion times for good measure, then you have no free will whatsoever. The alternative, is you would have behaved differently due to a universe that contains randomness. Again, randomness doesn't get you meaningful choice.

It's also incompatible with the colossal psychological literature that suggests people tend to have absolutely no idea 1) What they prefer 2) Who they really are 3) The way in which they will react to events 4) Why they behaved the way they did in past events. 5) How favorably\/unfavorably they remember experiences vs. how they were experienced in reality, and a truly endless amount of other data suggesting humans are simply complicated robots. You do not direct the course of your neurons, neurochemistry, you do not choose if you develop a brain tumor that alters your behavior, you don't choose your intelligence, you don't choose your environment and parents and peer groups as a child, which all shape the person you become, and endless more causal factors which shape every single thing about \"you\" right now. The closer one inspects the deterministic nature of the world, human psychology, and neuroscience, the more painfully obvious it becomes that there is actually not a single drop of freedom to be found. Show me a single choice you authored, and I will show you prior causes that **determined** that choice. And even if I cannot do it, obviously, they're there, because that is the sort of universe we live in. Again, the key thought experiment here is to rewind the the tape on the universe. If nothing changes, you do not have free will. What did you do this morning? Let's rewind the tape. Based on what you know about physics, and based on the reminder that your brain is just another thing obeying the laws of physics, could we rewind the tape and see you behave even slightly differently? The answer to this problem really just rests on these two things. 1) Your ability to visualize the physics as clockwork 2) Your intellectual honesty in being able to admit that you are essentially a meat robot, if that's what the evidence suggests. It's usually 2) that people struggle with, but I'll address that at the end of this post.\n\n&gt; I think at the heart of free-will impossibilism is the conviction that dualism is required for free will, that our material bodies are somehow \"not enough\" to make decisions. I disagree with this. Nothing beyond a material existence is necessary to think decide and act.\n\nThis is a strawman, because any sophisticated argument against free will rest on human psychology and neuroscience, but include both dualistic and materialistic explanations for the idea that no configuration of a universe where deterministic physics occurs can make room for free will. The only reason to include these dualistic arguments is because religion happens to be a thing, and the purpose of these arguments is to demonstrate that not even an omnipotent, omniscient being can give you free will.\n\n...Which is, hilariously, the main way free will is invoked to this day aside from some nauseating philosophical performance art -- this idea that we were given free will by the creator of the universe. It almost seems like our ancestors knew the idea was bullshit and had to come up with *something*. If we're just souls, you **did not choose your soul**. If we are our brains, you **did not choose the things which shape your brain**, and since the things which **shape your brain**, shape the neurons which shape the \"thoughts\" you're describing as freely chosen, they are by definition. The proponent of free will says, at this point, \"Ah, but YOU feed back *into* your brain!\" This would be great, if \"you\" were somehow a pristine, sterile, entity in a vacuum with no prior casual influences. Then perhaps, you'd have free will. But the reality is, the thing which feeds back into \"you\", is just a determined \"you\", not a free you(which is to say, not free from the chains of one's 1) genes 2) parents 3) environment 4) upbringing 5) chance events 6) abyss of one's own mind from which thoughts mysteriously emerge). Hopefully this makes sense.\n\nNot freely chosen. Aka, not authored. Aka, determined. Notice how there's no \"Illusion of Determinism\", but there is an \"Illusion of Free Will\". I want to ask you, how closely have you investigated this idea in an introspective way? Have you examined how thoughts form in your mind, while understanding that your brain, according to neuroscience and psychology, is simply a void from which mysterious neurons fire?\n\nI appreciate your hypothesis for the heart of the free will\/determinism confusion, personally I think the acceptance\/rejection of either have to do more with psychological traits than something like intelligence or wisdom. Those high in egocentrism, or perhaps high in a kind of neuroticism that would result in the reality of determinism to be psychologically destabilizing, should be more inclined to believe in free will. The great thing is, someone can actually test this hypothesis in the lab. The PhD thesis aside, it's more interesting to me the sorts of reaction proponents of free will would have to a study that showed a strong correlation between individuals high in egocentrism and neuroticism and a belief in free will, and a high correlation between those low in egocentrism and a belief that we're all just robots and the self is an illusion. Humans are highly emotional and irrational, and their beliefs will be *determined*(Heh) by their psychological traits, and what they personally find attractive, not by what happens to match the evidence(Especially if it conflicts with their sense of self).\n","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1553975652,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"id":"ejr8umg","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_b74dq0","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ejqwha8","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/b74dq0\/some_important_truths_are_scientifically\/ejr8umg\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1554132183,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public"}

However, if you devise a study that primes a subject to pick something, then asks them \"Why did you pick this thing?\" and then the subject responds with some bullshit answer they're absolutely convinced by, and then the experimenters say \"Well actually, we implanted the idea and determined your choice for you...\", this poses a pretty huge problem for the idea of free will, because it's not like you're free everywhere other than psychological studies of that sort. You're being primed by forces you have no control over, at all times. No freedom, alas.\n\nExperiments aren't even needed, but they sure do put the nail in the coffin. Have you ever read about identical twin studies, separated at birth? There are endless examples in the literature that go something like, where upon re-uniting, the twins have both married a woman by the same name, have the exact same breakfast every morning, both wear mustaches but not full beards, and both purchased the brand\/year of automobile, and this just goes on and on. The role of genes alone is profound in demonstrating how much of what you do is determined, and not meaningfully chosen.\n\nTake buying a car, like these twins did. What better example of a free choice could there be? You have all the brands, makes, models, styles to choose from. But do you? The entire psychological literature would say no, this choice is determined by other things, not by you, the executive, sitting there metaphorically in your own head pressing the \"Ford Mustang[Confirm]\" button. It turns out the reason you chose this car is the exact same reason your identical twin separated at birth,had they been alive, would have chosen the exact same car. And for this very reason, you would have chosen the same car, over, and over, and over again if we could rewind the tape of the universe a trillion times. \n\nThe bottom line: If there's no alternative choice to make, if you're going to repeat the same exact choice, if we just set the atoms and quarks and neurons to precisely the same state they were in prior to your choice, then **there is no meaningful freedom of choice**. We happen to live in a universe where determinism is everywhere, so...\n\nThe rest is a mystery of one's own psychology. What causes one to reject something so painfully obvious? My personal hypothesis is some ideas are intensely psychologically destabilizing. The ego is a survival mechanism, after all. Things which threaten survival mechanisms tend to be ferociously guarded against. If there was no free will, we should expect vehement opposition to it, given what we know about human psychology. Of course, there's also lots of confusion that helps this problem, for instance the idea that no free will entails nihilism or fatalism, which isn't necessary at all.\n","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1553992372,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"id":"ejrv14m","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_b74dq0","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ejrnc0u","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/b74dq0\/some_important_truths_are_scientifically\/ejrv14m\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1554142567,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public"}

If we lived in the sort of random universe you're describing, we would expect scenarios where we have the perfect math and information, to just appear randomly sometimes. What **you're** claiming is that the universe *could* behave differently if we could reverse the motion of the particles by a millisecond, and press play again.\n\nTherefore, according to you, we don't *truly* know how deterministic the universe is(Hint: It is currently deterministic), therefore there's *room* for free will.

It's unclear to me). That being said, it still isn't compelling, because it feels like a magic trick that sneaks the rabbit into the hat of a deterministic world.

It's a problem of mis-identification, not an unfree will (will being the summation of sub-mind decisions, roughly, the will of the system in toto).\n\nI really think this illustrates what muddies a lot of free will\/determinism discussion. Notice how you need to put \"I\" in quotations. I appreciate this honesty, because it shows you're willing to admit unconscious processes influence(and I'll say determine) decision, but I think this isn't enough. You also need to put the word 'choice' in quotations. Because while I understand perfectly what you're trying to say, that the thing you're calling \"I\" is a collection of sub processes that is distinguished from say \"Not you\", ie, another person, or a rock. But what you're calling a choice isn't a meaningful choice, where you really were free to choose something else. You can't call it a deliberate, meaningful choice, because it was influenced by sub-processes outside of your control. If we live in a universe where your taste receptors and brain recoil to vanilla, but cause a neurochemical reaction that results in salivation and craving to chocolate, you aren't free to choose vanilla, no matter how you slice it, no matter how you partition the self, no matter how you define \"choice\" as something like, \"simply an action that is possible by a collection of things that occurs in something we'll call 'I' \".\n\nHave you performed the introspection thought experiment with openness in regards to the deterministic nature of mind?\n\nClose your eyes and pick a fruit. Pay close attention to the way your mind works when you do this. You're free to choose any fruit you want. No one is holding a gun to your head, and take all the time you want. You can respond to this specific part of my statement in 10 minutes or 10 years, so you have really all the time you need to perform this experiment. You could research all the fruits of the world starting from the moment you finish this paragraph even so you can be really sure you're getting a totally fair representation of fruits to pick your meaningful choice from. \n\nWhen you finally decide, scrap that fruit. Forget it. Instead, note the way that choice came to be. Maybe you have a specific story about that fruit. Maybe you looked over some exotic fruits because you didn't want to seem boring, but the ever present reminder of how amazing your grandma's apple pie was couldn't be shaken, so you went with apple. Now, pick a new fruit. You're free to pick anything that wasn't your first choice. \n\n**What fruit do you pick**?\n\n\nAgain , this is where the thought experiment ends and we have to sit here, with our best attempt at being honest and rational, and ask ourselves if we can, given what we know about the brain, about neurons, and about psychology, and say you meaningfully chose the fruit you finally chose?\n\nThink back to the example with ones grandmother and apples. Maybe some people believe you could tell yourself \"Okay no actually, since I'm *aware* of how unshakeable the nagging thought of gran's apple pie is(Love her by the way, nothing against you granny) I'm going to intentionally **not** pick apple because it's *so* obvious. \n\nAgain, if someone does this, this isn't freedom. It's simply a result of various psychological penchants. The less obvious details here are also that you couldn't have picked the fruits you have no knowledge of. Perhaps you've never heard of a wood apple(if you have, there are fruits you probably have no knowledge of), so you're not free to pick those. What about fruits you do know of, but didn't come to mind? They just weren't in the cards. Your brain dealt you \"Grandma's apple pie\" over and over and over again. What if there's a helpful assistant there to say \"Don't forget about that sinky fruit, you know, Durian?\" and you go \"Ohh yeaaaaah.\" Whelp, congratulations, you've now been primed. Will you pick durian now? Maybe you'll tell yourself \"Well now I *can't* pick Durian otherwise it won't seem like an original choice, or it'll seem like I've been influenced, or I'll pick it just to stand my ground and say \"**I** really picked Durian, case closed!\" All of these answers drip with psychology outside of ones control. Notice how insane and detached from the real, endless, influences which all emerge from the darkness this sort of inner monologue is? This is what a train of self-absorbed thought looks like, in real time. Self-absorbed is the key word, here, this is the psychological **property** that facilitates the illusion. The sensation that one is really the arbiter here is totally illusory when you simply admit of all the variables that influence the decision. If all of these things influence the decision, it **cannot** be freely chosen. Again, we're talking about a **free** choice.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1554063442,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{"gid_1":0,"gid_2":0,"gid_3":0},"id":"ejttnh9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_b74dq0","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ejtqddp","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/b74dq0\/some_important_truths_are_scientifically\/ejttnh9\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1554237249,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/philosophy","subreddit_type":"public"}
