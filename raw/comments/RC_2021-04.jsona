Every trait-set(disorder profile) is ultimately on a spectrum, and we match these pattern-sets to a greater\/lesser degree. For example, depending on how strongly you represent a hypersensitivity to pattern recognition, we may call you a Schizophrenic. But this is a narrow labeling, and there's nothing stopping you from also being deeply autistic if you have extreme detail sensitivity, have autistic ticks, lack social ability, + whatever the other autistic traits are. Our current field of Psychiatry fairly poorly accounts for this style of diagnosis. People are simply checked off on a box in many cases and the case is closed(I'm aware exceptions exist, but in the broadest scope, Psychiatry has a long way to go).\n\nIf you're ever played a classical RPG, or any game where characters have \"Stats\" like \"Strength\", \"Dexterity\", \"Intelligence, \"Charisma\", I see humans in the same sense except quantifying these various broad categories we call \"disorders\". So, Autism is at 2, but Bipolar is at 4, Schizophrenia at 4, and OCD at 9. Etc etc. All human beings alive are quantifiable in *principle*(not necessarily in practice) this way. This does not pose a problem for this being an objective nature of human psychology, because just because we may not ever be able to tell someone \"You have an autism level of 127\", does not mean that such specific quantification does not exist, in the same way that just because we may never be able to represent the exact *movement pattern* of all atoms on Earth, does not mean such a pattern does not exist, or that an **exact**, objective number, of atoms exists, for instance. Facts are not merely physical, they are conceptual too.

To me, Stoicism is ultimately obscurantist in a world where evil rules reality. For the \"hypothetical evil ruler\" to have a functional dystopia, they would very much prefer a peasantry of stoics over depressed peasants. This is not because stoicism helps the peasants, it **obviously** does-- I feel like many people here are so pathologically cynical and pessimist(As a hardcore cynic and pessimist myself) that they struggle even to understand that Stoicism *helps* the peasant-- it's why so many people promote Stoicism, it actually reduces suffering if you can re-orient your views towards it this way. But that's not the point. That's not why Stoicism is bad. Stoicism is bad because it helps the evil ruler more.\n\nIf you're in a torture scenario, you'll do anything just to survive. Sisyphus *needs* Stoicism because he can't commit suicide, but humans don't need Stoicism. Stoics just assume by fiat that life is worth living. In doing this, and in \"learning to smile\", they live a life that carries the coat-tails of the extended phenotype of maximized predatory evil, holding up this \"camouflaged cloak\", and covering reality with it.\n\nStoics need to learn to frown, and to say \"This reality is an evil hellword-- this should be acknowledged and it should be stopped\".

Notice the difference between this though, and saying \"The psychopath in prison may be evil, but they shouldn't be tortured for the entertainment of the prison guards just for being born so unlucky, that their genes, life, upbringing, etc, brought them to harm people and land in prison.\" You don't need even a drop of empathy to make that statement, you just need to understand that sadism is wrong.\n\nEmpathy is crucial to humanity because without it we can't, through sheer accident, understand each other's pains and pleasures, but in scientific terms it is only a \"rough guide\" for emotional connection, it doesn't always bring us to the right place, so don't beat yourself up just because you sometimes don't feel empathy when you think you should. A shocking number of people seem to think that empathy is **always** good and its presence means you **must** be a good person, and its absence says you **must** be evil-- this is not true.

Evil is a set of traits that produce certain behaviors and consequences. Evil is **not** merely behavior. Every behavior you can think of, can be done in a good context, or an evil context(even the worst thing you can imagine, can be done in a greater, added context of \"Benevolent consequences\", in principle). Evil is deeper than mere behavior. Evil is a set of traits as well. The traits that lead to evil are:\n\n* Domination(you can never negotiate with evil-- you can never negotiate with the Nazi Guards kicking you into the gas chamber, you can never negotiate with the school bully, you can never negotiate during the moments of rape(or murder) with a being like Ted Bundy)\n\n* Callousness(this is a lack of concern for the wellbeing of conscious things as a general axiom. It's often fundamental in anything you could possibly conceive of that could be called \"evil\")\n\n* Self-absorption, Ego-mania, Narcissism, Self-aggrandizing ( Evil feels *more important*, *better than* you. Evil is *hot shit*. For evil to say \"You and I are merely equals\" is completely out of character, and would harm it's ability to be evil).\n\n* Manipulation (Evil is motivated to \"fuck with things\". Evil is a core reason democracy cannot function. Evil is the reason a young girl's reputation is destroyed in school due to gossip by malicious actors)\n\n* Deception ( Lying is a bedrock of evil-- without lying, evil could not function, because it would need to be confronted with itself at minimum, which would harm how successfully it functions in the world. Evil lies to itself about how scary and threatening a situation *really* is, causing fearlessness, and low-risk aversion. The biggest victim of the lies of evil are evil itself-- the phenomenon of \"Self deception\". Evil is why the problem of evil can never be solved itself-- why it is a paradox-- because for every step forward you get in untangling the deceptions within the memeplex where evil lives, 100 more deceptions are born before you could finish the thought.)\n\n* Charm (Evil is **beautiful**, or at minimum, evil is *appealing*. Evil is charismatic. We're misled via the aforementioned deception, that evil is some horrible demonic thing with sharp teeth and red eyes or a goatee-- this is intentional. There was a period in Christian art where Satan was depicted as beautiful, but this period did not last)\n\nOkay great, so what? What does this have to do with reality? How does one even get these traits? These traits evolve via evolution through natural selection. All of our traits are the products of genes modulated by environment. But... what about good traits? Can't people have those? Well, yes and no. Yes, you can see something as \"good behavior\", but ultimately, it's an evil trait motivating that behavior. This is because evil traits simply *beat* good traits, in a game environment, so we're all evolved to exploit our environment today since that's what arbitrarily happens to \"win\". Think of this like a law of physics in our world. Imagine two star athletes, in your favorite sport. Imagine these two athletes play endless sets of games in a simulation, with one star athlete following the rules of the game, and the other star athlete skillfully cheating. Like in our world, this simulation has no referee, so any move goes as long as you \"score points\". It's a brutal game of \"winner takes all\"(Again, our world). Who will win? The most skilled noble virtuous player? Or the most skilled cheater? Obviously, the cheater wins-- they have access to all the skills and moves the enemy has, **plus** the ability to cheat with any illegal move they'd like. The good athlete **cannot** cheat, it would cause him to not be good. The good athlete isn't even optimized for cheating, they lack the right traits to dominate, to deceive, to manipulate, to feel this bloodlust and reward in their brain for really *destroying* their opponent-- Evil has all of this in spades. This is why you can **never win** in the long term, being ethical. You can only 'lose less', within an ethical context, but not in an ultimate context.\n\nLastly, can't good win through sheer ... force of will? Luck? Determination? Friendship? Skill? Hard work?\n\nNo. The reason is entropy, the second law of thermodynamics, constantly gives evil the edge. Even if you could out-skill or out-smart evil, you can never catch up to it, because in our unique universe, due to the way matter moves from order-&gt;disorder by **nature**, it's always easier to break something, than to fix it. This means it's almost always easier to be malicious, than to be benevolent. It's easier to set something on fire, than to undo the damage. It's easier to spread a false rumor, than to undo the ill effects. Etc. Evil has the advantage. Over time(like our 3.5 billion evolutionary years on Earth), evil will have a very strong foothold, and this will only continue to grow as technological advancement occurs. Then whatever this Earth produces will go on to compete for domination of the solar system, galaxy, universe, and so on.\n\nThis is the bad news. The good news is, it's unlikely that this local area is the worst universe possible. Not every single being is burned\/eaten alive\/tortured\/raped(most are at least one of these, but not everyone is). Everyone is guaranteed to suffer, but we have access to methods that reduce suffering, like the training of the mind through meditation, which is what I recommend. You're in hell, so simply strive to move in a way that minimizes the evil \/ it's effect on the world(be careful-- the road to a bigger hell is paved by ~~good~~ all forms of intentions), and strive to be as un-evil as possible. Avoid cookie cutter ideology, avoid \"isms\", avoid egocentric behavior insofar as it is possible for a human to do, and be charitable and honest. Recognize that free will is incoherent, and therefore \"blaming\" evil for *being* evil, is also incoherent-- Evil also loses this game state with us(in the grandest sense possible-- it wins in a superficial sense), it just can't comprehend that, due to a function what it **is**.\n\n&gt;A bit beyond perception's reach\n\n&gt;I sometimes believe I see\n\n&gt;that life is two locked boxes\n\n&gt;each containing the other's key.\n\n\u2014 Piet Hein","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1617416911,"distinguished":null,"edited":1617479050.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gt7gkdu","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_m60ygv","locked":false,"name":"t1_gt7gkdu","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_m60ygv","permalink":"\/r\/Athkneovism\/comments\/m60ygv\/there_is_no_redemption_is_there\/gt7gkdu\/","retrieved_utc":1628423461,"score":7,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Athkneovism","subreddit_id":"t5_3s94ev","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[]}

If veganism is about giving money to the forces that contribute to the animal holocaust, then it's still possible to oppose species-ism and *not* be vegan(and simultaneously eat *nothing* but Beyond Whoppers). If veganism is about the attitude that says \"All animal suffering is unethical\" then one can still be anti-speciesism without begin vegan, because under this semantic understanding, even say, testing a drug to alleviate 100 million suffering humans on 100 animals, would be ethically wrong. But if we define veganism in the loosest terms possible, something like \"frivolous exploitation of a species by another is wrong\", then it essentially becomes close enough to be synonymous with anti-speciesism, in which case, they necessarily imply each other.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1617477949,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gt9w1up","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mjecqb","locked":false,"name":"t1_gt9w1up","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_mjecqb","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/mjecqb\/does_being_antispeciesism_necessarily_imply_one\/gt9w1up\/","retrieved_utc":1628417412,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

You seem to have correctly recognized that it's backwards-- it takes immense courage to do, and is a terrifying scenario. If anything, it's cowardly to keep going through the motions without reflecting for a second on the possibility that one lives a lie, or one exists in a hellworld. Someone in the position of suicide at minimum has the courage to reflect on their life and ask: \"Is this worth ending?\" This is a symptom of sanity, to me, in a world where the insane run the asylum.\n\nOn that note, I highlighted the specific text on purpose, because it's always possible that the suicidal individual is also living a lie-- our subjective experience is simply not a reliable representation of reality-- we generally know that everyone is more or less delusional on our planet, according to the conclusions of psychology-- cognitive bias, the fallibility of memory, the inaccuracy of the senses, and a host of other \"brain bugs\".\n\nThat being said,  I believe in the Right to Die for everyone ultimately, I just think it seems more of a coinflip whether or not it's correct, except in the easiest cases, like immense suffering.

This is why meta-ethics is so frustrating, there's an absurd scenario for every narrow idea of what ethics is. These positions try to distill \"The thing\", the \"source\" of ethics, and then in some highly narrow(often deeply systematizing, so biased towards logic and axioms that one misses the forest for the trees) way, attempts to perform \"ethical calculations\" that can lead to absurd outcomes. \n\nLook at the Parfit example and the counterargument-- it just becomes this psychopathic meta game where one person says, \"look -- this system can't work\", and then another person says, \"No no, see, that's just a bad interpretation of my system-- if the thirsty person never found themselves in the desert in the *first* place, they'd be properly adhering to Consequentialism.

Who benefits from a consequentialist world where a Holocaust can occur if you can convince people it's \"For the greater good\"?\n\nThe ontology of ethics *can't* be this way in my mind.

Lie to a child enough, and they will become \"lie detectors\", because eventually they will realize they are being lied to, and from there, you force a game that says \"Is this a lie?\" One only gets better and better at this game with time, and that's why this behavior of lying to children still exists-- it's part of an evolutionary trick that forces adaptation to deception(but abuses children in the process-- this is a common trend with evolution).\n\nAfter a point, I read a book on Lying that changed my life, because it framed the ethics of lying in a way I never considered, and it took me a few years, but eventually I really understood why the point of that book is so important. If we are to get anywhere in life, it has to be with a commitment to honesty, to ourselves, to others. To lie to someone means to tell them \"You don't deserve to know reality\" or \"I'm too selfish to tell you what reality is\". It gets complicated, like for example, we don't need to constantly shout the truth from the rooftops to not lie, but it really involves a certain intention of not being malicious or manipulative.

Successful domination is covert because it's obviously easier to dominate something if they have no idea they're being dominated.\n\nThis is why the phenotype of \"the psychopath\" includes a lot of traits that obfuscate what's going on-- deception, not just lies they tell, but the ability to lie to *themselves* so they tell the most straight faced lie possible. This is the way evolution puts the rabbit into the hat. Then there's manipulation, and the charming exterior. \n\nSomething controls powerful algorithms and powerful robots right now, and this is only improving. Is that a controversial idea?

Pretending like this has *nothing to do* with domination because we're not living out the plot of Terminator 2 to perfection is just... strange.\n\nEdit: By the way, another psychopathic trait is sadomasochism. This is a brilliant combo, because a sadist alone is only incentivized to harm others, but still suffers from harm. A masochist is resistant\/incentivized to receive harm, but has no motivation to dominate anything, it can't get off the ground in the evolutionary race.

Here's an example:\n\nYou have flour, water, sugar, apples, oil. You can combine these things in endless ways, but you'll always have something resembling an apple product, or a sugary product, or a floury product, etc, in most of them. Can you have one scenario where it's literally a pinch of flour sugar apples and oil suspended in a gallon of water? Yeah, that's possible in *principle* I guess(unrealistic in practice because ... why would you ever do that), but yeah it's *possible*. But what you don't get is something like a garlic fried rice dish with those ingredients. That's how genes work, except with a dramatic assortment of ingredients so the way this analogy changes with genes is  you *could* get something like a garlic fried rice dish from nothing but flour and apples etc, except... it's... never *quite* a garlic fried rice dish. It could *look* like it, or smell like, but it won't quite be identical. I'm sure that's going to be unintuitive\/convoluted for some people but hopefully it makes sense to explain how nature\/nurture works.\n\nGrounded genetic example: \n\nIf you have the genes to become a 6'4 basketball player, you can maybe become one, in the right circumstances. But if you have the genes to become a 5'1 racing jockey because your parents and their parents and their parents expressed those genes, chances are you *won't* ever become a 6'4 basketball player. People who *really* love nurture(and are deeply offended by the deterministic nature of genes) often split hairs here and say something like: \"But anything is possible! They can take growth hormones! In a future where medical technology improves, maybe we can make them 6'4!\" Yes, but that's in *spite* of the genes. The genes are really very much the stuff \"you have to work with\" and sometimes you *just* have shitty ingredients, much like if, again, to draw a cooking analogy, the context was to bake a cake, but you got *literal* feces to work with, barring the possibility that the judges are coprophiliacs, you would not be able to create a cake with your ingredients. Some genes are like this, where no matter how much \"baking\" or \"nurture\"(barring of course, literally changing all the genes to make the entire argument pointless), you just can't get something to fit your goals from your starting materials. Again I feel the opportunity here presents itself for someone to miss the point, a thought that goes along the lines of: \"But we can master all of physics, all of genetic engineering!\" Notice how this argument would even work for the cake baking contest participant-- just transform the literal shit into a decadent chocolate cake. \"Checkmate, it's all nurture!\".","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1617659248,"distinguished":null,"edited":1617659972.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gti1tot","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mkt2r5","locked":false,"name":"t1_gti1tot","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_mkt2r5","permalink":"\/r\/Schizoid\/comments\/mkt2r5\/nature_versus_nurture_debate\/gti1tot\/","retrieved_utc":1628397414,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizoid","subreddit_id":"t5_2qxro","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

It is possible to die in agony and fail to understand a) the gravity of one's own dying in agony, for complex evolutionary reasons(ie, we are generally self-absorbed, psychotic, narcissistic, create clever narratives to not confront the fact that we are dying in agony), b) the gravity of others(again, see self-absorbed, narcissistic).

What would it take to happen to you in life for you to say \"Suffering is the ethical bullseye\"? Out of curiosity. I genuinely don't even know if our intuitions here can ever scale with the objective ethics, because it's possible that human beings just get too deranged beyond certain experiences, again, for evolutionary reasons. For this reason, a sophisticated ethics does not weigh very heavily the intuitions of sadists or masochists, for obvious reasons.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1617724458,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gtkyirm","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mj9vxq","locked":false,"name":"t1_gtkyirm","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_gtjt6fp","permalink":"\/r\/Efilism\/comments\/mj9vxq\/i_just_love_this_video\/gtkyirm\/","retrieved_utc":1628390039,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Efilism","subreddit_id":"t5_2w5p7","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[]}

The only thing that made the world seem grim was things that directly affected them. Nowadays, the world may seem grimmer than during those times, even though we actually have it better, generally speaking of course.\n\nAh okay, fully understandable. I think part of the culprit here may be the fact that you've lived in such an idyllic part of  the world. Even I'm \"spoiled\", by global standards, living below the poverty line in New York City, but it's still sufficient to expose a completely psychopathic landscape. Reliably breaking such an illusion would be very difficult in a quaint country with relatively low issues and some of the highest quality of life on the planet. Now compare to other [parts of the world(NSFL)](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/y0W0e3A.jpg):\n\nIt turns out that where one is \"thrown\" exactly, can dramatically shift one's representation of reality. This is a very big problem when attempting to converge on the nature of reality, no? Is this purely a matter of subjectivity, or can one, through sheer subjectivity, be \"more right\"(by sheer accident of being thrown into a more ontologically salient representation of the world)?","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1617725146,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gtl03cc","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mjd0cm","locked":false,"name":"t1_gtl03cc","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_gtk0zdg","permalink":"\/r\/philosophy\/comments\/mjd0cm\/racism_as_selflove\/gtl03cc\/","retrieved_utc":1628389925,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"philosophy","subreddit_id":"t5_2qh5b","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Psychopathy is normalized, a lack of empathy is normalized, cruelty is normalized, superficial charm is normalized, deception is normalized, narcissism is normalized.\n\n**What** does all of this mean? First notice these are all the traits of psychopathy. Just re-read the sentence real fast, look at the traits. They're all the traits of psychopathy. Now what does it mean to say these traits are \"normalized\" in specific terms? A lack of empathy is simply the *default*. If you live in a big city, this will be *crystal* clear. People will be very overtly suffering, and people will just go on along their way. You may think, \"Oh, this is sort of understandable-- the average person thinks helping the homeless\/suffering\/etc is *normal*\". First of all, it's not, but even if it were, you still see this lack of empathy in so called \"friendships\" or \"acquaintance\" situations. The caveat here is if you're young, you may not have learned this unpleasant truth yet. But the harsh truth that most people would reject kicking and screaming is, your \"friends\" would run a sharp piece of rock across your throat just to get some food if the circumstances were sufficiently dire, say, trapped on an island and profoundly starved-- humans are *animals* first and foremost.\n\nCruelty is socially acceptable in most contexts. Bullying has been the norm in schools since the *dawn* of schools, and this has not changed in 2021. The bullies just need to get more clever. If you know what I mean, you simply *know*. If you don't, then you're simultaneously lucky and unlucky.\n\nWhat does \"Superficial charm\" mean? It's that \"Fake\" tone you encounter in just about all social situations. It's *everywhere*.\n\nDeception? Lying is simply the *norm* in our society. You're expected to lie when someone asks you \"How are you?\" Everything is *merely* colloquial. You never answer this question earnestly-- \"Terrible, my severely deranged partner or parent is attemping to ruin my life\". You simply say \"Fine\" or \"So-so\". The more malicious a person is, the more pathologically they lie-- and there's no shortage of these people.\n\n\nGiven *these* circumstances...\n\n\nWhat does it mean to have a robust \"social battery\"? I'm not trying to trivialize BPD, clearly this is something people need help with. Clearly this does not appear to come about from a picturesque childhood. But not every single symptom of feature of a so called \"Disorder\" is a pathology like you're constantly reminded in our world.\n\n&gt; It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society.\n\n- Jiddu Krishnamurti","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1618089229,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gu2zbj2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mo146a","locked":false,"name":"t1_gu2zbj2","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_mo146a","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/mo146a\/dae_run_out_of_your_social_battery\/gu2zbj2\/","retrieved_utc":1628343562,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Life is profoundly meaningful, but we are conditioned towards nihilistic attitude, both in social terms(the ideas we're presented with in life), and in evolutionary terms(the tendencies our brains tend to gravitate towards at this given point in evolution).\n\nYour life may feel empty, but it's not empty-- it's full of evidence about the nature of reality-- evidence which you are struggling to interpret(through no fault of your own-- I'm not blaming you or criticizing you in any way, simply describing what your situation appears to be).\n\n&gt;  I have no ambitions and I can only feel emotions that make me sad, angry or miserable.\n\nYes but this does not mean that you've properly identified the conditions of the world to which these emotions are appropriate. I am **not** saying that due to this, your emotional states are not genuinely bad. They are genuinely bad subjectively-- even someone suffering a psychotic break on a high dose of certain reality-distorting drugs, is deeply unlucky to be in a psychologically tortured state, it's just that this state only tracks reality in very narrow subjective terms. It doesn't say anything about the world, it just says something about the internal experience( which still matters, but we're really concerned about the \"external\" to inform us here). What does it mean first of all to *not* be concerned at all with external reality? It suggests features like egocentrism, self-absorption, narcissism, etc. These are distinct and not at all synonymous, but there's a certain \"blindness\" of these deeply \"inward\" ways of being, clearly.\n\n&gt; It doesn't get better and there is no help.\n\nThis is correct, yes, but not for the right reasons as I said. Still, the human brain is incredible at getting to the right answer for the wrong reasons. Our brains are in fact optimized to put representations of the world together this way. This is the best evolution could have done without directly optimizing our brains to process reality, which would be too maladaptive. To see reality for what it is( a hellscape where the most brutal predator and dominator wins the game), would have been too traumatic to grasp. It would have filled our ancestors with sheer futility with depression, which compound maladaptive traits, and those in touch with reality would have either been killed by predators who had no desire to interpret reality, or they would have simply been out-competed for resources.\n\n&gt; I actually hate myself for falling into such misery especially after years of fighting for something better, but I don't know what is better anymore.\n\nI don't think it's rational to \"hate yourself\". Clearly some people feel this, but it simply has no basis in truths about reality. To hate yourself, you would have to hold yourself to a standard that says \"I could have acted otherwise\". This is completely in contradiction with the way the world works-- where people are simply thrown into their conditions, don't decide anything when it comes to their own causality. Everyone is essentially blameless in our world, even the worst human being(or being) in existence. No one can be anything other than what they are. If your response to this is, \"But people can change!\" Yes, clearly, but they can't change *freely*, they are not responsible for being the horrible person who does change, nor are they responsible for being the horrible person who *doesn't* change-- all of this is determined by causes outside of their control.\n\nHopefully this provokes some thought in a helpful way.

If you can conceivably come up with worlds containing suffering which are far more ethical than worlds with zero suffering, then suffering too is also simply not the bullseye.

But as an approach to *ethics*, it suffers from the same problems as Utilitarianism, NU, etc. Instead of suffering\/pleasure math, it's now optimizing reality to not desire, again via some sort of empirical \"algebra\", yes? \n\n&gt; Rather, our pursuit of pleasure and our aversion to pain both manifest themselves as a conscious need (craving) to change something about the current experience. These cravings are what qualify as suffering. \n\nThis is a fine subjective description of suffering, and so far this system offers the most practical and pragmatic solution to ethics I've seen thus far. It's possible that NU may result in more ethical worlds according to my ethics, but this philosophy(edit: I'm speaking about NU) only functions in principle, not in practice, because the nature of the world is such that pro-suffering agents thrive in a world full of suffering, which ends up compounding the problem of suffering, and never \"solves\" it, since these pro-suffering agents are by definition motivated to cause suffering from positions of power. That being said, it does not describe ethics in objective terms, it only provides an antidote to the negative valences of an unethical world. One can still suffer child rape in a perfectly Tranquilist society, but the child would subjectively simply be optimized to not be averse to it. This is not exactly moral progress, in my view. It's a \"pragmatic hack\", yes, and if we could give all future victims of child rape(and therefore, victims of intense trauma), a \"Tranquilist\" pill, it would be both in the interests of NU and Tranquilists and possibly other ethical systems to do such a thing(Not strict Utilitarians though.. hmm), but under morally realist ethical systems this does not *solve* the problem in idealistic terms, only in pragmatic terms. Hopefully that clarifies my former objection-- I'm actually not opposed to the ideas in the text, again, this may be the best approach we have out of a set of nothing but \"unideal, imperfectly optimized, losing approaches\", if that makes sense.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1618095099,"distinguished":null,"edited":1618096788.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gu3a3g1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_moakix","locked":false,"name":"t1_gu3a3g1","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_gu36v1s","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/moakix\/tranquilism_the_absence_of_cravings_as_the\/gu3a3g1\/","retrieved_utc":1628342781,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

If nothing is objective, then there's just no conversation to get off of the ground, it's this confusion that ethics is somehow distinct from math that I argue against-- they are ontologically identical to me. They both use numbers and letters to describe the dynamics between things(numbers for starters with math, conscious things with ethics) in a way that actually describes the nature of these things in relationship to themselves in the context of their frameworks(logic, for starters with math, or right\/wrong, with ethics). \n\nThe meme of \"There is no *real* right and wrong\" has been \"semantically gamed\" into our current memosphere, if you apply the same ontology to ethics as you do math, you will discover they are identical too, it's just that ethics requires a far more complex semantic game and is far more inconvenient for certain people on our planet, so we can't really get this game off of the ground academically. Math on the otherhand, is perfectly compatible with anyone from the king to the peasant, so math is robustly accepted into our collective ontology. It's more complex than this of course, phenomenology is *directly* involved in an understanding of ethics. It should be perfectly intuitive to us now that if objective ethics exist, people we'd call \"psychopaths\" would be poorly optimized to have a genuine understanding. They would only need to have evolved a superficial projection of whatever ethical norms happen to be in operation at the time-- being optimized to deeply understand what makes something right\/wrong is completely unnecessary from an evolutionary perspective. Unfortunately, a lot of our species is psychopathic\/psychopathic adjacent, this is simply what happens when we descend from countless millions of years of evolutionary murder and rape.\n\nThat being said, if one wishes to take a purely idealistic stance and say we're doomed to subjectivity, we cannot make any real progress anywhere. If we take into account this subjectivity however, there is no reason to think right and wrong is any different from 2+2, but a game that is often played here is math is seen as somehow \"more empirical\", while ethics is branded forever with being doomed to subjectivity, brittleness, etc. This is a double standard, because it's sheer happenstance that we can verify mathematical truths( they are simple to verify and not inconvenient for people in our local power structure), and we struggle to verify ethical truths. They are deeply inconvenient to say, militaries, intelligence agencies, kings, tyrants, CEO's, etc-- there's much profit and investment involved in a **lack** of ethical coherence\/understanding, therefore we will perpetually struggle to get a clear ethical ontology off the ground, unlike mathematics, which is required to do things that are deeply involved in the aforementioned parties interests.

From here, form the most pragmatic approach possible. Since a simulation is a \"top down\" endeavor, it can never really happen in an ethically salient way. Simulations can happen, obviously, but not in a way where there isn't some hidden, greater cost. Our world always functions this way, where all \"progress\" is a simultaneous ethical regress when we maximize scope. Technology like smartphones that empower the worlds average citizens? Also provides a global infrastructure\/network of surveillance and general exploitation\/manipulation-- for example. All social progress, all steps towards civility, serve to mask the ethical dilemma we're faced with: Psychopathy.

I'm not sure if it's possible in practice to reduce suffering, it depends on how \"explosive\" our biology+consciousness generation is. In a world vision like that of Jeff Bezos, this at minimum entails a world of trillions of humans. That is only humans, we don't know how many forced lives of other species this entails. If this sort of world is guaranteed(consciousness density appears to only increase with time as resources are consumed exponentially), then suffering reduction on the whole is probably impossible. \n\nThis is why I think words like \"in principle\" or \"in practice\" are so important-- we should not be too concerned about what we can do on Earth in *principle*, because this will be determined purely by what governs what is possible in practice(dominance, power, etc).\n\nWhen I express pessimism about ethical progress, I don't refer to suffering, only about true ethical progress(a better universe to exist in, objectively-- not in subjective terms, although there's obviously a relationship to subjectivity).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1618157353,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gu5o7ol","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_moakix","locked":false,"name":"t1_gu5o7ol","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_gu578oh","permalink":"\/r\/negativeutilitarians\/comments\/moakix\/tranquilism_the_absence_of_cravings_as_the\/gu5o7ol\/","retrieved_utc":1628336717,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"negativeutilitarians","subreddit_id":"t5_j5x1o","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Specifically with Better Angels or some of the optimistic ideas in Enlightenment, I dismiss them because violence going down does not mean a) suffering goes down or b) evil goes down. It's fully possible to portray a world full of gradual progress(peppered with some small-to-large oopsies), while gradually descending into evil+dystopia. This is a function of the way psychopathic traits, once in control, impinge on society. You get a world where the appearance of progress can be found, but also a world where, due to selection pressure from an overtly sociopathic model to a covertly psychopathic model, become harder and harder to identify. Language becomes lost in semantic games, it gets progressively harder to make sense of ethics, everyone becomes more alienated and divided, malicious use of technology becomes more covert, bullets are replaced with less overt means of warfare(advantageous when global hegemony is crystallizing and one no longer needs to strike fear into the hearts of ones enemies, but rather, ensure their enemies aren't aware they are being attacked), etc. This is why I think Better Angels is misleading at worst, or a kind of intellectual satire at best(Giving Pinker the absolute benefit of the doubt here as performing the \"least losing\" move in a hellscape where one cannot ever \"Win the game\" in ethical terms).","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1618158406,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gu5qgwo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_moms4g","locked":false,"name":"t1_gu5qgwo","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_moms4g","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/moms4g\/whats_wrong_with_steven_pinker\/gu5qgwo\/","retrieved_utc":1628336567,"score":15,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Again, imagine the cows in the link I posted discussing \"progress\" as agents who somehow believe they can escape or improve their conditions. We, as outsiders can clearly see they are simply in cow-hell, sheer and total domination(The documentary name is apt here, 'Dominion'-- this doesn't only apply to cows, which is why they're such a good metaphor for the human condition), and are doomed to the whims(They're not very nice whims, and to truly have that detonate in ones brain will inform one about *why* they're in the farmer position, and not vice versa) of the farmers or some other external force explicitly **above** them in the power hierarchy.\n\nTo keep the theatre going, we must pretend as if progress for us actually occurs, when in reality, everything is merely arranged for the benefit of the farmers, with superficial bones thrown(or sometimes not so superficial at first glance!

First there's the subjective context, where all subjective suffering is by definition at minimum subjective, but not all subjective suffering is objective in the same way-- in that it does not translate to reality at the same level of meaning.\n\nIf someone has a psychotic breakdown with intense anxiety and psychological pain, due to say, a bad experience with drugs, or simply a mental illness, or some kind of neurotic egomania that causes them to fail to appreciate what matters(imagine wailing in anguish about the grocery store being out of your favorite flavor of cheese doodles as if you had lost your beloved spouse to a sadistic murderer), these forms of suffering are clearly real and salient at the *subjective* level, but they don't cohere with reality in the most meaningful way. If these people could be better oriented towards reality, they'd immediately express some form of relief(probably embarrassment actually, but I don't think being embarrassed about a bad trip, or mental health, or neurosis-- all outside of our control ultimately, is rational). It would be a stroke of fortune to discover this new *objective* reality that coheres with subjectivity. \"Oh good, demons *aren't* really tormenting me from another dimension.\" \"Oh good, there *aren't* good reasons for the cheese doodles to matter *that* much\", etc.\n\nThen we get to suffering that really *does* sync with reality. There's no silver lining to being [raped in a dungeon for 24 years by your father](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fritzl_case), or extra context, or new viewpoints-- this suffering, in so far as it is experienced, is salient more than just subjectively, it's salient *objectively* in a way a delusion isn't. Clearly it's possible to suffer intensely and hallucinate the conditions of your suffering, and this is terrible, so the point here isn't \"Elizabeth Fritzl's real suffering is more real and therefore more ethically important than \"Steve\" who is simply severely psychotic and hallucinates a similar scenario all from the comfort of his bedroom, where he is fully equipped to with all basic human needs + luxuries.\"-- This is *not* the argument.

What I\u2019m understanding is that God doesn\u2019t decipher what is good and what is evil, but rather he is perfect in the laws of good that exist outside of himself. The idea that \u201cgod commands things because they are good\u201d and not \u201cthings are good because god commands them\u201d now the thing I found interesting was the idea that god is incapable of being evil meaning that he is confined to this pre existing moral code that now creates the idea that it is more powerful than him making a contradiction that he is in fact not all powerful as there is something that has power over him\n\nThe first thing to notice is how the combinations of these fantasy traits, omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, etc-- make the head spin. The likely culprit of this is not because they're all coherent traits of a single being which can either exist in principle or in practice, but because the idea is a fantasy concept invented by people who really didn't have a high bar to satisfy when it came to inventing ideas(ideas whose ultimate purpose was to socially engineer and control large numbers of people-- a much more powerful invention than any sword or gun, and practically a superweapon when there were no guns or swords)-- so they never had to make it logically coherent in the first place. The end result is always some kind of incompetent god, or some evil god, or some psychotic god, etc.\n\nEven if one could make sense of how insane(and patently human-invented) this hypothetical perfect being is, you'd still need to actually demonstrate such a thing exists. The unfortunate part is, all we have when it comes to Christian apologetics(For example, William Lane Craig's 'divine command theory', which essentially says if God commanded the rape of an infinity of children, it would be good, because everything God does is by definition good) are more frankly shitty arguments that only satisfy people who aren't interested in\/have a stake in not criticizing them(notice the similarity with the prior \"low bar to satisfy\" when it came to inventing a \"perfect God\").","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1618395527,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"guh022j","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mnzosa","locked":false,"name":"t1_guh022j","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_gugmo5y","permalink":"\/r\/Utilitarianism\/comments\/mnzosa\/the_idea_of_a_good_god_that_is_like_the_god\/guh022j\/","retrieved_utc":1628309090,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Utilitarianism","subreddit_id":"t5_2revn","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

The cows in [cow hell](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3263) should make the best move too, if they could.\n\nLet's just appreciate how doomed cows are from our higher perspective: \n\n* They can't truly fathom that they're in hell. \n* They can't kill themselves collectively, and probably can't even as individuals(I have not looked into this, I know confined marine mammals commit suicide but that's it).\n* They have no global-level communication like the internet\n* They have no language sophisticated enough to express ideas like \"Fellow bovines-- we are in **hell** right now. It would be prudent to immediately **commit suicide**.\"\n* They have neither the tools or the drugs to aid in suicide.\n* Even if they could in principle kill themselves collectively, they would be completely unable to converge if they are anything like humans. It would be just as impossible to converge as cows to commit suicide in cow hell, as it would be for humans in human hell, **even if** all the tools were available to the cows, as they are for humans.\n* Suppose the cows could surmount all of these impossible barriers and somehow **agree** to kill themselves as a species in exactly 24 hours-- they would fail here because the farmers would *simply* step in and effortlessly stop this behavior due to the sheer domination they hold over the cow species.\n* Suppose the cows somehow, through sheer happenstance, surmounted even this barrier and all died tomorrow. What would happen? Are there strong reasons to think the farmers of Earth wouldn't just have their project right back up and running in a few years? \n\n\nCows are **truly doomed** to a life of being farmed and tortured, barring truly **extreme** global happenstance that either destabilizes or revolutionizes humanity. Once you appreciate this, you can extrapolate the exact same ideas to the human predicament, because they are all parallel, it's just that humanity faces even more complex problems than the ones cows face because the nature of the \"game-ification\"(the progressive expressions and interactions between different strategies, as expressed by traits\/phenotypes on the individual+group level) humanity is under within the universe's hierarchy is more advanced.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1619129273,"distinguished":null,"edited":1619129745.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gvhxbla","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mqt2xv","locked":false,"name":"t1_gvhxbla","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_gutimsg","permalink":"\/r\/AskAnAntinatalist\/comments\/mqt2xv\/is_antinatalism_a_defeatist_ideology\/gvhxbla\/","retrieved_utc":1628188230,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AskAnAntinatalist","subreddit_id":"t5_287k4n","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Them: \"Hello\" -- Me: \"Hi-- what **is this**, exactly?\"\n\nI think many of your frustrations would go away if you reconcile some ideas that you are taught as a child, with what reality appears to suggest. One such idea is that \"The world is a fine place, full of fine people, and things are getting better\". Or that \"normal\" exists. Or that some arbitrator decides what \"mental health\" is. I'm not saying there isn't such a thing as mental health-- clearly the difference between buying a hammer on amazon to complete your new shelf, vs. buying it to smash your fingers into a fine paste and then bake it to have with a side of spinach, at minimum, says something important about a person's brain. I'm just saying there's no reason to be certain that some body of human beings in a random year on Earth somehow sealed this concept in stone. We should stop taking ideas like these for granted. It becomes more and more clear to me with each day that we live in a \"the lunatics run the asylum\" kind of scenario, and that's crystal clear to anyone who has spent enough time in the mental health system and had the mental energy to apply criticism to the system.

Expecting reality to be \"good\" or \"sane\" *will* drive you insane-- so the quicker you stop that, the less you'll suffer pointlessly. As for the philosophy, I can't be of much help here, since we basically can't really falsify solipsism, the idea that only we exist. There's also the [egocentric predicament](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Egocentric_predicament) where even if solipsism is untrue, we're stuck in our own \"tunnelvision\", unable to **truly** understand other people who are *themselves* stuck in their own \"tunnelvision\".

One can't genuinely express an emotion by choice. We can't \"choose\" to be angry over something worth being angry about(although we can be angry for bad or good reasons, of course), as subjects, and we can't choose to feel the pain or joy of someone in a genuine way. If someone has some kind of inner experience that can be related to, we either relate to them, or we don't. This is quite different from *failing* to feel an emotion worth feeling. For instance, someone could dislike someone and feel no empathy at first, but later, discover something about their life, or how much they've suffered, and have a change of heart, and now deeply relate to this person they once despised. This kind of gradual process is **not** what I'm talking about here.\n\nIf we don't feel empathy when confronted with overt suffering, that *says something* about us, at least during the moment where the empathy can or can't occur. If someone sees you bleeding out on the road in the middle of nowhere, for them to have genuine empathy in that moment, their brain doesn't ever go \"Hmmm... now, should I feel bad here, or not?\" Either this person feels bad, or they don't. If someone's brain *could* go into the former kind of deliberation mode where they **consider** empathy, weigh pro's and cons, and to what degree, that would be sort of like psychopathic behavior. Subjectively, once complete, it could seem like real empathy is being felt from that person's perspective, but what's really felt is a kind of post-hoc belief, a kind of empathy loophole for someone who lacked genuine empathy in the first place. When we speak of empathy we really describe a genuine process, like with anything else. Consider any other emotional state:\n\nSadness. A mother loses her child to a tragic accident, and nothing. Nothing at all. Just goes about her day as if nothing happened. She's not in some traumatic episode here to be clear, where she's dissociating from the horror of losing her child. Nothing like that. She's **fully aware** she lost her child and it's identical to her as if she drove to her favorite coffee shop anticipating a cappuccino only to find it was closed that day. Then, after you ask her about it she says, \"Oh okay. I'll **turn on** my sadness.\" Immediately, she falls to the floor weeping and sobbing. She really believes it, too. If we could use sophisticated neuroscience to study her brain, we'd see she believes it. But there's something off about this, isn't there? It's just bizarre. This isn't how genuine emotion works. Emotions aren't a decision you can just make-- they helplessly show us and others the \"color\" of an event in our lives. They can't just be a calculated effort, because there's something cheap, or fake, or manipulative about that.\n\nI'm not arguing that emotions or even empathy are explicitly \"good\" in every area of our lives-- we can have emotions for bad reasons like I said, and we can have empathy with negative outcomes too, I'm just expressing what I think makes these states \"make sense\".","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1619290521,"distinguished":null,"edited":1619290736.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gvqknov","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mxj46y","locked":false,"name":"t1_gvqknov","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_mxj46y","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/mxj46y\/empathy_is_a_switch\/gvqknov\/","retrieved_utc":1628160137,"score":2,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Someone like Ted Bundy, according to me, was a B-grade psychopath, but notice if you ask anyone to start listing down names when they think of \"ultimate psychopath\", Bundy will be near the top of everyone's list. This is just one of a few barriers to break through to get to the idea I'm expressing. If you re-orient your understanding of psychopathy to *simply* be a domination system that simultaneously is camouflaged, you get to what is, in game theoretical terms, the **perfection** of power, given enough time for evolutionary forces to work. \n\nThere's nothing anyone can come up with in game terms that beats such a thing, all else equal. To get this part, simply pick your favorite high profile athlete. Suppose you have a perfect simulation to play with, so you clone this athlete, into copies A and B. Copy B is the athlete as they exist in their prime in our world, but copy A is this athlete **plus** the following enhanced traits:\n\n* Domination\n* Callousness\n* Self-absorption\n* Self-aggrandizing\n* Manipulation\n* Deception\n* Charm\n\nThese are some bread and butter psychopathic traits. Notice I said charm, and not the more common *superficial* charm? This is one of several ways psychopaths become downplayed as \"broken\" or \"pathological\", when in reality, they are simply like ... in video game terms, the \"most overpowered class\" one can pick, if our reality were a game, and domination of our reality was the win condition. Back to clones A and B-- we run these two athletes in 1v1 simulation against each other. But to add to the crucial conditions here on Earth, there is no referee(after all, there is no referee on Earth either, if you \"win\" earth, you write the rules, and enforce them-- it's purely about power). What would the results look like? It's pretty clear that the psychopathic athlete would completely destroy the less psychopathic athlete(notice I said *less*, not \"Non-psychopathic\"?-- This is because every star athlete you can think of on Earth **already** possesses a great deal of psychopathic traits as a function of being so skilled at their sport-- if they were less psychopathic, the idea of them being a star would be incoherent-- but again, a re-orientation of what psychopathy is may be required to grasp this point-- if you look on youtube for a video of Lionel Messi dribbling the ball with finesse between 3 defenders with ease, you'll the traits domination, manipulation, deception, fearlessness, charm, self-aggrandizing, self-absorption, etc-- this is nothing more than psychopathy in action, albeit in a pro-social and familiar to us setting).\n\nClone A, the psychopathic clone, would play just as well as Clone B, except they would cheat better at the rules of the game(Clone B would be forced to play B the rules-- this is what a commitment to ethics means, and one of the things that separate those high on the psychopathic spectrum from those low on it). They would be more motivated to cause clone B harm, while also having more endurance at receiving harm from Clone B or even motivated to be harmed(this is the psychopathic trait of sadomasochism which brilliantly combines a motivation to cause harm, but a resilience to those who mirror your harm strategy). They would be skilled at faking their moves in a way Clone B could only dream of. Their ego would provide them with such immense confidence that would break down even a superstar like Clone B, who has some semblance of self-awareness and can genuinely worry about what they are. They would never feel bad about utterly destroying Clone B, where as Clone A may have some sort of sportsmanship present where there's no need to \"Rub things in\". Psychopathic traits are simply advantageous in any game state that can't **perfectly** punish them-- which is precisely our world. Yes, we have selection pressure, but this only really applies to sociopathic traits, which I distinguish from psychopathic as the overtly malevolent features. Think of the sociopath as the brash thug who will have no issues beating someone in public with a baseball bat, \"for the fun of it\", and signals what they are overtly. A psychopath is the camouflaged version, containing social finesse, and so on. They're the kind neighbor with a torture dungeon in their basement, or the superficially philanthropic CEO causing immense suffering to the lives of billions, consciously and intentionally, purely for profit.\n\nAs time goes by, psychopathy perfects like [so](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv). Now, you could be thinking-- but doesn't psychopathic detection also become perfected? Isn't it an even match, like a lion who gets better at running down gazelles via selection pressure, but gazelles also get better at outrunning lions via selection pressure? Early on, sure. But eventually, there is a threshold where psychopathy simply wins. It dominates social systems. It establishes power. It becomes dynastic. It understands how the world functions as a result of this power, and seeks to influence the world vs. other apex psychopaths. All of this becomes a selection game for world hegemony, with the \"gazelles\"(You, me, etc) being utterly powerless to do anything about what dominates our world-- which is where we are today.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1619323482,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gvs9jvo","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_mxkmw7","locked":false,"name":"t1_gvs9jvo","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_gvs35hr","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/mxkmw7\/chauvin_as_the_stranger\/gvs9jvo\/","retrieved_utc":1628153664,"score":3,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Our genes, via purely arbitrary conditions, were actually *rewarded* for being psychotic. For instance with the evolution of belief, we come from species that roamed the grasses of Savannah, which contained predators. When the grass rustled, some of us probably expressed, through random arbitrary genetic mutations, a desire to investigate. Or some of us thought \"It's just the wind\". If the rustling was harmless, like a rabbit foraging, or just the wind, we would live a few more minutes. Genes are happy here. If it was a predator like a tiger, we would almost certainly die. Genes sad-- no offspring, and any previously acquired offspring would have bad odds due to parent dead. Others of us expressed another arbitrary strategy-- we just assumed it was a tiger. We didn't perform some sort of logical calculus-- evolution has no time for that. We *just* believed. Every time, it was a tiger. Sure, these people would run away from the wind or from rabbits, but they would have a much better chance of living than the investigator, and that means having kids that live, who play the game all over again. Maybe the investigators had high IQ's, but the high IQ doesn't save you when you get hit by a tiger at motorcycle speeds and then torn apart. If you were a schizophrenic here and it suddenly occurred to you that an evil wind god exists and his portent was the grass rustling, and then told everyone in your tribe your revelation, your idea would have adaptive benefit, even if it was complete bullshit. From here, you could torture everyone who questioned this faith of yours as heretics, and this would be even better-- not only are you a survivor, not only do you write the rules of reality as a schizophrenic(or a holder of ancient psychotic ideas), but you are in a position to torture people who disagree(If you're a carrier of psychopathic genes here, you essentially have super powers when it comes to this task). Maybe add in something into the holy text about spreading your seed and multiplying? Even more genetic proliferation, great. Now you can create some memes about the virtues of hard, meaningless work, get the largest economy, and conquer the planet. Now *that's* power, and genes would salivate in ecstasy at this if they could.\n\nIt's not just the fact that our genes, and therefore we, are disposed to psychosis. The genes produced **memes** for thousands of years, which were expressions of psychosis. We are culturally psychotic, because psychosis is good for survival.\n\nWhat does it mean if psychosis is good for survival? Well, one possibility is it could suggest that something about reality is deeply negative. So negative, that being simply *in touch* with it, causes you to survive poorly. If this were hell, then being psychotic would be a kind of relief, and this trait would favorably move forward in genetic terms, while being in touch with the reality of hell would be a disadvantage.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1619810176,"distinguished":null,"edited":1619810672.0,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gwgk8ya","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n1ej5o","locked":false,"name":"t1_gwgk8ya","no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_n1ej5o","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/n1ej5o\/we_are_always_drunk\/gwgk8ya\/","retrieved_utc":1628017805,"score":1,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

You can assign any value to the symbol \"2\".\n\n\nThe way you're using the words \"can assign\" are strange here. We don't care for example if someone \"can assign\" any meaning to anything. You can meet a new person for the first time, and they can greet you with \"I'd love to torture you with fire some day\", as they flash a sadistic, intense stare at you, and upon further conversation they could say: \"Oh! That was simply me assigning a different meaning to the phrase 'torture you with fire'. That's just the sort of metaphor I like to use to mean 'treat you to a barbecue in our backyard'.\" And then when asked about the sadistic glare, they tell you that it was simply a confusion on your part, and they have no malicious intentions towards you. Perhaps you've both assigned different meanings to concepts?\n\nOf course, this is all insane, because this is not how reality works. This is not the sort of semantic game we care about. Things have meaning whether or not people can play semantic games or not. A nihilist or anti-realist is simply confused about this fact-- they think that just because someone can, by fiat say \"2+2=5\", that \"2+2=4\" is somehow brittle and untrue. But things have meaning *by definition*-- you can see this with the simplest case-- your own consciousness. The lights are on for you, right now. You are conscious as you read this sentence, by definition. Is it possible to *believe* one is not conscious while *still* having read this sentence? Yes, of course, and there are explanations for this, like Cotard's syndrome, where people believe that parts of their body are missing, or that they are dying, dead, or don't exist. It's perfectly possible to be psychotic as well and see a scene of torture and say \"It looks like the torturer is trying to help the torture victim, but the victim is refusing help\", but none of this matters when it comes to what is meaningful and what isn't. It's **untrue** that the torturer is \"trying to help\"-- the fact that someone can be dishonest or confused here doesn't change this fact. Does the Earth orbit the sun? This is a true or false statement, the answer to which is \"Yes\". If it turns out that the sun is a hologram, cleverly placed here by an advanced species of malicious aliens seeking to confuse us about the nature of the cosmos, it's possible to answer the question with \"No\" or \"It's complicated\". What isn't possible, is for both of these to be true, or for neither of these things to be true. There's a single representation of reality, and meaning is what describes this singular, total representation. As subjects, we are attempting to map this single representation of reality, and words, numbers, their meanings, etc., are a way to do this.","can_gild":true,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"collapsed_reason_code":null,"comment_type":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1619812592,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"gwgpekl","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_n1obku","locked":false,"name":"t1_gwgpekl","no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t1_gwgimkb","permalink":"\/r\/Pessimism\/comments\/n1obku\/what_is_the_most_frightening_interpretation_of\/gwgpekl\/","retrieved_utc":1628017534,"score":8,"score_hidden":false,"send_replies":true,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Pessimism","subreddit_id":"t5_2rpbb","subreddit_type":"public","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[]}

Please let me explain.\n\nThere's no one in their right mind who would disagree with your statements that \"Some rich guy\" is sending people to fight wars and that it's all just a chain of mental illness. First, the soldier is mentally ill to even attempt to fight war. At minimum they're psychotic or delusional or naiive because they don't understand the gravity of war. They find themselves in boot camp, where they are essentially abused and groomed to be cannon fodder+killing machines(not a surprise... it's sort of... their job, right? This is what you would expect from this system to be logically coherent at all). \n\nThen, they go war, where the gravity sets in for the first time. \"Oh. Right. This *isn't* Call of Duty. This is real. That guy begging for his life with his guts hanging out? That's a suffering person.\" This itself prompts *more* mental illness. It's again not a mystery that someone does not get **more sane**, rather than **less**, in such an environment. But this is all just the singular subjective level of the soldier. Then we get to your rich guys, right? This is all a strategic move to dominate parts of the planet, and again we can talk about the relationship between money and power.\n\nBut we still haven't escaped mental illness-- because it turns out to be a thing that is even in a *position* to dominate parts of planets, is itself a kind of mental illness-- it's an expression of traits that are functionally identical to psychopathy(Domination, Callousness, Fearlessness, Sadomasochism, Low risk-aversion, Self-aggrandizement, Egomania, Deception, etc).\n\nWhen people say \"It's deeper\" than some rich guy, what they're asking is:\n\n\"What *causes* this evil situation we're describing in **the first place** ? Why is it that rich psychopaths fight over the domination of the planet, torturing hundreds of billions of things at minimum, in the process?\"\n\nWhat we're doing here on reddit when we argue with someone for sport, expressing passive aggressive remarks, rudeness, calling someone's intelligence or knowledge into question, play dishonest semantic games, and in general attack each other, is **we are playing this exact game** that these \"evil rich people\" are playing.
