Why? Because the king benefits from lots of little ants running around. Even if the ant is stuck to a hospital bed, producing almost nothing other than piss, shit, and agony, this ant *cannot* be allowed to peacefully go. This suffering ordeal is very lucrative. Nurses get paid. Drugs get purchased. Electric company gets paid. The **gears** keep turning. Like a cow is enslaved and milked, the milk of humanity **is** suffering in the system. When you consider the *total* population, the gains are truly massive for forced torture. Progress here is awarded not because some power structures are truly ethically superior, progress is awarded when some power structures become **dominant**, then they can afford to *loosen* these restrictions(ie, the right to abortion, the right to gay marriage, in first world nations, vs. death penalty for homosexuality, abortion illegal, death penalty for violating religious rules, in nations under threat of being dominated). This is why progress is an **illusion**.\n\nDoes an ant wish to not have her child because she realizes it would be a mistake? The King can't have that. The priests and magicians of the kingdom need to spread the meme that abortion is the worst thing in the world, and deny the woman her future or autonomy because that's a future potential taxpayer, worker, soldier, consumer, programmer of AI\/machine learning. Even a homeless person sitting in filth on a wealthy city's street has value: To make others feel like things are going well. This is the homeless person's 'milk' for which they suffer daily as they are farmed. \n\nThis is the burden of the average person when you have a universe which promotes psychopathy to ascend the throne of humanity. The good king\/queen is a myth in stories which benefit the elite, because in reality, the good kings\/queens had their food poisoned by the evil royal family member who stole the throne, while making themselves look like the hero. This is why psychopathy always beats non-psychopathy. This is called \"natural selection\" and has been going on for millions of years, to produce the world we see today: Evil in charge. It gets worse-- the laws of physics prevent *any* other state other than a continual perfection and evolution of evil. Good *literally* cannot win in this universe due to the way game theory works here(cheaters are favored over non cheaters: Psychopathy is the *best* framework for winning), and the presence of entropy(things continually break down naturally, which is inherently 'evil', but also serves to ally itself with actual evil actors, to give them shade).\n\nAll progress is the illusion produced by the apex of human domination having room to throw such bones to the dogs. Every day is a day where evil distills further while the illusion of progress becomes more and more compelling. The future involves a perfect obfuscation of evil with an unshakable illusion of good -- a perfect dystopia.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1564639796,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":1,"gildings":{"gid_2":1},"id":"evo6u0g","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ck8fvr","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_ck8fvr","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/ck8fvr\/xpost_rdepression_suicideprevention_is_just\/evo6u0g\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1573389841,"score":10,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":1}

Homo sapiens is a psychotic and psychopathic species, and we all share these traits to some degree. The perfection of these traits sit atop of human hierarchies. Altruism\/cooperation is a meme and phenotype which appears to benefit homo sapiens, but is co-opted to ultimately benefit apex psychopathy(the most powerful apes) and ensures dominion over cooperative apes-- a non-zero sum\/negative sum game.\n\n* Entropy ensures psychopathy(evil) wins, and good(rationality, logic, truth, ethics) loses -- it is far easier to gain power being evil than good(often unconsciously, of course, self-deception ensures evil doesn't know it is evil for adaptive purposes -- an example of how the universe favors anti-truth\/psychosis). It's far easier to maintain power than get it(Evil gets more powerful as one moves 'forward' in spacetime). And it's far easier to break things than to fix them(evil will ruin 10 good things for every 1 good thing created by good).\n\n* DNA, self replicating systems, and spacetime serve as a substrate for a deterministic meat grinder that results in colossal [pain](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=13) and [suffering](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3271). This negative property is not reduced, but only obfuscated with time, because obfuscation is an evolutionary property of evil, which only gets better and better due to selective pressures, like [camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) in nature.\n\nIt should go without saying that I deeply want Pinker's books to depict reality. This isn't a representation of the world that anyone ethically inclined would ever *want* to be true. It's simply my best effort at honestly describing what I see going on, even if it is a heavy psychological load to bear. I don't really expect people with friends, families, hopeful futures, etc, to ever come to terms with my argument. They are simply doomed to fail to see things as they are because they were unlucky in being lucky(And no, optimism is not simply another flavor of perspective to pessimism, a strong selection bias exists for one but not the other).

The prognosis here is unsatisfying for everyone, unfortunately. It's falsifiable in principle, but very unlikely in practice. The claim being made is that this is essentially an obfuscatory hell where evil deterministically wins and sabotages truth and ethics(unconsciously and consciously). Let's warm ourselves up trying to make room for falsifiability in another really tough philosophical idea: That we have no free will. What would it take for us to have free will? Well, non-determinism isn't enough. We may need a universe that is *non-causal*, but even then the idea of free will may be incoherent. The reason I mention this is because that's the fundamental sort of philosophical claim I'm making: The universe produces evil *and* gives it an edge. It's philosophical rather than scientific because it presupposes moral realism. If one doesn't believe being evil is possible, then they could just see what I see about the universe and instead say \"Everything is working as intended: CEO's and millitaries and governments and intelligence agencies and religions and thinktanks, all comprised of Apex-apes exhibiting phenotypes which ensure robust competition to dominate reality on Earth. I see no issues here. Humans torture other species on [industrial scales](https:\/\/youtu.be\/6jWe6Tx89GU?t=3340), sure it's bad, but things are getting better. :)\"\n\nI tie entropy and ethics into this to make a philosophical argument: The universe is 1) Evil-promoting 2) Truth obscuring. \n\nIt is truth obscuring because the thing that attempts to process the truth, apes such as ourselves, evolved to *ignore* truths that may or may not appear before us, and also distort or inhibit the truth in regards to our interactions with other apes. The reason is, this was strategically appropriate -- natural selection's only rule, if it had any. There are many truths that are simply poorly compatible with survival -- maladaptive. Evolution:\n\n* Club another ape over the head, fuck their partner, eat their flesh. You win in evolutionary terms.\n* You exist in a cooperative social structure. Cooperate, then when no one is looking, club another ape over the head, fuck their partner, eat their flesh.\n* You exist in a cooperative social structure. Cooperate, and manipulate the other ape instead of killing them, fuck their wife, don't eat their flesh, but make him operate a farm to grow you crops.\n* You exist in a cooperative social structure. Feign benevolence, enslave the other apes, build the pyramids. Fuck the best wife possible.\n* You exist in a cooperative social structure. Sign a treaty, break it the next morning and sack the adjacent Kingdom. Rewrite history with your power.\n\n\nThe common illusory element here is this 'cooperative social structure'. It doesn't exist, it's simply a shade for domination. At the same time, evil is distilled further and further throughout the centuries. Progress is an illusion, a bone thrown to serf apes. The middle of the pyramid gets fairly choice cuts to dine on, because their role, their 'milk', is to bear the meme that progress and optimism are the paths forward. The light of these ideas certainly feels warm and bright, but it also casts a shade -- the real beneficiary of the light. The thing which wins(has already won) the entire game hides in this shade.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1565228379,"distinguished":null,"edited":1565233344,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ew9o2e2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cmdmhk","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ew79w1w","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/cmdmhk\/making_sense_podcast_164_cause_effect_sam_harris\/ew9o2e2\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1573761934,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

What I wrote are some very specific ideas but the loose ideas, questions like \"Are we living in a dystopia?\" \"Is the nature of reality *bad*?\" should be asked at all times, because in the subjective experience, there's no stamp of approval that says \"Things seem fine\/things seem to be improving, *therefore* they are.\" \n\nEvaluating the sinister is essentially a never-ending intellectual duty, but engaging in this duty is maladaptive, as I pointed out earlier. It harms survival, it leaves an unbearably bitter taste in the mouth, and it breaks the metaphorical back of the thinker. It's a very heavy and unnecessary labor.\n\nThe Matrix does so much harm intellectually to this problem, because it spreads the meme of the hero who bears the heaviest burden and saves everything, but the difference between this fiction and reality is not that the dystopia is fictional, the dystopia is very real. The reality we live I'd argue is *more* dystopian than that of the Matrix. The difference is, in the movies, you take the red pill and learn Kung Fu and sleep in a badass ship with compatriots. In real life, you lose everything in life and die alone and with suicidal depression. If someone told you the cost of knowing truth was: 1) No Kung fu 2) No cool fighting\/compatriots 3) Losing everyone close to you, friends, family, your job, etc. Would you still value truth above everything else? Almost certainly not, everyone is doomed(blessed?) to eat illusory steak, whether they make the choice consciously or whether evolutionary drives protect their psychology for them.\n\nThe only people who get to experience the esoteric knowledge of the malevolent world are those who already had a bad life, and the nature of reality was exposed, and fit like a key into a lock. Or it is an epiphany revealed by sudden, unfortunate events, like the case of [Hisashi Ouchi](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/IiLBH). Ouchi was a nuclear technician, who probably had a normal life up until his incident. If you asked him before the accident, he may have expressed a progressive(to some degree) and optimistic(to some degree) attitude. Society was incredible, look at all of this progress that didn't exist? Look at this cool stuff. Until the tragic accident. Now, surely, after his chromosomes were obliterated and he was in excruciating pain, they would have given him a lethal dose of morphine, right? Surely, after he began screaming and begging for death, they would have done it, right? No. Those 83 days crystallized reality for Ouchi in a way that he was oblivious to before. He saw the world as the victims of reality see it, no longer as a beneficiary of a superficial social game of charades that benefits kings and queens. He knew that he existed as a pawn for someone else's gain, as they pumped fluids into his body 24 hours a day and patched his skin which seeped plasma. But, surely, there are those who have a good life, right? Is this simply a mutually equivalent 'flavor' of perspective? Is a good life also poised to see all the wonderful elements of reality? No, and here's why. It's very simple why, and it's the following crucial next sentence:\n\n The badness of reality makes a *farce* of the goodness, in a way that the goodness does *not* absolve the badness. \n\nAn example of this is, suppose you're having a peak human experience, just sheer ecstatic bliss, truly meaningful hedonic epiphany that only gets better and better. Now imagine someone taps you on the shoulder, and shows you a tablet livestreaming the child rape that is undoubtedly occurring as I write this sentence(and again, as you read it, alas). Something like the experience of the child described in [this video](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=986)(Graphic sexual abuse warning). If you're not under the influence of powerful drugs to produce this experience in a way that totally detaches you from reality, and are of sound psychology, your experience is suddenly ruined. Your beaming smile wanes. Your hedonic scale may have just plummeted below baseline, in fact. You feel the urge to vomit, a strategic trick your body is capable of that evolved for surviving the worst moments, the ultimate evolutionary \"changing of the subject\".\n\nNow, what happens when we reverse this? What happens when instead your subjectivity is tuned to the lowest abyss of human misfortune? Something like what happened to [Junko Furuta](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Murder_of_Junko_Furuta) or [Elizabeth Fritzl](https:\/\/youtu.be\/1fU725kmUk8?t=5). What happens if we magically interject during a particularly torturous moment, with footage of a happy family or couple, absolutely beaming with delight, love, tears of joy, ecstatic bliss, radiating genuine warmth? Perversely, it almost makes things *worse*. It certainly doesn't *help*. It frames things in such a way as to make hell even more absurd and therefore hellish. The experience of hell is not made better by the fact that good things happen -- hell is *perfectly* compatible with good things. It is the good things that are *exclusively* a perversion of subjective experience given the evil that exists in the world. This is why there is no real \"pessimism bias\" like there is optimism bias, a specific kind of highly psychologically and evolutionarily adaptive trait. The contrast to this is not pessimism bias, but depressive realism, the idea that the depressed state *is* to be in touch with reality, and not being in a panic, not experiencing paralyzing anxiety, not crushed under the weight of depression, simply being calm, collected, 'normal' -- this is the real psychosis.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1565231218,"distinguished":null,"edited":1565231964,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ew9u6cb","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cmdmhk","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ew9oe3r","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/cmdmhk\/making_sense_podcast_164_cause_effect_sam_harris\/ew9u6cb\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1573764851,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Ultimately *whichever* path leads to to less truth and justice, is the path that should be avoided. That may not be universally answered with \"it is *always* wrong to bring a child into the world\"(hard AN). To me, that would be like saying it is *always* wrong to wake someone up who is sleeping. If you play with the dials here, you can construe being awoken to be being born. Of course, the devil is in the details, and dying in agony from violence and drifting peacefully to sleep each night are subjectively night and day, but on a purely fundamental level, they are the same in the sense that you are roused into reality only to be obliterated again. The quality of the experience, and the duration, repetition, and other variables obviously differ.\n\nMy specific antinatalism acknowledges that bringing children into *this* universe is a wrong, but it's more complicated. The major problem is that the wrong people are bringing children into the world. It could be arguably *more* ethical, if anti-natalists swapped with natalists 1:1 at random. The most selfish, aggressive, dishonest, unethical, and confused people, in general, are having children. Those who are lucky(unlucky) enough to come to the correct conclusion that this universe is not a good place, but even worse than that, *cannot* be good, are only operating at the memetic level while the more dominant strategy operates on both the memetic and genetic level -- a clear edge, and something that may ultimately do *more* harm than if all antinatalists simply reproduced. The universe we live in naturally kills ethics. It kills vegetarians and enslaves them, for example, as you see in nature. If we were to rewind to the conditions of 10,000 years ago in human history, and armed all homo sapiens alive with just axes, the same exact axe, and said \"Let the best strategy win\", and some huge set of humans used the axes to harvest plants and focus all of their thoughts on being as ethical as possible, these apes would **lose** because very quickly one would realize that there is an army of axe wielding lunatic apes ready to not only kill you, but eat your flesh for nourishment. We are the **product** of a much more complicated game that is *essentially* the previous scenario. The apes and ancestors of apes who were killed or eaten throughout history don't live today, or their genes live as a cattle-class of humans. Just like the cows which live today *literally* are cattle that enjoy continuing their genetic lines at the cost of being enslaved by [psychopaths](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3338). \n\nImagine if you had 7 billion cows who roamed free on free range farms(but were eventually brutally slaughtered), and they all spoke English, and did things like philosophy, used their money which they earned selling their milk to buy Cow Flakes for breakfast, and mated freely rather than were forcefully inseminated like factory farm cows. Imagine if one or two hundred thousand of these cows somehow stopped reproducing because they considered this whole 'farm' scenario to be deeply negative, and thought it was harmful to bring cows into this giant slaughterhouse where one feels awful that they need to suffer just to sell their milk to eat stupid cow flakes-- what would this mean for the farmer, who understands Darwinian evolution? The farmer would say, \"Great! No more *problematic* cows. Only nice obedient cows who buy Cow Flakes and obediently sell their milk.\" Perhaps there would be future disgruntled cows, yes, but the meme of \"this farm is hell\" will diminish with these antinatalist cows. The winner is the farmers, because their game continues.\n\nThe future is essentially one where hell becomes more and more obscured, while being more and more prevalent. This is why, unlike others, my antinatalism doesn't give me some sort of comfort. It only adds to depression, because every move one makes appears to be a 'losing move', and this includes me writing these posts. But then why do I continue to write them? I don't have a good answer other than we appear to be *poised* to make these sorts of 'losing moves' in the way we evolved. We are hard-wired to yell, \"Fire! Fire! There's a fire in this building!\" even when we understand that we are on the 95th floor with nothing but intense flames under us, just as the people in the World Trade Center towers were on September 11th. We have irrational brains that not only torture us to survive longer, but these brains reliably *produce* suffering causally in their actions, especially with their good intentions. We want a jet or helicopter to scramble and rescue us -- which didn't happen on 9\/11. Nonetheless, I'm sure many people, after the initial shock of the impact on those upper floors, told themselves something like \"Just stay calm. There's always *hope*.\" And who would blame them, after they were handed plate after plate of pro-hope memes, like Disney films, happy endings, and superhero stories throughout life? It's because of these memes, and our faulty firmware, that we may be paving the way to hell by living another day.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1565243051,"distinguished":null,"edited":1565243816,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ewag83q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cmmcvr","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_cmmcvr","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/cmmcvr\/do_you_reflect_on_your_antinatalist_views\/ewag83q\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1573775358,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Bad luck. I only have very vague advice to offer. Hold truth and intellectual honesty as your highest virtue. Even when the truth threatens to rob you of everything you have -- your friends, your family, your future, your hobbies, your own life. You can either be a slave to something that isn't true because it makes you feel a certain way, or you can become a slave to the only thing worth being a slave to: the truth. Once you have the truth, you can be empowered to move forward(or not take another step, if that's the best move). Without the truth, you are robbed of reality, to stumble around in darkness. Ignorance is an injury which not only harms you, but harms others -- at 16 you should be seeing this all around you, but you are burdened still with the ignorance of a highly confusing environment, as we all are to some significant degree until we die.\n\nCrucial topics: \n\n* Evolutionary biology \n* Psychology(personality disorder, the psychopathic phenotype, cognitive biases like self deception and their evolutionary roots)\n* Philosophy(Plato's The Allegory of the Cave -- I learned this exactly when I was your age, at 16, and without it I'd be deeply confused about epistemology. Also, start to try to understand the illusion of free will)\n* World history(a big picture book like Sapiens\/Guns, Germs... will suffice)\n* Game theory(Prisoner's dilemma, terms like; non-zero sum, zero sum, negative sum)\n* Physics - This one is a lot to ask of you, but it would benefit you greatly to understand the concept of time(illusion, sorry, again this is a lot to swallow) and the concept of entropy(this one is easy, things basically *turn into chaos*, they move from order to disorder as one moves through time). Conceptualize reality as a large billiard table consisting of an incomprehensible amount of balls, which represent the small particles that make up everything in this universe including your eyes and brain that read this sentence, bouncing around in a precisely mathematical way.\n* ...and the concept of hierarchy(you know, like a pyramid). Apply this to the previous topics of psychology and evolutionary biology, game theory, and world history.\n\nBest of luck to you from here. Oh and:\n\n&gt;were fucked nothings going to change, the major governments of the world don't care and that itself is the problem.\n\nThey certainly care, just not about what *you* care about. Reality is a game of chess, and often you sacrifice your pawns if you're a skilled player. There is no room for ethics if one wants to win a game of chess. If one says, \"But I do not *want* to sacrifice my pieces to win... I feel *bad* for them...\" they will lose the game. That's what this is.

I've noticed that suicide occurs with people who can move from a high hedonic setpoint and then plummet, you hear this with reports like: \"They were such a bright and upbeat person... I just can't believe this happened.\" \n\nSuicide and depression function sort of like being chained to an indoor pool, not realizing it, and being boiled alive. The temperature in this analogy represents how bad life is. If you raise the temperature very gradually over the years, the hedonic treadmill kicks in and you can tolerate some awful stuff. You can *know* they are awful, but yet feel powerless to act on it because at the same time, to you, 'bad' is normal. But if you suddenly spike the temperature upwards, this sends you into a panic and demands that you *do something* about your conditions. \n\nThis 'normalcy of horror' is what it is like to be a depressive\/neurotic, like Gary or Ligotti. If you were to suddenly upload this information into the brain of a totally average person, I suspect this is the scenario that would lead to almost immediately suicide. It's the dramatic movement that causes suicide, and this is why people in scenarios like the concentration camps of WWII or North Korea don't commit mass suicide. As outsiders, we can look at things objectively and say \"This is not a life worth living\".

It just wouldn't act for its own benefit, or the benefit of the person that has it, but for the good of the wider social group.\n\nFor it to be adaptive in any sense it would need to be ultimately adaptive for *genes*, as far as I understand. I could be wrong, I only have a layman's understanding of evolution. The concept you describe of \"ruining the fun\" and being \"against the living, against evolution\" is unclear to me, could you flesh that out a little more?\n\nI have a hard time seeing how pessimism is adaptive at the individual level *and* at the group level(optimism as an adaptive trait *is* very obvious to me, on the other hand), but antinatalism is another story. The way I see antinatalism isn't necessarily as a threat to genes in general, since your example makes much more sense when we're only speaking about antinatalism. At the macro level, antinatalism becomes a kind of eugenics, which cleanses society of those with threatening ideas(either directly threatening or indirectly threatening, ie, \"Life is bad\" or \"This is *why* life is bad\" or \"Life is bad because of &lt;certain people\/systems&gt;\". Pessimism alone doesn't have this cleansing function built in, but antinatalism does since it explicitly stops the spread of the AN's genes. It would benefit a very large tribe with a population surplus, for example, to spread a very contained meme of antinatalism, because then the tribe wouldn't need to castrate people they would otherwise be incentivized to castrate. A competitive group is incentivized to promote genetic fitness, and the groups which maximize genetic fitness through memes are the groups that win, in evolutionary terms. A roadblock here is the meme: \"Eugenics is bad\" so instead, groups need to create memes which serve ultimately eugenic purposes. The richest and most powerful people on the planet are not, and will not, be antinatalists. It doesn't exist for *them*, it exists for people who they desire to be 'cleansed' from the group's gene pool, however broadly you wish to define 'the group'.\n\nA helpful thought experiment that comes to mind is imagining if cows could speak English and engage in philosophy, philosophies like Antinatalism. It would benefit the farmer who otherwise couldn't strongly dictate how cows mated and also struggled to castrate the problematic cows(Neither are true in real factory farms, of course) who understood that the industrial factory farm was a [hellscape](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3338), to let cows be antinatalist as a eugenic philosophy for the purpose of sustaining power and resource flow.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1565407302,"distinguished":null,"edited":1565407861,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ewhggan","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cmdmhk","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ewgetpr","permalink":"\/r\/IntellectualDarkWeb\/comments\/cmdmhk\/making_sense_podcast_164_cause_effect_sam_harris\/ewhggan\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1573895430,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_id":"t5_e0m2r","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/IntellectualDarkWeb","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

What matters is defining \"free\". We are not free, unless you're happy with the definition \"You don't have a gun to your head.\", which you shouldn't be happy with, since causality is the ultimate gun to your head. Every single particle in you has a gun to its head. Every thought that occurs to you, has a gun to its head. The fact that you were born where you were born, and to whom, and experienced\/interacted with what you happened to experience\/interacted with, has a gun to its head. The genes operating in you and how they are modulated have guns to their heads. There is no head without a gun to it in this universe, and even trying to imagine one outside of this universe boggles the mind.\n\nThat being said, science ultimately should be answering this question, not philosophy. Physics is good, but psychology and neuroscience are even better. The correct question is, \"What motives do people have for rejecting vs. accepting free will?\"\n\nThe answer is probably in the style of Jon Haidt's work on political affiliation where personality predicts liberal or conservative leanings. I think egocentrism\/pride\/self-absorption a big driver for belief in free will. Think of what a person who is self-absorbed\/egoic has to lose by coming to terms with no free will. Pride goes out the window. Blaming others goes out the window. Those they scapegoat, call others lazy, worthy of guilt, etc, go out the window. You can't meaningfully moralize or punish someone the way certain people do if you fully grant that everyone is just a product of states that were not chosen freely by them(You can call their behavior bad, but you can't say, \"You did a bad thing! Now you're gonna get what you deserve!\"). You can't hope someone gets raped in prison for whatever they did. The criminal justice system in the way it exists today becomes a complete farce.\n\nIf you are the sort of person who:\n\n* Has narcissistic leanings\n* Is egoic\n* Is compelled by the idea of 'the self'\n* Moralizes heavily\n* Is prideful\n* Blames others\n\nthen you are **determined** to believe in free will, barring some extreme cognitive dissonance because nothing about your psychology\/phenomenology makes sense if you appreciate the idea that there can't be free will.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1565432797,"distinguished":null,"edited":1565486824,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ewi0p37","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_bqoyu9","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_bqoyu9","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/bqoyu9\/thermodynamics_of_free_will\/ewi0p37\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1573905029,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

If I'm in an obfuscated dystopia, a very fancy and well-off North Korea, I would rather have someone like Trump be president so it's at least somewhat obvious that a lunatic is in charge and the dystopian hell of reality at least *coheres* with the face of the nation. Not endorsing Trump or any right wing vision there, this is akin to saying \"I would rather have Hitler in 2020 than the Antichrist in 2020.\"\n\nReworded again, to drill the point home: I would rather exist in the carnage filled world of 9\/11 and the Iraq war and Bush and Cheney playing \"Capture the Oil\", than in some quiet democratic 8 year presidency where nothing apparent happens. The former is less scary than the latter, because I'm not a naive moron who thinks red=evil, blue=good.

I'm sure you know people who have no idea how they actually 'are' -- this isn't exactly you since you're realizing things about yourself. That's actually great, right? There are people who have BPD and still end up in relationships, and lots of people with other *very* challenging personality disorders who also end up in relationships. I think the main variable that will determine if your BPD will ruin all of your relationships for you, is whether or not you take a problem-solving, day-to-day approach to it, rather than convince yourself it's something that cannot be improved.\n\nLet's try to just trigger the imagination on what this means for a second. What is *experience* like in the exact moment of a mood swing? Close your eyes and try to recreate that feeling, from memory. *Feel* that moment as if it's happening right now.\n\nNow try to imagine yourself *shortening* that mood-swing. I'm sure you're familiar with the feeling of 'snapping out of it'. That moment when sanity returns, and you question what you just did. That feeling of being insane a few seconds\/minutes ago. The name for being aware in that moment, *after* the mood swing, is called mindfulness. It's nothing fancy, it just means paying attention. If you were paying attention during your mood swing, you couldn't *possibly* have it the same way, right? Because just think about it. You'd immediately realize how ridiculous this was. You'd be self aware, and would ask yourself calmly, \"Wait a minute... what am I doing? Is there even a good reason to be angry\/upset\/sad\/hysteric right now?\" The answer is almost always no, and even if there is, probably not to the extreme degree that is happens, right? And certainly not for as *long* as it happens.\n\nI'm not saying you should turn of all of your emotions and become a robot, but if you can get better at mindfulness(paying attention), you can actually achieve two things: \n\n1) Decrease the *intensity* of mood swings.\n\n2) Decrease the *duration* of mood swings.\n\nThe first step isn't even hard, and that's great news, because then this would *really* suck, right? If were unlucky enough to have BPD, and then had to *also* work hard to make it better? So all this first step asks of you is to increase mindfulness by the tiniest possible unit, just the tiniest grain of sand. Just to reduce the intensity and duration of a future mood swing by a little bit. What happens if we fail to do this? What happens if... a few months from now, we have the biggest meltdown we've ever had? That's fine. We can learn from this and say, \"Let's just *remember* to try to be more mindful next time.\" Attention is like a muscle, which means we can train it. And I'll tell you how to do that now. \n\nAll you have to do, is sit down where it's relatively quiet(doesn't have to be perfectly quiet at all, some noise is fine). Close your eyes. Relax. Take a deep breath. And just **do nothing** other than **observe**. Just observe with your eyes closed. Breathe naturally, and notice how that feels. The air going in, and the air going out. You don't have to force anything since your lungs breathe for you naturally, right? Do **nothing** other than observe. If you think of something, observe that(Do nothing else, don't react to it or judge it, etc. If you do react to it, try to observe *that* reaction too.)\n\nHere's what'll happen. You'll be sitting down, and your mind will probably start to think thoughts... \"I'm bored. I'm uncomfortable. ( You'll probably shift around constantly).\" Maybe you'll think of something that bothers you. Maybe you'll think of something silly. You'll realize that it's **really hard** to observe, because we just think think think think think...\n\nSo what happens if you see that your mind just *isn't* letting you pay attention? Just pull your attention gently back to that feeling of the air going into your nose\/mouth, and into your lungs, and out. And just focus attention on that for however long you can. The thoughts will come again... and you'll \"snap out of it\", and go back to the breathe. The more you do this exercise, the better.\n\nAnd that's how we're training to 'snap out of it' in our worst moments, by the way. If you do this daily, you're going to only get better and better at it, and you have plenty of time ahead of you for that.

Is *determined* to lose, simply due to the way the universe is calibrated in regards to ethics and game theory. If you subscribe to *any* sort of ethics other than moral nihilism\/anti-realism or similar, then you live in a universe where by definition, whatever you call good cannot win over whatever you call evil.\n\nGood, by definition, is constrained by rules. Ethics. Evil, by definition, is not. A skilled cheater wins over an equally skilled ethical player in this universe. Not just wins, but this distills itself more and more the farther one is in spacetime. Evil only gets more [camouflaged](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) due to selective pressures. It perfects its phenotype of domination, callousness, deception, manipulation, charm, egoic will to power, in a way that good simply doesn't have the phenotype for. Being good is *hard*, and that is because we're *wired* for evil, since that's what *wins*. We're genetically disposed to win, and pretending that we're ethical, altruistic, both engaging in and tricking others in cooperation is one such trick. The world is essentially an obstacle course for bad actors. The better you get at evil, the less good has a chance to stop you. This was true 10,000 years ago, and this is true today.\n\nEntropy ensures that even if a perfect understanding of ethical moves appears tomorrow, granted to us by an alien oracle, it will be *easier* to prevent this plan for selfish reasons than to enact this plan because bad actors always run *with* the wind of entropy, where good actors must walk uphill, against the wind. You mathematically cannot win here if you are good. \n\nIf this is true, we should expect a universe that appears to show us great progress and potential, while simultaneously, creating a mass illusion which evil hides behind.

If *emergency* struck, and push came to shove, 'man's best friend' would turn into bone and scrap themselves, because the winningest winner would expose themselves for who they are. And, if there were no dogs, the losingest loser would become bone and scrap shortly. Which is precisely what happened with apes for hundreds of thousands of years.

Secondly, you were either the sort of person who was compelled enough by what they were reading from someone on reddit that they were pre-disposed to follow an order. Of all the people who can conceivably move their right arm, some didn't. Why? Well, due to factors ultimately outside of their control. Perhaps they have a personality type; \"Low in openness to experience\". Did they choose this about themselves? Of course not, this was ingrained in them at a very young age, a psychological survival strategy based on their early life that would dictate how their life would play out for the coming decades. \n\nAll that is left are the people who moved their arms. What caused them to move their arms? The *way* they are. They aren't the people above, people who are paralyzed, restrained, missing limbs, low in openness, they **are** the kind of person that the laws of physics allows to 'move their right arm'. The final question is: Did you freely choose the way you are? Then your choice to move your arm is not free, it's just part of a 'script'. If you move your arm right now, and then rewind the universe 5 seconds, this script will play out the exact same way, every single time. \n\nThe more interesting question is, what is the psychology of the sort of person who would reject the idea that they are a robot?

There's no conceivable way to \"kill all people\", the big red button is a fantasy scenario. Any lower gradations of this button suffer from scope and uncertainty, and are almost always poor ideas. Violence is a horrible idea, murder is a horrible idea, nuclear genocide is a horrible idea, disease is a horrible idea, etc. Just so we're clear. When you take a philosophical concept like the big red button and calibrate it perfectly(unrealistically), it only suffers from a single problem, and that is consequences in a broader picture. Does deleting planet Earth result in more sentient suffering? Then deleting Earth is wrong and the show must go on. Does deleting Earth end suffering in a spacetime sensitive context? Then your ego(and all egos) must be curbed. It's that simple. Now, this is panic inducing news to an egomaniac. If aliens show up tomorrow and say, \"Phew! Guys. Earth. Dudes. We've done it. We've figured out how to **shut this place down**.\" You:\"This place?\" \"Yes! The universe. Switch is being flipped in 5 minutes, just came to say goodbye.\" Someone utterly absorbed in ego and sunk costs and suffering from a phenomenology that is engineered by amoral, blind Darwinian processes, to **not give a shit** that this has been, and will continue to be a [meat grinder](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=21) and [sex torture chamber](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=986), will, let's just say-- not be 'thrilled'.\n\nI imagine you'd support the intervention against someone's will if they're \"ruining things\" for you? Say a gunman was just shooting at innocent people at random? You wouldn't say \"to each their own\". To each their own goes out of the window for you, because the values of the gunman are impinging on others in a way that is ethically intolerable. We are no different here, it's just that you see outliers of deranged lunatics who impinge, or threaten to impinge on what is ethical, while I see a world largely populated by delusional psychopaths and psychotics, who, part of their psychosis, cannot see their own pathology and ethical failure, as they all impinge on what is ethical with their ideas and values. It turns out this psychosis has adaptive value to the little mindless machines in every cell in your body that don't care if you or others suffer or are hallucinating.\n\n&gt;I'm not even seriously suggesting that, I just hope that you might reflect on that and then try to imagine how an actually happy person reacts to your ideas involving the same involuntary mass euthanazia, but this time they don't subscribe to the ideas that that seem to say that they should like that at all.\n\n\n This is a values problem I tried to explain to you last time. Systematized winning puts value on winning. I put value on truth. Systematized winning doesn't get me truth, it gets me winning. \"What good is it if no one gets to know your truth?\" is answered with \"What good is it if *you* don't know truth because you're so concerned with winning?\" How a happy person reacts is *one* question, but the truth is another question. I'm heavily interested in the latter, and not terribly interested in the former, because I'm not the sort of person who is going to engage in 'systematized winning' to a great degree(If telling people that their happiness is unjustified makes some of them averse to what I have to say, that's fine. I suspect that to you, that's some sort of death of rationality). To me, it's simply the product of a commitment to what is true.  There's lots of features of reality that make winning, paradoxically, losing. You can lose under a higher sophistication of assumptions by winning under a lower sophistication of assumptions. I'm instead going to engage in 'systematized truth exposure'. There's only so much bandwidth, and one must have some sort of priority here. I prioritize 'what is true' over 'what is useful'. I am an idealist before I am a pragmatist. I'm fully open to the idea that some people are better served being one over the other, I'm not claiming either is plainly better than the other.\n\n&gt;I'm glad that this naive proposition affected you so, because that means that it managed to expose at least one half of the contradiction in your worldview to you: you do feel very threatened and insulted when someone suggests a \"to each according to their beliefs\" approach to implementing the consequences of your own beliefs. Misery loves company or whatever, but you really don't like the idea that only antinatalists get summarily euthanized. Somehow.\n\nWell, you shouldn't celebrate so soon, since your view justifies and enables the most skilled dominator dominating everything alive indifferently. I'm not sure if I feel 'threatened' and 'insulted', but I am rather allergic to 'wrong', sometimes aggressively. \"To each their own\" works as an ethical strategy when ones actions don't cause\/enable misery and exploitation. And that is... precisely what happens, when you let natural selection run its course(Exhibit A: Predatory animal vs. Herbivore dynamic). If one has the sort of phenotype I described earlier, where one just doesn't **care** or has different **priorities**, then naturally, one will want to express some form of moral nihilism\/anti-realism. I hear these things are *incredibly* adaptive traits, DNA loves moral nihilism in a relatively orderly ecosystem with a police department and laws preventing murder. Moral nihilism is *amazing* for surviving another day in hell but also enabling hell, isn't it? The part that should worry you is, your moral nihilism vanishes like magic the moment morality is bearing down on your experience like a ton of bricks:\n\n The moment a sadist arrives at your door, wakes you up, binds your feet and arms, and drags you to the kitchen, turns on the burner, and plays the game \"How long can we burn the face before consciousness is lost?\" to a degree of skill that becomes more unbelievable with each passing day, your moral nihilism just wafts away in a breeze containing the scent of the Maillard reaction. You will forgive me to predict that your life has been rather... ego-fulfilling, up to this point, where you've not met with sufficiently jarring opportunities for ethical epiphany, whether this is literally true from the point of view of experience, or true from the point of view of whatever is operating in your brain from a Darwinian perspective. In other words, either you are spoiled(and therefore delusional), or you're high enough on the psychopathic gradient to fail to see what matters in ethical terms, because this is expedient for your survival. There's room for both. Sometimes we're just unlucky though, and a hard life is what grooms the psychopathy, hence the prevalence of abuse in human societies. Another failure of systematized winning via stating something extremely distasteful: This universe is a negative-sum game, where even the winners are losers.\n\n&gt;Yeah, we as a society can decide that people deserve something.\n\nWe as a society can decide the Earth is flat or that God loves you. I couldn't care less about what society decides. I care about what can meaningfully, coherently, be true.

Surely this is the only intellectually honest(rational) way forward? The first point worth mentioning is that you're continuing to argue with a strawman, and I'm continuing to humor you. We haven't entertained my side of this argument, only a possible reductive conclusion of the claim I make which **you** assert. I shall continue to humor this strawman for you, if it means solving your doubt.\n\n The irony here for you here is, if someone advocates for turning Earth into lifeless rubble is met with the similar notion, \"But, how about we instead turn *only those* who want Earth to be a lifeless rubble, into lifeless rubble?\" rejects this idea, they should not be surprised when others who don't want to turn Earth into a lifeless rubble, also reject the proposition.\" Being surprised here(or perturbed in some other way) exposes something important to you about the position.\n\nIt's unclear if you're simply saying \"This is a bad strategy\" or if you're saying \"This is therefore wrong\", but this is more or less what you appear to be amused by.\n\nWhy does this hilariously miss the point?\n\n* It's a strawman, for starters, since no one is advocating for turning the Earth into a lifeless rubble. The only important argument is: Are the conditions on this planet ethically inexcusable insofar that the earth **should** be turned into a lifeless rubble. The distinction here is can vs. should, since the Earth cannot be turned into a lifeless rubble even if we all agreed that it should, and tried our hardest to do so. This may be completely unintuitive to someone suffering from a denial of death, ego-filled anxiety, sunk costs, etc. For that I have no solution other than continue to repeat phrases like \"Sunk costs\" and \"Ego-filled anxiety\" in the hopes of triggering some self-awareness.\n\n* It ignores the ethical claim I'm making. I posed a hypothetical to you where aliens had esoteric knowledge you were poised to be ignorant of-- the knowledge that we *should* turn off the universe. Conveniently, you **reframed the hypothetical** to suit your own needs rather than engaging in a way that is committed to discovering what is true, where it's you all along who is a cool-headed skeptic, and the aliens are just morons who may ruin your fun. Cute, but this is not what I'm asking you. Again: I'm asking you about a scenario where someone is definitively certain(in a 2+2=4 sense), that the universe should be turned off. I'm asking you consider the subjectivity of both parties, those in the know, and those not in the know. Anyone ignorant here *will* be skeptical and conservative, and say, \"Hold on a minute...\" But anyone in the know, won't. That's what esoteric knowledge is.\n\nThis isn't meant to be an analogy to our world in regards to the epistemic claim that existence should end, but it is an analogy to how esoteric knowledge changes what is\/appears rational.\n\n&gt;It looks like your tortured realization that all life is suffering turns into a cruel mockery of itself if people are allowed to disagree and opt-out!\n\nFor contrast consider:\n\n\"The idea that all life should be free and unimpeded turns into mockery of itself if people are allowed to disagree and out-out.\"\n\nNaturally, I wouldn't argue against Libertarian values in those terms, I simply reworded the same line of thought for you so you can see how silly it is. In case you won't catch the crucial implication, I'll spell it out for you here rather than 'wonder if you get it', like an egomaniac would. You seem to be saying that simply disagreeing with the proposition \"Life is suffering and should end\" exposes this view as somehow sinister, or pro-suffering, or absurd. These aren't good arguments against these positions. \n\nLastly, let's look at one of the more intellectually dishonest interpretations of \"The idea that all life should be free and unimpeded turns into mockery of itself if people are allowed to disagree and out-out.\" \n\nSomething like,\n\n*\"Well, opting out here means minding your business and somehow not impeding anyone's life anyway...\"*\n\nNo. No it doesn't. Opting out here precisely means impeding the lives of others. And that *doesn't* make a mockery of the Libertarian values in the precise sense that you were arguing IRT the idea that life is suffering and should stop. You can construe \"Make a mockery of\" here in the sense \"Spoils something righteous and good\", but that's *not* the sense you mean when you say 'life is bad and should end' turns into a mockery when applied to itself. Here you quite literally mean laughable and absurd, there you would mean 'a tragic spoilage of the correct path'.\n\n There are *other* reasons why Libertarian values are insane([Free will being a fantasy](https:\/\/philosophy.as.uky.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/The%20Impossibility%20of%20Moral%20Responsibility%20-%20Galen%20Strawson.pdf) for starters), and they certainly relate the way in which life naturally impedes life, but the it's far from the case that righteous Libertarianism defeats itself and becomes un-righteous because of it's own premises.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1565747139,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ewtk9co","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cp3ab3","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ewr6g8e","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/cp3ab3\/posts_and_comments_decrying_jeffrey_epsteins\/ewtk9co\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1574102776,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Hierarchy(You know, like the Pyramids, or the thing on the dollar bill?) appears to be inevitable, and hierarchy means a large subset of people are fucked and crushed under the weight of things. This is a fundamental aspect of all social structures(I use the term social in the most loose sense possible - \"meat robots bumping into other meat robots\")\n\nWhat is the solution if we know that lots of meat robots bumping into each other = hell on earth for the vast majority of life?\n\nThe news gets even worse. Notice that this is not simply a human problem. Herbivores suffer from hierarchy in (NSFL)[nature](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PcnH_TOqi3I?t=21), but it is not just people who suffer under human heirarchy, it is (NSFL)[highly sentient animals](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3338) as well.\n\nIs it time to admit that life is hell by nature? The winners of life are least likely to grasp that life is hell by nature, because that ignorance is a Darwinian adaptation that *makes* them winners. If they felt guilty, they *couldn't* win. Let that sink in for a second. Repeated once more: If CEO's weren't psychopaths, they *couldn't* do the sorts of horrifying things Amazon and Walmart does to the bottom rungs of its company. Again this is a problem intrinsic to **all** life on Earth because hierarchy is **inevitable** and ingrained in the laws of physics in so far as a few things exist:\n\n* Social machines(meat robots like us, cows, insects, etc)\n\n* Limited resources\n\n* Replication and variation(of said social machines-- the making of babies to repeat the cycle)\n\n* Spacetime(The 'Press play' button of the Universe which results in the constant struggle for resources and replication)\n\nIf those 4 variables exist(as they have always existed on Earth), you get a **meat grinder**, every time. Utopias cannot exist in this universe, the laws of physics forbids it. Psychopaths(wether we mean baboons who eat gazelles alive, or CEO's who \"eat workers alive\") will rule over all hierarchies. There is no such thing as a \"benevolent ruler\", only gradations of evil. The laws of physics and natural selection make it impossible for 'the good guys' to win.

This taboo belongs to the larger memeplex of 'death denial'. The idea that you will go to heaven is death denial. The selling and industry of life insurance is death denial. Transhumanism is death denial. Cryonic service subscriptions are death denial.\n\nAll of these serve the purpose: \"Stop worrying about death and be **productive**. Have children. Go to work. Serve the millitary. Win the game for our group.\"\n\nThe group which maximizes death denial, maximizes their odds of beating the other group.\n\nOn the taboo of suicide specifically, all life means profit. Why, for example, do we force the elderly to life until the absolute last moment? Why do we often force these people who have struggled to die in little more than piss, shit, pain, and confusion? Because to let them die, is quite simply, less profitable than forcing them to live. Every moment these people live, they generate something. They are vampirized by the system. They require medical coverage, which fuels medical economy. They require drugs, which fuel the medical economy. They require clothes, food, housing, etc. All of this vampirizes resources for the purpose of maximizing an economic game. If a drug painlessly ended their lives at 80 which they would have had to endure in discomfort to 95, those 15 years are lost money compared to 20-50 dollars spent on a peaceful, lethal drug.

Friends and colleagues described him to me as a quantitative genius and a scientific sophisticate, and they invited me to salons and coffee klatches at which he held court. But I found him to be a kibitzer and a dilettante \u2014 he would abruptly change the subject ADD style, dismiss an observation with an adolescent wisecrack, and privilege his own intuitions over systematic data. I think the dislike was mutual\u2014according to a friend, he \u201cvoted me off the island,\u201d presumably because he was sick of me trying to keep the conversation on track and correcting him when he shot off his mouth on topics he knew nothing about. But Epstein had insinuated himself with so many people I intersected with (Alan Dershowitz, Martin Nowak, John Brockman, Steve Kosslyn, Lawrence Krauss) and so many institutions he helped fund (Harvard\u2019s Program in Evolutionary Dynamics, ASU\u2019s Origins Project, even Harvard Hillel) that I often ended up at the same place with him. (Most of these gatherings were prior to the revelation of his sex crimes, such as the 2002 plane trip to TED with Dawkins, Dennett, the Brockmans, and others, but Krauss\u2019s Origins Project Meeting came after he served his sentence.) Since I was often the most recognizable person in the room, someone would snap a picture; some of them resurfaced this past week, circulated by people who disagree with me on various topics and apparently believe that the photos are effective arguments.\n\n&gt;  In the interests of full disclosure, there was another connection. Alan Dershowitz and I are friends and colleagues, and we taught a course together at Harvard. He often asks me questions about syntax and semantics of laws, most recently the impeachment statute. While he was representing Epstein, he asked me about the natural interpretation of one of the relevant laws, and I offered my opinion; this was cited in a court document. I did it as a favor to a friend and colleague, not as a paid expert witness, but I now regret that I did so. And needless to say I find Epstein\u2019s behavior reprehensible.\n\n&gt;  Since some of the social-media snark insinuates that I downplay sexual exploitation, it may be worth adding that I have a paper trail of abhorrence of violence against women, have celebrated efforts to stamp it out, and have tried to make my own small contribution to this effort.\n\n&gt;  My review of the history of rape and battering in The Better Angels of Our Nature begins:\n\n&gt;  \u201cRape is one of the prime atrocities in the human repertoire. It combines pain, degradation, terror, trauma, the seizure of a woman\u2019s means of perpetuating life, and an intrusion into the makeup of her progeny. It is also one of the commonest of atrocities.\u201d\n\n&gt;  The lengthy section lauds feminist writers like Susan Brownmiller who first documented the prevalence of rape and the historic indifference to it, and who called for concerted measures to eliminate it. I then refute the cynical assumption that those measures are idealistic or utopian, that nothing can be done to combat violence against women until some distant day in the future in which the patriarchy is finally dismantled or human nature changes. On the contrary, I show that this campaign has achieved considerable success: rates of sexual assault and domestic violence against women have dropped dramatically since data were first kept by Bureau of Justice Statistics, and societal tolerance has plummeted as well. (I updated the data In Enlightenment Now.) As far as I know I\u2019m the only writer who has documented and celebrated actual progress in reducing violence against women, and argued that this progress shows that the effort is not futile and should embolden us to press for greater reductions still.\n\n&gt;  Given my longstanding distaste for everything Epstein, it\u2019s galling to be publicly associated with him based on some photos and mutual associates, but I suppose this is one of the dubious perquisites of fame (by academic standards). And it\u2019s a particular hazard in the era of social media \u2014 last year I was featured in a New York Times op-ed by Jesse Singal called \u201cSocial Media Is Making Us Dumber. Here\u2019s Exhibit A\u201d; this year I appear to be Exhibit B.\n\n- Steven Pinker\n\nI have some disagreements with Pinker's books, but whatever conspiracy exists, it cannot involve *everyone*. I believe what Pinker has written here, and don't think everyone that has ever brushed shoulders with Epstein is his ally and accomplice.

Let's examine this together like we're diagnosing a device -- that's what the brain is. It learns these little tricks for surviving scary situations-- it's really good and clever at it. So your brain actually did a **good** job when it learned so well to defend itself against the real threat of your dad's verbal abuse. We can change our perspective here from negative to positive because it's far more accurate to what is going on(we want to be accurate where ever possible) and pat brain on the back.\n\nGood job brain!(It sounds silly, but it *really* helps if you say it out loud and believe it -- because it's **true**)\n\nNow, you know how some people have dogs, and they sometimes bark and go nuts when they hear someone arriving, but... it's actually just a friend? It's a little bit annoying. Maybe more than a little bit annoying sometimes, but it shouldn't ever be infuriating or shameful or saddening, right? That'd make little sense.\n\nSo in our diagnosis, it's the same thing. We can say the brain is currently malfunctioning in the same way a dog malfunctions when a friend comes by and it barks and barks. It doesn't *know* there's no danger, so we have to turn the dial down somehow. You can do this by simply trying to become as **aware** as possible in the moment where yelling is taking place. Be as aware as possible that there is *no* danger here(or nowhere near the danger the brain thinks there is). If you notice yourself getting scared, then just realize and maybe think something like: \"Huh... that's strange. I'm feeling scared but I *know* there is no reason to be scared. The brain is so *weird*!\" Try to prioritize the feeling scared versus the crying first. Forget about not crying for now, only focus on the feeling of fear\/anxiety since that's much easier to work on, not crying will follow after.\n\nJust be amazed.

I don't think it's possible for two human beings to truly be meaningful friends or lovers, because of how I view human nature(cynically and pessimistically). I think true mutual selflessness is either impossible, or so rare that it's futile to search for it. All relationships turn into some form of abusive\/co-dependent dynamic. There seems to always be this push-pull effect, where one person's needs\/will gets pushed into the other's, because we are essentially competing for resources. Conversational bandwidth. Each other's attention. Emotional need. And those are only some of the non-material aspects, let alone the material ones. \n\nI've had plenty of collisions in life where I've recognized that people who I thought were my friends, were not my friends in the sense I thought they were, and I'm sure they've experienced some form of disappointment here from me as well. Earlier in life, I had a tendency for co-dependency as a result of a long history of child\/adolescent abuse. So since I was a doormat, it was easy to walk over me. These are the dynamics that developed between me and the people I've known the longest. \n\n\nTo pick a memory as an example, I was once in the process of having my wisdom teeth removed many years ago. One of my closest friends was in a relationship at the time, and he was the only one who could pick me up from the hospital aside from my deeply mentally ill and abusive mother(They don't release you from the hospital after general anesthesia otherwise). He called at the last second to say he couldn't pick me up because his girlfriend, who he had been seeing for a few weeks, I think? ...was having some sort of panic attack, forcing me to be in a dazed, weakened and vulnerable state around the person I've spent a lot of effort minimizing contact after many years of extreme physical and psychological abuse. It was not a pleasant time.\n\nThis was one of my two absolute closest friends at the time who I'd known over 10 years since high school, who I spent a significant portion of my time with, with a \"I'd give you a kidney\" sort of relationship. His girlfriend turned out to be a complete psychopath and he broke up with her shortly, to add insult to injury. If the situation was reversed, I would drop what I was doing and help this person in a heartbeat(I tend to do this unconditionally as a person unless it's somehow deeply opposed to my values). But that was just one event of many where I had to learn over a many year period that I was suffering from an illusion. There was no apology other than an impromptu 'sorry' casually thrown into the sentence prior to me going to the hospital.\n\nMy friendships had plenty of highs as well, of course. I didn't find myself in the company of completely deranged sociopaths who made a sport out of scapegoating me so here I was lucky, but life has been full of such events that crystallized where I stood in relation to my friends. I asked myself if I would tolerate treating my friends the way they sometimes treated me if the roles were reversed, and I realized there's no way I couldn't at least be aware and profusely apologetic. There's no one to truly blame, of course. Everyone's merely a victim of human nature and the inherently abusive, zero sum nature of human relations.\n\nWhen two \"needy\" things collide, there is always a winner and loser in some sense. And this is impossible for me to ignore or tolerate the abusive dynamics of, either as the winner or the loser(Although you can guess which one is easier for you to tolerate and to ignore the problem of). I actively avoid being both the winner and the loser today, and I avoid romantic pursuits for the same reason, they are just as much a game involving who can get away with more.\n\nI've accepted loneliness as a fundamental property of being committed to honesty about human nature. The only way to be sane here is to love loneliness and realize this 'need machine' in you only harms others or asks to be harmed, in my view. Loneliness has huge benefits once you remove the negative stigma attached to it, although that's very hard to do.\n\n&gt; \u201cA man can be himself only so long as he is alone; and if he does not love solitude, he will not love freedom; for it is only when he is alone that he is really free.\u201d\n\n-- Arthur Schopenhauer","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1565831232,"distinguished":null,"edited":1565837232,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ewwo1y9","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cqhh8r","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_cqhh8r","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/cqhh8r\/has_anyone_just_sworn_off_romantic_relationships\/ewwo1y9\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1574155880,"score":11,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

But it's reasonable to assume that our aliens can provide arrangements and impose certain conditions on the happy people who are allowed to live\n\nIt's reasonable to assume *your* aliens can improve things, but not mine. In my scenario, the aliens have the answers, and we're the drooling retards who erroneously love life and all of its contrivances. What are the ethics here? To each their own? \n\n\n&gt;they should maintain a biosphere that doesn't contain any other animals possessing a nervous system, they should guarantee everyone continuous freedom of association, they can't reproduce except by cloning the conscience (thus ensuring consent), and so on. Then the only remaining source of unhappiness is internal.\n\nFreedom of association? There is no freedom. You're a slave to causality. Is there an ego here? A self which feels the subjective experience \"I\"? Only source of unhappiness is **internal**??? Does this consciousness exist in some sort of non-causal vacuum, then? I don't think you've thought the concept of 'sources of unhappiness' through. Is there any hedonic spectrum, pleasure\/pain? Entropy? If so, it's a meat grinder. The winning thing will game the system in a way that obscures their transgressions and gaslights(consciously or unconsciously) all consciousnesses in the game of the truth of their existence and their relationships to each other. I have a feeling you'll see no problem with this, or the fact that the 'lot of suffering' you acknowledge(which you certainly have failed to sit down and consider the scope and scale of in the past half a billion years) is a cost to pave the way to your self-cloning computer consciousnesses. You are also completely okay risking your own and other consciousnesses if this all goes wrong(which it already has). Could this be because you have not [tasted losing](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/IiLBH) sufficiently in the life you've been thrown into? Or perhaps your phenotype is tailored to winning in such a way that it fails to appreciate the ethics of losing, as an adaptive strategy? Let's call questions of this sort 'rhetorical a priori'. Your alien-tailored life guarantees misery(with the guarantee of greater and greater misery), and is totally unnecessary and self-masturbatory. And again, only the self-masturbatory will fail to see a problem with this, in the same sense that a blind person in a glass box will fail to see the infinite regress of [child rape](https:\/\/youtu.be\/u0cGxikOHPM?t=986) occurring in all dimensions around them, and fail to press the off switch as a result, perfectly content shooting his load on the glass walls daily.\n\n&gt; I don't find your idea that even \"happy\" people are actually deluded by their instincts convincing.\n\nThen you have not considered the phenomenology of psychopathy very carefully. You have probably not considered what being a psychopathic sadist is like, but you certainly have not considered what a perfect pill that cures it produces(and the difference between knowing you wanted the pill *after* having been given it vs. *before*). How would you describe your own phenomenology, out of curiosity? Check mark next to free will? Is it an ad hominem to tell a psychopath \"You can't *get* this concept, because your brain is damaged\"? Or does this fall under \"To each their own\" and \"Who is to say what is damaged and what isn't?\"? Do we presumably have a moral duty to let psychopaths be psychopaths under the dogma of Libertarian values?\n\n&gt;That I wouldn't believe the aliens' assertion without proof, because that's not what I believe?\n\nIt seems like the only rational way forward is for everyone to begin examining how their subjective experience differs, and understand why it differs, and to try to experience modes of subjective experience that are dramatically different and previously incomprehensible for the purpose of avoiding myopia going forward.

If I told you for the first time today, that you could raise your IQ by 0.20 points every month by staring at a wall for fifteen minutes to an hour daily, you'd be kicking yourself right now that you didn't start 10 years ago and are now 24 IQ smarter today. This is relatively how *good* meditation is, only once you understand what it does exactly. You're training the ability to be lucid and not at the mercy of the sort of thoughts you would be highly averse to if you could appreciate how much harm they do. The sort of community around these parts worries about shaving off hours of sleep, but they don't appreciate how much time is lost being completely self-absorbed, unless they meditate and train attention.\n\nSo you should start taking that very seriously, as quickly as possible.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1565871865,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ewxzs1q","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cp81az","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_cp81az","permalink":"\/r\/slatestarcodex\/comments\/cp81az\/are_there_any_good_indicators_of_a_goodbad\/ewxzs1q\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1574178562,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"slatestarcodex","subreddit_id":"t5_30m6u","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/slatestarcodex","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

You can't out-lion a pack of lions as a huge herd of antelope. You can only out-antelope it in small victories(always while taking greater losses than the lion does) These are victories of defense, not of offense. You can never win an offensive war as antelope. Likewise, the lions aren't stupid enough to kill all the antelope and lose their food source. They **need** antelope. If they wanted to, of course, they could eradicate all antelope. And they only grow stronger and stronger because the lion strategy is favored by evolution in that:\n\n* 1) It is evil. Evil how? Evil in the sense that it ignores ethics. If you ignore ethics, you have an advantage, by definition, because there is no rule you won't break to win. Being an herbivore can be seen as a 'rule'. Of course, all of this happens unconsciously. Lions don't understand they're assholes any more than antelope understand they reduce net suffering by not torturing living things by eating them alive.

It's not going out there and testing its shells strength. It has to *wait*, and therefore, it isn't evolving quickly, it doesn't respond to the feedback of success\/failure. A proactive strategy is constantly tested. Muscle fibers are strengthened. Subconsciously the brain acknowledges success and failure, and repeats what works, and avoids what doesn't, due to punishment\/reward mechanisms.

I said it's not Kosher!\" What you say is irrelevant, what *is*, is what matters, and how what you say deals with and respects 'what is'). Are better rules possible? *Obviously*. But, hmm... who dictates what the rules are? The powerful... well golly! How *convenient*. I'm guessing these are the same people who will tell you that they think suffering is an illusion and we need to maximize all forms of experience, for uh.... science? \n\nBut... what happens when we put this theory to the test, again? I don't think you entertained my previous scenario with the kitchen burner beyond \"well I'd just be suffering from an illusion\". Unfortunately you *won't* entertain it in the way I want you to, and I've already explained why.\n\nThe rest of what you wrote, barring the Free Will part which I will get to at the end of this post, is addressed by the very end of the post you responded to. I will restate that part for you:\n\n&gt;It seems like the only rational way forward is for everyone to begin examining how their subjective experience differs, and understand why it differs, and to try to experience modes of subjective experience that are dramatically different and previously incomprehensible for the purpose of avoiding myopia going forward. The stakes are just a little bit high. - \/u\/Compassionate_Cat\n\nBefore we get to Free Will, first:\n\n&gt;&gt;Also btw: I'm getting a feeling that you masturbate to pictures of people dying in gruesome ways and the like and justify it to yourself as \"research\". It's a fetish dude.\n\nInteresting! Are you really getting that feeling? If this is true, why do I abhor the 'torture porn' genre of fiction? Nothing is worse than gratuitous suffering with no point-- or a bad\/superficial point(Suffering for the sake of suffering, suffering for the sake of entertainment, etc). Am I just horribly deluding myself? Possibly, just like you could be horribly deluded here, right? This remains a real problem for your hypothesis. We'll trade our feelings of each other based on my engagements with you, at any rate:\n\n I get the feeling that you are a generic rationalist psychopath who cannot deal with the reality of suffering on this planet-- specifically, you couldn't deal with *how* you fail to deal with it. You can't bear to look upon the gravity, scope, and scale of suffering on the planet because it would expose you for what you are-- largely lacking empathy(perhaps deluding yourself that you have it, perhaps rationalizing your lack of it some other way), largely self-absorbed(You have to be, after all, to believe in free will or Libertarian politics), completely averse to *anything* which threatens your egomaniacal self-model. You will probably never touch a psychedelic drug, and if you did, the drug may not even have the right effect on you if you're unlucky. Some egos cannot be crushed, alas. You will never question the self, you clutch it dearly. Your own mortality must be ignored or rationalized or conquered, because otherwise there would be existential panic. Is there a monthly subscription to a Cryonics service going on, by any chance? You should totally get in on that if you haven't already, and while you're at it, let [this child](https:\/\/youtu.be\/m_6Y5H9ngZc?t=87) know too. You're forced to call everyone who engages with the reality of suffering on the planet as some kind of psychosexual, sadistic fetishist because it helps you make sense of why you simply can't tolerate considering what living in an utterly depraved and sadistic word *means*(And why you don't care). Or simple, conscious dishonesty, which is the ape special, after all. You're obviously a very smart guy, so there's always the minute possibility that you're not doomed.\n\nJust a hunch of mine, of course. Could be wrong-- which would bother me deeply. Nothing is worse than being wrong, ultimately(even though being tortured sure *feels* worse than being wrong), simply because being wrong opens the door to hell. This is a good segway to clear the confusion you're expressing repeatedly. If hell is being right, then that door should be the **final** door. If any other ignorance exists, an openness to move towards hell, even in the promise of being less wrong, is actually being **more** wrong. This is why the correct intellectual starting question is not \"How can we be less wrong?\" but \"How can we be less wrong in regards to moving away from hell?\" The less reality represents hell, the more reality serves as a substrate of truth, simply because *untruth* is a feature of hell(our reality exists in some proximity to hell, and we must move our reality away as the first priority. Truth comes second). EY types seem to think that first we solve how to be less wrong, *then* we solve how to not be in hell(if not being in hell matters). To be a rational cosmonaut, we must bravely be open to the idea of moving towards hell if we truly serve the ultimate virtue of less wrong, or... something? This is wrong in a way that *typifies* the \"smart people *hilariously* fail to recognize the obvious\" meme:\n\n* Doing science\/being rational in hell is **hard**! \n\nBut how can you knoooooowwwwwwwwww? What if it's easier! After all, Ashkenazi Jews(tangent: Some pretty smart ones reject free will) are generally geniuses today and they went through several hells! What if we just keep... inching... towards... it... while... it... becomes... obscured... through... [Darwinian](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv)... processes... -- It has got to be the way forward. It has **got** to be.\n\n\n\nI genuinely can't tell if you'll agree that doing science and being rational in hell is hard, but the problem remains that one of us claims we're already in hell's event horizon while the other is poised to reject this idea.

On second read 10 hours later, this appears to be a blog post arguing *for* determinism. I admit I've been primed by the idea that this blog post was a defense of Free Will, and responded to every sentence in it as an argument **for** Free Will. Want to elaborate how I'm confused, exactly? In the future it would be nice if you actually explained the points you make, rather than link LessWrong and close the case, and leave the burden on me to figure out what the hell you're talking about. If you examine the way you engage, you'll notice you have a tendency for doing this in a way that matches my psychological profile of you.\n\n**Edit**: Ah okay, the offending passage is: *\"You don\u2019t need neuroscience or physics to push naive definitions of free will into incoherence. \"* This is the source of the compatibilism. The whole thing is quite literally determinism, with the exception of this one *teensy* bit here. I hear this is a common problem, in the compatibilism\/determinism debate, so I have absolutely no idea how I'm terribly *misguided*, as you claim. The thing you and EY call freedom is not freedom. The fact that the mind has to be embodied in something does not give you freedom, and I tackle this in the last few quoted passages of the text. I was genuinely concerned for a few minutes there that I had made a complete idiot of myself by completely believing you about this blog post actually opposing my position, it turns out it *does* after all because it tries to maintain that freedom is coherent in an utterly sneaky and obscurantist way. \n\nA syllogism may be appropriate, but I ultimately do not believe philosophical approaches solve this problem as you will discover if you read on. Regardless:\n\nTerms: 'Meaningfully choose': To meaningfully choose something means one could have chosen otherwise WRT each specific instance of choice.\n\nP1:If you are conscious, then you are a script where no part of you is written *without* prior causal implications you did not meaningfully choose.\n\nP2:If you are a script where no part of you is written without prior causal implications you did not meaningfully choose, then you are not free.\n\nC: You are not free.\n\nOriginal post below:\n\n So-- I'm not going to take a hammer to EY's entire matryoshka on Free Will because that would take a lot of energy on my part, but I will skim over just the page you linked and mention a couple snippets I see as relevent. First, the problem of Free Will: The arguments for Free Will are done to death, and the only problem that stands in the way of solving it is phenomenology. You could rationalize and debate and blog on free will for another thousand years and you will **never** solve Free Will this way alone. You **must** take a cogsci approach and show how people *differ* in their phenomenology. Science must solve free will, **not** philosophy. One group of people are suffering from an illusion, that we can be most certain of here, yes? Some group is confused about free will. So start understanding the different brains and psychologies of these groups. Arguing for or against free will won't work well. Ask instead which group could be suffering from the illusion? Why? What about the way they **are**(which they did not choose), **determines**(bolded to be your hint) this illusion? You will never stop asking this question if you really care about being less wrong.\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/6u8gyFR.png\n\nThis is revealing in regards to EY's psychology. He's not just saying this is what people do. He's imagining *how* people are confused about free will by imagining how **he** would be confused about free will. Here, he has already failed, because he hasn't asked: \"Can I be confused as a result of my phenomenology?\" Or acknowledges the question, but simultaneously acknowledges it as uninteresting or useless.\n\n&gt;Likewise that old chestnut, \u201cReductionism undermines rationality itself. Because then, every time you said something, it wouldn\u2019t be the result of reasoning about the evidence\u2014it would be merely quarks bopping around.\u201d\n\nIt doesn't undermine it at all. It *is* quarks bopping around(or whatever causal thing you want to plug in-- Brain in a vat, Christian souls, hard determinisim, quantum randomness, chaos), it's simply the case that you being free to rationalize it is completely incoherent. You're rationalizing all the time, and that rationalizing is less or more rational(by sheer happenstance). But you're sure as hell not **free** to do any of it.\n\n&gt; there are many levels of organization that separate our models of our thoughts\u2014our emotions, our beliefs, our agonizing indecisions, and our final choices\u2014from our models of electrons and quarks.\n\nIt doesn't matter how many levels of organization there are in regards to free will. What matters in regards to free will is that causation determines the upper levels of organization. It doesn't matter if everything is a quantum, non-deterministic substrate, because everything that it gives rise to **is** explicitly deterministic. Including your next movement, thought, who you are, where you were born, what your philosophy is, whether you will respond to this post or not, whether you will lie to yourself or not, etc. Freedom is **incoherent** in light of this information. Flail your arms all you want to prove you're free, you're not doing it freely, a script is being executed, and you're watching all while having a sensation that you're not *just* watching, but *participating*. If you lack the phenomenology to see that you're not really participating, no amount of argument will help you. Someone is right and someone is wrong, start doing science and stop doing philosophy.\n\n&gt;We can intuitively visualize that a hand is made of fingers (and thumb and palm). To ask whether it\u2019s really our hand that picks something up, or merely our fingers, thumb, and palm, is transparently a wrong question.\n\nI don't have anything of substance to contribute here, I just wish we were both smeared across spacetime in a less technologically impoverished position, so we could connect our neuralinks and both see how hilariously confused *about* confusion EY is with those two sentences. We could even get closer to solving our hunches about each other in the same move-- two birds.\n\n&gt;And so it requires constant vigilance to maintain your perception of yourself as an entity within physics.\n\nConceptually close in format, but so far-- exactly the **opposite**: \n\n* It takes a constant failure of awareness to maintain your perception of yourself as an entity separate from physics. \n\nAgain, it's patently obvious to someone who once had this failure of awareness and would buy this argument, exactly how this argument is wrong. But again, this is the burden of esoteric knowledge. You just can't know until you experience. You can tell someone how to experience, thankfully-- so it's scientifically as sound as any other concept. This isn't a \"God whispered in my ear, and if he didn't whisper in yours, all I can do is re-affirm that you should have faith\" problem. \n\n&gt;But if the laws of physics control us, then how can we be said to control ourselves?\n\nThe question is evaded by being rhetorical, and EY puts the rabbit into the hat with:\n\n&gt;If the laws of physics did not control us, how could we possibly control ourselves?\n\nThe answer is, there is no coherent way we can control a **single** thing in **both** scenarios. But again, the fantasy has powerful adaptive value, so like Religion, and all self-deception, it will live on and shape reality with it's will to power.\n\n&gt;How could thoughts judge other thoughts\n\nEffortlessly. Just not freely.\n\n&gt; how could emotions conflict with each other\n\nEffortlessly. Just not freely.\n\n&gt; how could one course of action appear best\n\nEffortlessly. Just not freely.\n\n&gt; how could we pass from uncertainty to certainty about our own plans, in the midst of utter chaos?\n\nIn the midst of *utter* chaos? We couldn't. \"We are lost in chaos, **therefore** we must be free in order!\" is the non-sequitur EY makes here if you need it spelled out. \n\n\nReality: We are slaves in chaos, we are slaves in order.

It involves a concept in game theory called the prisoner's dilemma. First scrap your understanding of the entire globe and re-frame the problem with only 3 superpowers: SP1, SP2, SP3. Earth is still earth, so they're all competing for resources. They're all inching closer to annex each other's lands. They're all playing the 'toy soldiers' game, creeping closer and posturing for strategic dominance of each other. If one gets too big, the other two gang up, and then the big one tries to game the other two to backstab the other, or some such strategy. At the same time, they're playing a game of superficially friendly economics, which too is another kind of war. When two of these superpowers cooperate to trade or exchange resources(information, natural resources, etc), they want to pretend to be someone's friend in so far as you get more out of the friendship than they do. It sounds mean and horrible, but if you don't do this, the other one will. If you don't build the nukes, the other one will. If you don't exploit your people, the other one will. Everything that is unethical in the world is done because of this core problem where [perfectly exploiting](https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/613585\/prisoners-dilemma-shows-how-exploitation-is-a-basic-property-of-human-society\/) a game where you're also cooperating(pretending to, that is), is the way to 'win'. \n\nThere's this lie being circulated these days that cooperation is the best strategy in the prisoner's dilemma, but ultimately this isn't the case. This is extremely intuitive based on what we know about how natural selection(the rules that govern our reality) works. That which is the most skilled thing at winning(fittest), **wins the game**. Notice how this has nothing to do with being the most ethical thing? Again, pause and take a look at our world and look at who the winners are for a second. Makes sense yet? The game being played here is \"Win at all costs\". The winners are playing *that* game, whether you are or not. They are playing this way because they quite literally have to, or they will be destroyed. And to beat these people, you have to become a monster, just like them. You literally cannot win an 'anything goes' game without being the biggest monster on the field, because otherwise, there will be someone *just* as skilled as you but willing to cheat more than you are, and better at getting away with it. And that's who will beat you according to natural selection.\n\nOf course, if your question was purely ethical, it's not justified. Ethically, the geopolitical chess game is a horror show because everyone loses. Everyone is subjected to nuclear fallout to some degree, destructive technology, terrorist blowback, dangerous chemicals, brainwashing campaigns, the destruction of the environment for strategic gains(You think Russia, the U.S. and China are all equally too stupid to realize they're raping the planet by using gas-powered cars?

So we know that we exist in some substrate giving rise to all of *this*. That substrate could be the quantum wavefunction, it could be hard determinism, it could be a brain in vat, it could be a Christian soul, ad infinitum. No matter *what* it is, what emerges from that substrate is **unambiguously causal determinism**. The world where consciousness exists is determined even if non-deterministic(quantum or otherwise) events give rise to this determinism. At our level, it's *simply* billiard ball physics, even if those billiard balls came out of something non-billiard bally. \n\nIf quantum events are non-deterministic, they still give rise to upper layers that *are* purely deterministic. And whatever \"will\" there is, doesn't exist on the quantum level, because in so far as we know, *consciousness* doesn't exist there. Even if it did, it would need to be *non-causal* to be free.

If you look carefully, there is not a single element of your will that can be called \"detached from causality\", which is what it would need to be, to be free. There is no point where you can step in say, \"Ah hah! **Here** is where I am free!\" simply because the causal variables *prior* to that state you're pointing to are **causing** the state you call \"Free\". Whether that causality is determined, random, or probabilistic, is irrelevent-- it's simply **causal**, and it is crucial that you aren't the causer. You're simply the product of such causes, down from your neurons, to hand motions, to daily routine, to breathing, to eye movements, to neurons fired, to thoughts experienced, to decisions made.\n\nNon-deterministic substrates(Like Quantum wavefunction) do not give you any room for freedom, because your will is not expressed at a quantum level where you're the electron going left *or* right. Even if the electron was conscious, it too would be subject to some sort of causality(random, deterministic, meta-quantum, doesn't matter).

We have to start by realizing **someone** is suffering from the illusion. Who is it? Which branch of knowledge solves this problem definitively? I suspect the answer lies in the sort of work Jon Haidt has done with respect to political perferences and personality. The outline of that is that being low in the personality trait \"openness to experience\" correlate with conservative politics, while people high in openness to experience correlate with liberal politics. Liberals speak for the weak and oppressed; want change and justice, even at risk of chaos, while conservatives speak for institutions and traditions; want order even at the cost to those at the bottom.\n\nThe brains of these people **determine** their representation of reality. The same is true for Free Will. What does someone have to lose by rejecting free will? It will have to be rooted in psychology. Certain phenomenologies are completely incoherent without a belief that one is freely engaging with the world. Narcissists who feel deeply entitled, for example, can't reject free will because you can't *deserve* something if there is no free will. A billionaire who pats himself on the back because he inherited a trust fund and bought a second yacht doesn't say, \"Whelp, no free will. What a perverse world where I win the dice roll that someone loses...\" as they blare the fog horn on said yacht.

We can examine who the winners of history were, and if they too had such narratives operating. \"The apocalypse is coming\" is an ancient idea that we constantly see appear again and again, but no one learns from history. The real thing to be afraid of is the idea that the apocalypse is *not* coming...\n\nWho will win? The good guys? As you are told in just about every single fictional story you've consumed since childhood? Every Disney film to every Marvel film to every Game of Thrones\/Stranger Things episode? Who benefits from the narrative: Good conquers Evil, despite heavy losses at times?\n\nThe thing which paints itself as Good benefits. The thing which wins the game in any given era benefits, because everyone believes the [camouflage](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv), and then this winner re-writes history after it wins said era. Then the next \"Good\" thing comes along, like heroes, and slays the evil dragon and overthrows the evil king. Finally, progress! \n\nBut... of course, this isn't progress, just the illusion of it. Bones are then thrown to the dogs in the form of things like iPhones and the internet, and people think the good guys won, but the good guys didn't win-- the thing best camouflaged as good, while doing everything evil necessary to win, won. You don't get your smartphone because you're sticking it to the man. You get your smartphone because you sitting around on your smartphone benefits the man **more** than it benefits you. If all the rulers of the world and their servants were *losing* dominion over their kingdom as a result of smartphone use, smartphones would be stamped down and destroyed. All progress is in the form of a bone thrown to dogs who have more utility to master than they cost to be destroyed or ignored. Just imagine if the entire world perceived you to be the number 1 threat to every nation's national security for some strange reason, real or fictional. Close your eyes for a full minute and try to visualize what that would look like. The belief that is operative is: Your **existence** is the utmost threat to everyone's security. Again, it does not matter if this is true or not. What would happen? You already know what would happen. Your death would be prompt, and everyone would mourn your \"suicide\". Or you would vanish.

Maybe you did, since all physical and conceptual spaces in this universe are some form of echo chamber that considers a degree of deviation from its dogmatic narrative to be heresy. Let's examine your first efforts at a point:\n\n&gt;[you believe] proles have little hope under the current material conditions to free themselves from the yoke of capital.\n\nFirst ask yourself if you've actually given a representation of my view that even *I* can't disagree with? This idea is called Steelmanning, an exercise in intellectual honesty-- something which you should forgive me to think you couldn't even do if someone put a gun to your head. Anyway, to waste no more time, you've failed utterly to represent what I believe. You haven't given some big punchline to what I'm saying, because Capitalism isn't even a big picture problem as far as I see things. Our foot hurts because we can't stop kicking people because of a brain tumor, and we've diagnosed the problem to be the foot, and are trying to amputate it. We don't understand that we actually have a brain tumor-- It's us, not our foot. You think your foot is evil, but you exist in a universe where brains degrade and tumors metastasize. If the only thing in the universe was a hammer and all you saw was hammer violence since humans are complete psychopaths, most people out there would think hammers are evil and all problems are solved once we stop the hammers that result in killing, when in reality, if we simply didn't have a brain tumor, we'd be using the hammer to build things. We cannot imagine a hammer being anything other than evil because you're not good at diagnosis. You cannot imagine a foot being anything other than evil. **Because everyone on Earth, has a brain tumor**. The problems of those of us who ally with the political left:\n\n* Poverty\n* Drudgery\n* The full range of exploitation\n* The full range of inequality\n* Oppressor - Oppressed dynamics\n* Power\n\nAre not solved *merely* by \"escaping the 'yoke of capitalism', nor is doing so a stepping stone to progress, because progress is a fictional story that the powerful tell the powerless to make them complicit in the domination game of reality. You can intuit this effortlessly by closing your eyes and pretending to wake up in a world where Capitalism has been *wiped* from the face of the Earth. If you see a Utopia in front of you, I don't know what words someone can tell you to wake you up. The problem is people, not tools. People, not systems. People, not politics. The computer, not the software. The computer is broken, it exists on an entropic gradient which guarantees further and further breakage. It creates myths that hammer in the fairytale: \"It gets better\", \"The good guy wins\", this entraps you into constantly repeating the cycle and playing the game and being confused about what you're seeing. You are a cow who believes they [just need to eradicate stun guns](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3315) and evil goes away. If you eradicate stun guns, evil gets *further* instantiated because at least before, you could **know** what evil looked like because it was **holding a fucking stun gun and murdering you and your kind with it**. This idea is best expressed by Slavoj Zizek in his critique of how the tyrant(boss at work, or father, in this case) wields postmodernism with impunity to [exploit the weak(working class\/children\/etc)](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5dNbWGaaxWM). These sorts of ideological honeypots exist everywhere. If you think I'm trying to say \"you can't beat Capitalism\", you are *hilariously* confused about what I'm trying to say. And if it is this clear that you are hilariously confused, how *embarrassing* is it that it has taken you *this* long to expose your ignorance because you were too busy tripping over your own ego?","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1566014149,"distinguished":null,"edited":1566373778,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ex502dq","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cqwpf0","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_ex3b8u2","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/cqwpf0\/the_answer_to_burn_out_at_work_isnt_selfcareits\/ex502dq\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1574300247,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

I think facts about morality are as objective as mathematical statements like '2+2=4'. I think ethics is largely a confused game of semantics, where de-ontologists fail to understand how they are really consequentialists, and consequentialists fail to understand how they are really de-ontologists, and so on.\n\nIt you're a moral nihilist or moral anti-realist, you are essentially being too uncharitable with the problems we face when the lights turn on and we need to make sense of reality. If the lights turn on, the only truly obsessive compulsive commitment-to-**only**-what-is-**certainly**-true position is solipsism. We have no evidence that 2+2=4, we have no evidence that anyone or anything else is real, all we have evidence for is that *the lights are on and something is happening*. **Everything** else could be an illusion. The fact that the lights are on and we're experiencing the lights are on is the only self-affirming fact in the universe. This does not include \"I think therefore I am\". This is \"The lights are on therefore something **is** going on.\" There is nothing more true than this fact, not even 2+2=4. This is an extension of the confusion with moral anti-realists\/nihilists, who are simply \"Solipsists+\". Some claim we have a *little* more to say about reality than solipsists but they simply refuse to boot strap themselves and say \"2+2=4 even if there are no minds to perform the equation\". \n\nThey refuse to admit(or simply fail to understand) that all information is a conceptual framework, that is true, is real, is already written out and is infinite. Just think about any basic fact. \"Washing hands with soap and water reduces the spread of bacteria\". This statement is true, even in 200,000,000 B.C. Had what could be called 'hands' evolved yet? I can't be bothered to open another tab and check, but it is irrelevant to the statement. Soap certainly hadn't been invented. But it remains true that washing hands with soap reduces the spread of germs. If the laws of physics magically materialized disembodied hands containing germs somewhere in 200,000,00 B.C., and magically materialized soap as a result of a series of quantum oddities, and began washing hands in a river, these hands would contain less germs post-washing. This truth breaks down into various truth-algorithms, like \"but what if there was a strain of bacteria that was immune to being removed by soap due to its physical structure?\" This too would be a truth, incorporated in the algorithm, and would explain what is actually happening in reality.\n\nPeople who find this unintuitive, probably suffer from an impoverished understanding of the physics of time. They see time as flowing, constantly being built upon, like little blocks or a flowing river they're riding on, where the future isn't determined yet. Where the past already happened, and is over. This is not how time works. The flow of time is a hallucination in our brains because that's simply the relativistic constraints under how we *happened* to evolve. The future is determined, like an algorithm that has been written. You are subjectively feeling like you are traveling through this algorithm. Likewise, all conceptual information, all of mathematics, is already 'written' in conceptual space. All of ethics exists as a concept, too, including every right and wrong ethical move in every possible situation, both actual and potential. Whatever is true about suffering and happiness and torture is maximized, whether it happens in this universe or not. It is a concept that is *waiting* to be discovered by subjects like ourselves. *Will* it be discovered? That is another question. Whatever we call \"human\" certainly won't even scratch the surface of the total sum of information that exists, but anything that can be called \"logical\" or \"factual\" or \"possible\" or \"wrong\" **already exists** in conceptual space, just like 2+2=4 was a fact 3 billion years ago. Facts do not magically pop into existence. The truth doesn't magically stop\/start\/stop being true. Facts are eternal, and only dependent on context in so far as making them eternally true. Fact: \"Hand washing prevents germs.\" Reponse: \"Wha... what? What's a hand and what's a germ?\" Fact: \"A hand is an appendage with fingers-- soap is a fat-based cleansing product\" and so on, and so on...\n\nHow does this apply to Antinatalism? The consequences of bringing a child into existence appear to be bad, based on the fact that the universe is a bad place, where things break down over time rather than getting better, and where good people have bad things happen more often than bad people have bad things happen. This is a result of an evolutionary quirk, where being bad, was an advantageous strategy, because it allowed for cheating in social systems. As one got better and better at being bad, they got more and more rewarded by getting better and better mates. As they got worse and worse, they got bigger and bigger(due to rewards). As they got bigger and bigger, they conquered things which were not willing or not able to be as bad as they are-- since they were skillful cheaters, they could trick good things and then kill them in their sleep, or outright overpower them, or subvert their culture, etc. Anything goes, if you're bad. Our world is shaped by the most evil possible thing, and it distills evil, as a result of the second law of thermodynamics and evolution by natural selection. Conclusion: The universe has inherently evil conditions in so far as evil is possible, and self-replicating systems competing for resources can only crystallize and distill evil as one moves farther and farther through spacetime. Conclusion: The universe is evil, Earth is evil(And getting more evil), and therefore, since subjecting beings to evil conditions is morally wrong, creating things in an evil place is a confused and unethical move. One should not bring anything into existence in this universe.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1566096166,"distinguished":null,"edited":1566096394,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"ex9y8u3","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_crscl5","locked":false,"no_follow":false,"parent_id":"t3_crscl5","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/crscl5\/are_you_a_moral_realist_or_subjectivist_how_do\/ex9y8u3\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1574385659,"score":8,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

If that's a language game someone wishes to play, they can be my guest. I don't personally find it useful. If one wants to pretend that \"Humans don't like fire + face\" is merely a subjective truth with no real meaning, then be my guest here too, but in objective reality( the place where 2+2=4), \"Humans don't like fire+face\" *is* an objective fact(Strangely, other species share this truth about reality... odd pattern-- and a species that *loved* fire+face would not pose a problem for this truth), because there are in fact, **two** ways to describe subjectivity: In subjective terms, and in objective terms. Unless of course, one subscribes to the most egomaniacal philosophical approach to reality that is possible-- solipsism, or some variant as I attempted to describe(anti-realism, moral nihilism) in which one pretends that *other* subjects are fabrications and not objective, and fails to extrapolate that one *too* must be an objective property to *other* subjects. Insofar as we understand that the descriptions of morality involve pointless suffering being bad, and fire+face can result in pointless suffering, we have an objective basis for morality.\n\n&gt; It is my opinion that it is wrong to create a sentient being and risk horrible things happening to it without its consent. But I cannot claim that this is an objective fact.\n\nThe reductio of this is that if a sadist kidnaps you and holds you hostage in their basement, binds you, and tortures your hands and feet with a blowtorch while keeping you alive for as long as possible, the best you can tell them in regards to not torture you is: \"Who am I to say this scenario is *truly* wrong... that's just like... my opinion, man.\"\n\n*gets sadistically tortured*\n\nThe technical term for this should be \"Postmodernist psychosis\"\n\nThe same is true for all torture. The same is true for a googolplex of beings being maximally tortured. The same is true for an infinity of highly sentient beings being tortured for infinity, to the greatest extent of pain the laws of physics allow. A good litmus test for whether one's ethics fail hilariously is when they fail to say an infinity of beings in an infinity of infinite hells is *really* wrong. If there is anything in the universe that is truly wrong for all things that can possibly be perceived of in moral terms, it is this. Start there as a first premise and work up.

Why isn't it just completely obvious that scientific theories aim at empirical adequacy, not truth? What reasonable defense could you offer for a statement of the form, \u201cTheory X is true,\u201d beyond the observation that Theory X passes one empirical test after another? Pigliucci's parenthetical about the limits of human epistemic access to reality is pretty important. What access do we have to reality beyond determining what works and what doesn't?\n\n=\n\n&gt;Essentially, what I'm disagreeing with is your assertion that happiness must track with reality in order to be valid.\n\nExcept that isn't my assertion. You're putting so much weight into subjectivity because you think that's all there could possibly be. I never used the word \"valid\", this word almost makes subjectivity seem justified. Of course it's \"valid\", it's just not *meaningful*. It's not what you would want, if you could know the full suite of information. This is what we mean when we use the word \"objective\". Truths that transcend subjectivity at any given moment.\n\nAre you living a lie somehow *right* now? Who knows. Perhaps evil, manipulative aliens have implanted a device in your brain that subverts every single thing you would *otherwise* do and think, into something you'd *never* want to do if you could do what served your interests instead. If this device also makes you happy, could it be said you're meaningfully happy? Of course not, that would be absurd. You'd be *superficially* happy. Happy in a cheap sense. In a way that *you* would find repulsive if you could simply appreciate the objective circumstances. 1) The aliens **outside** of your awareness. Objective. 2) The device, sitting *inside* the subject, yet **separate** from the subject. Foreign. Intruding. Objective.\n\nIf someone had rescued you, extracted the device, and said, \"Phew, \/u\/Frost_Ravenstorm, I did it. I saved you from the alien plot. They were just *using* you and you failed to appreciate all the things you now appreciate about reality.\" You wouldn't say \"What the hell man! I was happy in there!\" unless you are completely delusional about what coming to terms with an experience like getting mindfucked and becoming a thrall to evil aliens actually means. To say some anti-realist nonsense after this fact would be to double down in the most intellectually dishonest way possible. Just imagine it.\n\n\"Who is to say what is 'evil', really? The fact that the aliens did not ask me for my consent, is merely a construct of my preferences.. it's not *bad* in any real sense.\" \n\nThis is akin to having your face *in* the hot stove, and while simultaneously screaming in agony, double down:\n\n\"This is merely a subjective preference of things which don't like pain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nIt's just such a patently absurd attempt to subvert the truth. I get it, Anti-realism is largely a post-modern concept now, meant to weaponize the meme of \"there is no truth\" to fight totalitarian tyranny.

I'm taking the axiom that there is no such distinction between meaningful and superficial happiness. That the only important thing is reducing suffering, \n\nYou would have to deny meaning wholesale to do that, because the meaning being perceived by the subject is no different from the meaning contained in objective conceptual frameworks like numbers. Anti-realists cannot get over this one crucial thing, because they imagine a universe where there can *only* be subjects, and the only things which engage in truth propositions, therefore if you simply *delete* all subjects, you are left with no truth. Therefore truth must be illusory. The specific thing they fail to understand is, subjects **are** objects. You are an object in relation to truth, from a hypotehetical God's eye view. Anti-realists however, are stuck in an egomaniacal solipsistic fantasy, so they struggle to intuit that every subject is in fact an object from a God's eye view, and there are truths and falsities relating to the universe, which algorithmically describe **all there is**. Information is infinite, and informative coalesces into an algorithm to create patterns, and these patterns are either true, or false. They are forced to reject all mathematics as meaningless and not true. They are forced to double down on claims like \"The sentence 'I am conscious' is just as meaningless and lacking in truth as the sentence 'glekrj gkj pnfm'.\"\n\nThe reductio ad absurdum to this philosophy of pure egocentric hedonism you're proposing is again, it ignores things that actually have value outside of any given subject. You have not thought this through very hard, but rather, seem to have seen a youtube video that tried to argue that Cypher eating the steak was somehow a logical or ethical move.\n\nSome scenarios with value beyond superficial hedonism:\n\n* Projects that pursue truth and an understanding of reality, like science and philosophy(You know, that thing you'd need to perform in order to entertain the question and grasp if what you're talking about right now is gibberish or not?), are lost when you're on a morphine drip from birth. It turns out, science and philosophy are *pretty* hard to do when blissed out. And science and philosophy are the only things which can save them from their moronic, solipsistic, egomaniacal fantasy.\n\n* Responsibilities, maintaining your environment so you don't ruin things for yourself and everyone else. Morphine drips don't fix climate change. To quote Chomsky here, when asked if ignorance was bliss, he replied: \"For a short time.\" Pure hedonism ignores the entropy gradient, and the reality that you actually have to be aware of reality and be happy about *reality*, not a hallucination, for it to matter. Being blissed out in the Matrix while aliens inseminate your orifices with as many fertilized eggs that can fit, and use you as incubators to warm their brood so their psychopathic species can populate the entire universe and torture it, is bad. You kind of don't want to be plugged into the Matrix to avoid this.\n\n* Any children you may have, or innocent sentient beings around you are actually capable of suffering. Another reductio to your argument is having your child, family member, friend, anyone really, raped before you on a morphine drip and being powerless to do anything because you're blissed out, is somehow fine and dandy because you can't know better?\n\nThe comic you linked doesn't put forward any kind of argument in favor of being blissed out, it just asks the question if being plugged into an experience machine is preferable to a harsh reality, and asks if it's ethical to put bad guys in an experience machine(In so far as it prevents them from doing bad things, sure. This is a far better answer than the modern prison system). The \"you have to be consistent\" argument it poses is de-ontological nonsense. You don't have to be consistent, you just need to make sense.\n\n&gt;The fact that I wasn't asked consent wasn't a problem, because the aliens weren't doing anything wrong - in fact, they were doing right! I was happy!\n\nAnother reductio: According to this, drugging a woman with fentanyl\/MDMA\/Ketamine and then raping her, is not wrong. This would even be *two* birds with one stone to you. The rapist is happy because he raped someone which raised his subjective hedonism, and the woman, who, by the way, doesn't need consent according to you to be drugged into bliss, is also 'happy' even if she would go into a vomitting fit and possibly need more drugs if she wasn't able to cope with the horror, if she had ever discovered what happened in reality outside of her own subjective experience. \n\nThere are plenty of scenarios and reasons for why being delusional, even if happy, is bad. I have to ask, have you ever had any meaningful contact with a drug addict before? I'm going to take a stab in the dark and say no. Simply notice the trend of how totally detached from consequences and things that can matter this 'morality' you're proposing is, by being so deeply committed to egomaniacal solipsism. You seem to half-heartedly believe that you're *already* plugged into some false reality where only you are real, justifying a belief *this* confused. Lastly, why are you currently not committing to your own ideas by taking opiates recreationally? What is your rationalization for why you are *not* a drug addict today? I don't even need to ask you if you're addicted to opiates because I know the message you're conveying is so patently bogus that the odds of you applying it to your own life are exactly zero, therefore you must have some sort of rationalization for why you aren't practicing it.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1566176420,"distinguished":null,"edited":1566176631,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"exdh064","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cropbn","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_exc5s7p","permalink":"\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/cropbn\/worth_sharing_every_time\/exdh064\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575077527,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

The point is not to tell you some narrative about what rape is or isn't, but rather to tell you that if you ever feel overly worried or anxious about what happened, it is not only unhelpful for you, but also don't make any sense. It's like blaming an Eskimo when they get stung by a scorpion. It just makes no sense. There's no reason for an Eskimo to know what a scorpion is. Likewise, a scorpion is just a confused thing. It's running on an operating system that says \"Run around and sting things\". It does not have the brain of someone who can think \"Hmmm... maybe I *shouldn't* sting this Eskimo? That wouldn't be very nice...\" Note: Scorpions are still fucking dangerous, and need to be avoided unless you have some kind of training\/expertise in handling them and understand the risks.\n\nIt's important for you, especially as a victim of abuse prior to this case in regards to your low self-esteem, to *understand* what abuse is. You *don't* want to be abused in the future if you can help it in light of this new information. Lack of consent-&gt;action taken=ranges from highly suspicious to clear assault. Action taken-&gt;NO expressed-&gt;Action done anyway=ranges from extreme red flag to extreme assault. Just remember if you find yourself spiraling into worry and guilt and shame etc,... these feelings don't actually make sense, since you couldn't have possibly known then what you know now.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1566181505,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"exdnlrk","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_csahx5","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_csahx5","permalink":"\/r\/suicidology\/comments\/csahx5\/tw_was_i_sexually_assaulted\/exdnlrk\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575080656,"score":1,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"suicidology","subreddit_id":"t5_2shhl","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/suicidology","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Being trapped in this neurosis is in no way our fault, but once we're aware that we can examine deeper, we can try to ask the more obvious question:\n\nWhat are we looking to get sedated and feel relief *from*?\n\nWhen you answer *that* question, and try to solve it, the first problem slowly goes away naturally. \n\nThis sounds easy and in some sense it is, but at the same time it appears extremely difficult when we're looking at the neurosis-- the feedback loop of thinking. *This* is what prevents us from asking that crucial, obvious question. So the first step is to just to sit back, take a few deep breaths so you can break the cycle of those thoughts a tiny bit, to give yourself room to ask the crucial questions: What are we looking to get sedated *from* exactly? Where is this thing? What caused this thing? What triggers it? We just need to be *totally* honest and *totally* inquisitive, like a child that constantly asks \"... but why?\" with zero emotional attachment. Children don't have these conditioned anger\/hate\/sadness\/anxiety responses usually which adults with lifetimes of trauma do, so they are genuinely expressing pure curiosity. You have to channel exactly this to discover the problem. Forget what you *think* you know and forget what you think you *should* be feeling, and just ask \"But why? Where? How?\" like a child does and don't stop doing this.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1566292897,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"exh5wfs","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cst3or","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_cst3or","permalink":"\/r\/BPD\/comments\/cst3or\/i_cant_stand_being_sober\/exh5wfs\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575140578,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"BPD","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdp","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/BPD","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

This is what happens when you play a game where some players are playing \"Anything goes\". Everyone is forced to create a maximally psychopathic culture, who puts on a facade in the front: \n\n\"We are a just, civilized nation. Progress is constantly happening. Things only improve. Work hard, to continue this improvement. Our military and police are agents of law and order and justice. Do not disobey, or you will cause problems for this just, civilized nation.\"\n\nmeanwhile... behind the scenes... another story is playing out, where the goal is perfectly distilling the ideally dissociated, slave class, managing the suicide rate with various chemical and propagandistic methods and child abuse methods, and perfecting the psychopathic torturer hierarchy which will lead the nation to victory versus the other psychopathic powers. You are free to plug this idea into *any* superpower, and you will get an accurate picture of reality. If you are a superpower and are **not** playing this game, the psychopaths in the superpower next door **will tear your shit apart**, or better -- they will **enslave** you to be their milk cows while you are powerless forever. This is the dark truth. It's not good vs. evil like some Disney, Marvel, or Game of Thrones propaganda. It's Evil vs. Evil. Homo sapiens is a de facto evil species, because we are **forced** to be, or we **die**, due to the *other* ones who will be happy to do some evil just to win. This is called the Prisoner's dilemma. Progress(real progress, not the illusion of progress which comes at the price of evil becoming more and more hidden, and more and more powerful) is **impossible** because of two conditions in the universe:\n\n1) Natural selection means the *strongest*, *best* strategy wins. This means the evilest, because evil has only one rule: Win. There's this fantasy that some people have that goes, \"Okay I just need to be willing to be the most evil guy possible, because once I win.... then we can usher in the utopia\". But this is the fantasy of an egomaniacal psychopath tyrant. The only way to win this way, is to beat all the *other* egomaniac psychopath tyrants. Which means you **become** that thing, and good becomes **impossible** because you forever dominate everything since your thirst for power knows no bounds. Your ego is a fucking black hole, it devours **everything** with it's gravitational force. Which brings us to condition 2...\n\n2) The second law of thermodynamics. Simply put, this means \"things move from order -&gt; disorder\". Things get \"noisier\" and more \"chaotic\". If you return to idea 1), you understand that evil wins naturally. Well this is the rule that says once evil wins, evil wins **forever**. Good cannot win. Why? Because once evil has a hold, it can just ruin things for good with low effort, while furthering it's own advantages, which good will struggle to fix because entropy is **helping** evil, while it hurts good. It is easier to break something than fix it.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1566297974,"distinguished":null,"edited":false,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"exh9pei","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_csuu29","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_csuu29","permalink":"\/r\/Bad_Cop_No_Donut\/comments\/csuu29\/06262019_hong_kong_police_tortured_a_62yearold\/exh9pei\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575142381,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Bad_Cop_No_Donut","subreddit_id":"t5_2qqdb","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Bad_Cop_No_Donut","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Just people will be just, and those who aren't won't be.\n\nI could respond with, \"It does not follow that because some people will be ethical and others won't, that ethics has no meaning. For there to be truths in ethics does not require complete compliance. It's even possible for an entire universe of ethically confused beings, and this would not pose a problem for the idea that there are right and wrong ways to act ethically.\"\n\n People tend to respond to ideas in various ways, depending on variables like personality traits(openness to experience, agreeableness), etc. One can either accept things blindly(high openness\/high agreeableness), reject things adamantly(low openness\/low agreeableness), or anything in between. It's this process that determines if an idea is *even entertained* to be true. You can't seriously entertain an idea, if you don't accept it first. This \"not accepting first\" is how many people react when encountering new ideas-- if it already fits the current model = accepted. If it does not fit the current model = rejected, adjusting for various biases and quirks.\n\nYou can read the thing I wrote, and literally reject it in real time, without considering it. This would be low-openness and\/or low agreeableness. There is no one correct strategy, both are important. I think the best strategy to be closest to reality is, first be open fully and ready to agree fully, then be prepared to be closed fully, or disagree fully, if the idea turns out to be genuinely disagreeable. The reason why we should take being right seriously is simply that no one wants to be wrong. No one plainly asserts they are wrong and will remain wrong for no reason-- the problem is that the subjective experience of being wrong, does not *feel* wrong. It feels right or ambiguous.

I don't think compassion for a narcissist necessitates making yourself vulnerable in any way. Empathy, on the other hand, is extremely dangerous. To me, having compassion for a narcissist is like having compassion for a bull shark. You cannot make friends with a bull shark. They are dangerous to people. You can't have empathy for a bull shark, because if you did, you would *feel* what the bull shark is supposed to feel: Which is you as food.\n\nI see the narcissist who deeply abused me for so many years this way-- like a dangerous animal, whose brain **can't** know better(trust me, I've tried). Once I deeply hated and resented them and it ate up so much of my emotional and mental energy -- this, I think, is deeply unhealthy, but completely understandable, because hatred and resentment are important coping mechanisms we developed so we could defend ourselves against extreme dangers, like narcissists and bull sharks. If a bull shark encounter resulted in a trauma, we could even hate a bull shark. We could say \"I *loathe* that shark that injured me and caused so much pain and trauma through recovery and robbed a bit of my life.\" but to think this way is to be eaten up, for life. To have compassion for the shark does not mean to say \"What happened was okay\", nor does it mean \"I'm friends with the bull shark\" or \"I'm letting them into my life\". Bull sharks are still dangerous. All compassion for the shark means is:\n\n\"This shark is deeply unlucky, because it is a shark. It cannot understand. It is doomed to harm others.\"\n\nNarcissists are exactly like this. They are unlucky to be narcissists. They *do* deserve love and a decent life, but can't ever find it no matter how hard they try because their brains can only produce narcissistic thoughts and behaviors. Just ask yourself for a second what it *means* to be a narcissist? It means you can't wake up one day, and say \"Wow! I was such a wicked, awful, selfish, and abusive person all of these years. I am *sick* to my stomach. Time to turn over a new leaf!\" This is just not how it works, and makes about as much sense as a bull shark suddenly behaving like a seal. Narcissism is really just a curse, which robs certain mothers and fathers the chance to ever experience genuine bonds with their children. If we had a magic wand, and could free them, we would. **We'd** be the evil ones if we said, \"You were unlucky to have the life and brain of a narcissist, now your punishment is we *won't* give you the cure! HAHAHA!\" That's how *narcissists* talk.\n\nUnfortunately, the happenstance of their lives turned them into dangerous monsters that have to be avoided -- **your safety, stability, and wellbeing comes first**, but the specific view here that distinguishes us from them is the ability to say they deserve to experience life as someone who isn't a narcissist. That, is compassion.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1566388568,"distinguished":null,"edited":1566397538,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"exkgcn1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ct5o1c","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_ct5o1c","permalink":"\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/ct5o1c\/compassion_towards_the_narcissist_is_endangerment\/exkgcn1\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575196770,"score":0,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

The unintuitive fact is,...\n\nIt does not matter *how* good things would be.\n\nBecause not being, is **always** going to be superior, in NU terms. We don't need the tools to calculate it, because we know that non-being is a flat zero. And we know that being is an unknown. Being *could* be a flat zero too but, we know that's also not true in a scope-sensitive way, right? Because suffering is utterly rampant, and there's no reason to think that suffering will hit zero tomorrow and remain at a static zero. However, we **do** know that non-being **is** a static zero. There's no truly sensible way to argue in favor of creating something that does not exist, in light of that fact that there's zero harm in non-being. The reason we push away from this is purely a result of our death denial, wishful thinking, optimism bias, ego, and so on. What amounts to, \"We *need* to fill our happy world so *we* can be happy even though there is *zero* guarantee for sustained happiness given our sheer ignorance of the potentially(likely?) sadistic nature of reality.\"\n\nPeople have this intuition that a utopia would be so amazing that *obviously* we should mass procreate in a utopia, right? Yet there's just no guarantee that the nature of being *suddenly* changes for the worse. We have to admit scope insensitivity here. Notice how scope insensitivity is not a problem for those who do not exist? We have a fear-response to the thought of non-existence, due to ego. It is however the **perfect** condition for a potentially conscious being to be in, and if this is understood by all conscious beings, then it becomes really just a god-like, perfect, impenetrable, protective concept where no harm could possibly occur.

This has been the thing occurring before our very eyes forever. This is also the core domination strategy of the workplace: **No unions**. \n\nNot just divide individuals, but divide **groups**. Groups who share a common oppressor: The very tippy top point of the pyramid. This is a highly simplified way to see how the performance goes: certain groups are engineered to hate and fear other groups(fear in general is a powerful narrative for running your society -- it's why the news is flooded with fear, lots of various utility here. Never forget this: Fear motivates **action**. The state wants you to **act**.). This narrative of \"you two *should* be fighting\" is constantly instigated and tiny fires are lit everywhere. This is *mostly* a strategy used to seed discord in *enemy* superpowers, but also one's own. To understand this just think of *two* pyramids that represent superpowers, divided into 3 slices. Bottom, middle, top. One pyramid may want to cause chaos in the other pyramid, by pitting bottom vs. middle. As bottom and middle fight, people are not happy. People are not happy, they are not productive, the top suffers losses. The top is then forced to work on managing order. Meanwhile, the top is also in a sense trying to maneuver this chaos, which was engineered by the enemy pyramid, as opportunity to enact short term and long term plans, which are constantly being adapted. The same is being mirrored in the enemy pyramid. So each top of the pyramid is trying to manipulate the bottom and middles of their own, and their enemy's pyramid. When you think about how old this idea could possibly be of state management and \"The proto-game theory of taking over the world\" you will realize it is probably as old as the pyramids themselves.\n\nThe world is just a matrix of stories and fictions and invented conflicts, while tops of pyramids play a shadow game where *anything* goes-- as long as it **wins**.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1566440374,"distinguished":null,"edited":1566467852,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"exmvfo2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_ct1huj","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_exms4jr","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/ct1huj\/a_man_died_yesterday_and_no_one_cares\/exmvfo2\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575238542,"score":2,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

You already know what natural selection more or less means: The most cunning, powerful thing which employs a strategy which 'wins at **all** costs'(winning here means sitting at the most relevant hierarchy and across as many hierarchies as possible), wins. \n\nIt's not about *humans* in general becoming conscious of their suffering, since the higher up you go in human hierarchy, suffering is *embraced* and celebrated. Humanity and other animals are martyred on a second-by-second basis for the purpose of human progress. This has been happening the moment apes began to battle for dominion over the earth, and for over all other apes. In a broad sense this has been happening since bacteria, since fish, since the time of the dinosaurs. This is a game, with a leaderboard, and we cannot know who sits at the top, because the higher up you sit, the more [camouflaged](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ri1sTPL.gifv) you are, since everyone wants to destroy the thing at the top. To the victor, go the spoils. That's the name of the game when it comes to gladiator warfare, as Inmendham puts it. Not only win, but win as **big** as you possibly can.\n\nThere are many tools to win. Camouflage is an obviously strong trait, or 'phenotype'(the expression of genes in behaviors). Another phenotype is psychopathy, which can be thought of as a \"winner's toolkit\". Psychopathy is everything about an individual that enables them to dominate, be callous, be self-absorbed, deceive, manipulate and charm, among other things. It's a combination of things which lets you rise to the top. It's the thing which makes the worst guy, look like the best guy. The most evil, appear the most good. It's *amazing* for survival. You can think about it like the perfection of social camouflage, because it gains you trust, prestige, makes you desirable(both to people and to mates), gets you power, wealth, etc etc.\n\nYou can't beat this phenotype without *having* it yourself, because what you're fighting is simply not playing by the rules. It's lying, it has this desire to crush you and own you, which you by definition, lack. You won't lie whenever it suits you, because you're not a terrible person like society teaches you, presumably. You won't be callous and murder people who get in your way if you can get away with it(since you're also cunning and deceptive and charming). The whole phenotype perfects the acquisition of power. And the perfection *of* this phenotype, is what owns this reality. Conclusion: Evil wins.\n\nThe second part of this, involves physics. Specifically, the 2nd law of thermodynamics, which is entropy. Entropy means stuff breaks down from order, into disorder. There could be pockets of order here and there, but there's still this trend for breakdown. Entropy, is part of the reason why it's easier to break something than to fix something. If I build a treehouse(power), and there are no ladders, and you *need* a ladder to get into my treehouse in order for us to fight in a power game, you need to build a ladder. You can build this ladder, and prop it up, and begin to climb it, but it takes me far less effort to just set your ladder on fire. After your ladder is on fire, you're forced to treat any injuries you have, and then start thinking about a way to not only build ladders, but fireproof them. In the mean time, I'm hardly inconvenienced, and I can use my treehouse to carefully study you and create a simple plan to ruin yours. Sometimes my solution will be *stupidly* simple after you've invested lots of energy and resources, like simply kicking the ladder out at the last moment. The fact that I always have this huge advantage due to a power imbalance means I have tons of free energy, resources, time, etc. I use this to work on getting even *more* power(like expanding my treehouse, attracting people who see my power and want to be on the winner's team), etc. Now, someone *could* kill me. This is a hierarchy, after all. I will eventually die, as well. But someone *will* take my place and take over this treehouse supercomplex. My children, or the children of the best psychopath in the tribe. But over time, this will get stronger, and stronger, and stronger, since the game only gets more and more advanced and requires more and more cunning, which distills psychopathy, which in turn crystallizes evil's grip on reality.\n\nThe ultimate conclusion here is 1) evil only gets stronger the farther one finds themselves from the big bang in spacetime. Just to explain *how* doomed this is: Even if you had a magic wand today which let you freeze time for 10 seconds and in that 10 seconds, *anything* you said would be consciously believed by everyone on Earth, and you said \"Nothing is more important than ensuring the total eradication of life on Earth\", then:\n\n* natural selection + entropy would provide a 100% guarantee that this project would fail.\n\nAnd that's if **everyone** agreed, which clearly, they will not. The trend I discover when I examine this reality, is that it always seems to get *much* worse than one imagined. Notice the contrast to this, and the narrative of cultures and societies? Things are improving! Things are getting better! Scientific and moral progress!\n\nAll of this is in fact an illusion, which serves to obscure the evil that is most certainly operative due to natural select+entropy.

Pain as a core issue, whether physical or psychological, is not the problem here. The problem is the nature of reality which *causes* pain. Natural selection, self-replicating systems, entropy, and game theory are the reasons why everything suffers today. To turn off pain would be to descend deeper into delusion about what the precise nature of this reality is. Pain, whether physical or psychological, is an important signal that gives one the hint: \"You *may* just be in hell right now.\"\n\nTo treat this as the problem, is to only obscure the part of reality that *causes* pain and suffering. This is the problem with modern day anti-depressants and other psychiatric drugs meant to reduce mental states deemed 'negative'. They are not a solution. It's like being in a box designed to torture you with robot arms armed with kitchen knives for the purpose of doing quality control for a company that sells serial killers kitchen knives in SerialKillerWorld, stabbing you repeatedly, and then simply introducing nanobots to repair any broken tissue, while resupplying blood via transfusions, and turning off your nervous system so the knives entering your flesh feel like someone poking you firmly with their finger. The scenario is *still* a nightmare, turning off the specific negative character of the experience is not a solution. There's even a very serious cost that should not be celebrated: You are *robbed* of the uniquely hellish character of your world. The *correct* feedback is immense pain and suffering. If you could somehow escape from this scenario as a result of your deeply painful environment, you would.

I'm just having fun here and speculating on yawning is all, sorry if this sounded more serious than it was.\n\n&gt;I\u2019m just not seeing how \u201cworks within a species and has enough utility to not vanish\u201d means it will work across species, which apparently is what you\u2019re saying?\n\nHmm if I suggested the inter-species utility was a reason why it didn't vanish earlier, then I've already corrected that in my last post(The correlation =\/= causation bit). The core of what I'm saying is really the intra-species utility, we can completely ignore the working across the species part for now, and the initial reason for why yawning could have utility would still stand(as far as I see).\n\nThe most parsimonious explanation for the inter-species part has probably got something to do with yawning starting in a common ancestor, and then continued to work as species branched from this ancestor. The fact that it could work between two different species is a happy little accident mostly( although couldn't there still be the inter-species de-escalation I described, if yawning has this effect?), because the same mechanism-- mouth wide open, eyes closed, long drawn-out exhale-- these things occur in all yawners, no matter the species. They should have the same effects(modulo differences in species) on blood oxygen\/blood pressure\/nervous system etc. \n\nI don't only think this could be helpful in tense situations, perhaps de-escalation is still not the best word because it can mislead to suggest that the situation was *necessarily* escalated? Even in relaxed situations it seems like it would be beneficial for everyone to mirror yawning. All you need is a brain that says \"yawn when you see yawning\" because everyone benefits, either via de-escalation, or via strengthening the conditioning for future de-escalation. Everyone in the future will presumably yawn too, like the animal you want to de-escalate with later.

Children are very smart, and amazingly good bullshit detectors since they're little detectives. They're piecing together reality bit by bit and making sure *every* detail logically coheres with the others.\n\nUnfortunately, they are fed a steady diet of propaganda that tells them there are good guys and bad guys, and while it may seem bad sometimes, good wins over evil in the end. This point is drilled into their heads even past adolescence and throughout adulthood. Unfortunately, this is all a lie. Evil wins. Evil has *already* won. It has a stranglehold on the world, and we are in a hostage situation that cannot be resolved. You *must* work, or die. You must excel, or lead a miserable life. You must be a monster, or monsters will abuse you. You can be sacrificed for the greater good at any time, because you are expendable. Your life has value insofar as it's not an inconvenience to the owners of this world and generates consumption in the system.\n\nWe'll never simply treat reality as is. Why? Why complicate things so much? Is it to protect the children who would be traumatized? Not... really. We do **lots** of things that traumatize children. We **intentionally** traumatize children in various ways, from infancy. The first thing an infant gets, in fact, is trauma, in the form of a slap from the Doctor. This tells them: \"Welcome to pain.\"\n\nWe don't tell them because we need children to be naive optimists, since optimism bias is an adaptation. If they become pessimists or nihilist or cynics or misanthropes, this is a problem because the optimistic, self-deceiving society next door will come in and destroy the burnout civilization that is honest. The ideal civilization from a king's point of view, is one where everyone in the kingdom is deeply optimistic, positive, but at the same time, deeply lying to themselves. Lying about how hellish the world is. Lying about how they are, deep down inside, murderous hateful sadistic psychopaths.

The message that I've been seeing across history, for thousands years including up to the present is something like this:\n\nGood and Evil are real. People are naturally good, but Evil corrupts. There may be some struggle in the story, but in the end, Good wins every time. The End.\n\nThis is the prevailing narrative in the world, everywhere-- not just Hollywood, HBO, Disney, etc. I argue this narrative benefits someone. But who could it possibly benefit? If this is a lie, and people believe it, what does this shelter? It shelters evil. No one suspects that evil has been in power all along, because we *expect* good to win. \"Good wins\" has been drilled into us as children. All the historical wars, everything, the good guy won. But that's not how it works, right? We know that it works via something more like natural selection. The strongest thing wins. And what is the strongest thing? Is it... the most *good* thing? Well, no, that can't be true-- because the Good thing is held back by rules, that's what makes Good, Good. It can do certain Evil things, but doesn't, because that would be wrong. Right?\n\nSo if Evil has no rules other than \"Win\", wouldn't that favor Evil in terms of natural selection? What happens in nature? The relatively harmless herbivores become the prey of the amoral, sadistic [predators](https:\/\/youtu.be\/95c5GTp__AU).\n\nWe see something very similar in capitalism and today's work environment. This is why the archetype of the CEO is \"The Psychopath\". The charming, domineering, callous, \"win at all costs\" kind of mindset that plays the public and the investors and the employees simultaneously, with perfect efficiency. It's not about ethics. The CEO who plays by ethical terms, simply **loses** the game. Neither of us are naive enough to believe you can be an ethical CEO and win the entire world through capitalism, right?\n\nBut then, hmm-- If the *game* itself incentivizes those who perfectly win at all costs(We defined this as Evil -- Not bound by ethical rules) , this would mean that no matter what socioeconomic system-- whether Anarchy, or Socialism, or anything -- the guy sitting on the \"Throne\", is by definition, the most evil guy in the country-- because if there was someone more manipulative, more domineering, more callous, and perfectly good at hiding it with lies, manipulations, machiavellian schemes, and an enchantingly handsome\/beautiful\/inspiring charm, this person would simply overcome the current leader.\n\nIf we go back to the notion of \"propaganda\" , it becomes a little more obvious that when the game is rigged, the propaganda will be precisely as we see in the dominant media across all cultures: \"We are inherently good, evil exists, but will be defeated in the end.\" This is an ancient tactic, even religions tell this story. Humanity has been in a hostage situation for thousands of years here, by the most evil manipulators at any given point in time. The bad news is, *only* the most evil manipulators can win this game. The mandatory \"work or die\" model is obviously sinister and has to go, but I don't think this scratches the surface of what actually causes the world to be such a miserable place.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1566658691,"distinguished":null,"edited":1566663576,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"exyyse2","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cus5bb","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t1_exywt3l","permalink":"\/r\/antiwork\/comments\/cus5bb\/when_you_think_work_is_the_whole_purpose_of_life\/exyyse2\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575447705,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antiwork","subreddit_id":"t5_2y77d","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antiwork","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}

Doesn't this imply that something which one could call 'evil' must exist? If I was simply a moral nihilist or a moral anti-realist, wouldn't I save myself the trouble of typing all of that out and just say \"Who cares, it doesn't matter in the end\/Who cares, ethics can't be objectively true anyway\"? The original post was about ethicists, and someone said they were evil, so I added my own insights to this. I'm not sure this is as true as they say, ethicists to me seem mostly confused about ethics, rather than particularly evil, even though I do think humanity is to some degree ubiquitously evil. Selfish, sadistic to those they consider 'outsiders'(and even to insiders), lacking empathy, lying to themselves, lying to others, etc. The place to look for evil, is power. The more power there is, by definition, the more evil there is, because to get power, you need to break rules successfully, in a way that doesn't attract attention or cannot be meaningfully retaliated. Notice how incompatible being a truly good person is, with being a boss. You couldn't ruthlessly fire someone. You couldn't min-max profits and underpay your workers. If we judge the actions of a boss or a CEO in moral terms, their behavior is bad. Ruthless. Callous. Manipulative. Deceptive.

Either you acknowledge determinism, or not. You can't 'aggressively disagree' about involuntary eating methods being bad but agree that equally involuntary modes of operating in the world(torturing children for fun), are somehow genuinely bad. The only crucial difference is a higher awareness of what is going on, there is zero difference in how 'voluntary' they are. I tried to point this out to you with regard to your condition of evil 'recognizing' consciousness and how completely morally irrelevant it is, because you can't change it even if you recognize it. People insist on this idea of awareness in moral dilemmas because of an antiquated misunderstanding that people have free will.\n\n&gt; Perhaps I simply don't believe good, bad, evil or moral should be applicable in terms of causing pleasure\/pain for a perceived function reason.\n\nI agree with you that intention matters, and there is something distinct about someone doing something purely for fun and doing it because they need to in order to survive. But the way I treat this is with the thought experiment that goes \"What if they *knew*...\"\n\nWhat if you could give a pill to a shark that gave it perfect moral understanding, human level cognition and the ability to use language? How would it react to its own existence?\n\nAnother way to frame this is, suppose that your lungs weren't the organ that solely pumped oxygen into your bloodstream and exhaled Co2. Suppose instead, you belonged to a species that had to torture dogs for 3 hours to get your day's supply of oxygen. Now suppose you were lacking the ethical understanding you currently have-- no empathy for dogs, no acknowledgement of them as sentient beings. They were simply utility objects for you, like soap when you shower.\n\nImagine what would happen if we gave you a pill to understand the full scope and gravity of what you've been doing. Torturing so many dogs... just so you could survive. You would be sick to your stomach, right?

It's inconsistent to say that media pervasively brainwashes us (agreed that they do), but that science is pure.\n\n Ah, I don't think science is pure, we actually agree here as well. I think science can and is corrupt, we just aren't sure where. Psychiatry is a great example of a science-related field I think is a complete joke today. Modern medicine in general and the model towards health is very blatantly Malthusian when looked at from afar, as you've touched on, and I will return to.\n\n&gt;And so we have people like dawkins and his selfish gene. But before dawkins we had malthus, telling us war and famine were good because they killed people off. Current genetics dogma, as taught in univerisities, was in part made by malthus. My point is that the science is false as well. We currently live under great stress, and we are sick.\n\nSure, our world is designed in a Malthusian way because of the incentives. Each superpower is involved in a game that says \"The superpower who has the least Malthusian approach, loses.\" We are incentivized to \"Stress test\" our societies genetic capacity, creating the modern hell that exists today. I don't think Dawkins is in the same vein though, because the Selfish Gene exposes how rigged the game is. It doesn't say we *should* be Selfish, like Malthus says famine and war are good, his book is purely descriptive. Nature *is* in fact evil, and any non-Disneyfied examination will [demonstrate this](https:\/\/youtu.be\/95c5GTp__AU).\n\n&gt;Nature tv shows will tell us this is how it's always been, interspersed among segments on world war ii, how animals.have wars, how animals compete over every little thing, &amp;etc. It's important because those nature shows are a philosophy on life, viewed through the powers that be, who define the culture. \n\nThey have been competing. And if they were genuinely living decent lives, like Bonobos compared to Baboons, the moment the Baboons descend, the Bonobos die. The psychopathic phenotype de facto *wins* and is the privileged strategy in nature. This is undeniable. Evil wins, and distills itself as evolutionary time progresses. The powers that be control the **media**, and feed a \"nature is nice and cute and things end happily\" narrative. Here, the science is the honest one. And even an honest depiction of science here is rare. It's always some sort of propagandized musical score or narration to downplay the fact that this is a meat grinder if colossal suffering.\n\n&gt;by correcting one's.own physiology, we have the opportunity to take the good things from our era (materials, information) and at the same time reject the perverse philosophy of life. There's a lot of \"evil\" in disney movies as well.\n\nI'm much more cynical and pessimistic. While yes, evil is depicted in all Disney movies, it always loses in the end. This conditions the child or adult to believe this is how the world works. Except this is precisely the opposite of how our world works. Every peasant has been lied to since the dawn of time by these stories, because it keeps morale up. It prevents the peasant from associating the king as evil. It justifies all the costs of wars for the winner. \"It had to be this way, we had to drop the nukes, to win, because we're the good guys, and good wins, after all.\" History is won by the strongest, most evil, most manipulative and cunning and dominating thing.

They learn this little trick early on, by accident, and then from there the child becomes an emotional blood bank for the narcissist. The parent becomes the center of attention, and dangles validation and emotional fulfillment like a carrot on a stick in front of the child for life.\n\nNarcissists frequently do this kind of role reversal to parasitize their children.

Paranoia is simply an evolutionary strategy for interpreting reality. Individuals high in pattern-seeking, are detecting more patterns than individuals who are low in pattern detection. Things will seem more profound. This can simulated with drugs that increase patternicity(the tendency to see patterns everywhere), like marijuana or other dopaminergic drugs. \n\nThe way I think of paranoia is like a kind of slot machine, with very bad odds(So, just a regular slot machine). Every thought an individual who experiences paranoia has, is like pulling the lever on the machine. Since the machine has bad odds, most of their pulls will be miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, etc.\n\n*Occasionally* however, and depending on how rigorous the paranoid person is and equipped with rational thinking tools they are, they can in principle get some pretty big jackpots. These hits will be a kind of esoteric knowledge which no one else may be able to know. The paranoid individual cannot be *certain* of their truth in the same broad sense that we cannot be certain of anything, but the thought will make so much sense, and when believed, it would essentially be no different from being right through highly rigorous means, and could lead to an even bigger grounding in reality from an stroke of luck.\n\nAn example of this would be, imagine if you were alive 2,000 years ago. Imagine if through some crazy paranoid thought you imagined everything living thing changing and morphing, and then imagined gradual generational changes, and more or less arrived at an idea that was very similar to Darwinian evolution by natural selection. Of course, 2,000 years ago, no one on Earth would be equipped to take you seriously. The evidence or rational argument you could have after believing this proposition through a paranoid thought of yours would not scratch the surface of whatever superstitious or religious beliefs that were operating at the time(they could even get you killed or imprisoned). By being right by accident, you can essentially scaffold the truth onto your representation of reality. Once you reach this \"shortcut\" to the truth, which you arrived at not by careful scientific study but by a random, crazy thought that *happened* to be right, you can look at reality while believing this thought and everything will fall into place, because you happen to be correct. As long as you're not following up this paranoid thought with more paranoid thoughts, but rather rational approaches, you don't have bad odds for discovering profound truths.\n\nThe gradual evolution of wings could be clear to you, the reason why all mammals have uncannily similar bone structure and physiology could be clear to you, the diversity of roughly similar yet distinct animal types could be clear to you, etc. This doesn't have to be a huge, scientific idea. It could even be an insignificant fact about reality, like \"My spouse is cheating on me\" when the lie is perfectly orchestrated-- the only way to truth here could in fact be through paranoia first, because otherwise further truths cannot be scaffolded without an overzealous first premise. We can be reasonably sure that purely as a result of probability, there are paranoid individuals, schizotypals, and schizophrenics alive today who have discovered some profound truth about reality and we'd all think they were crazy, but they are correct. Correct by accident, but still correct. In these cases, this changes paranoia from a highly stigmatized, negative symptom, to really more like a conditional superpower which one can't control. It's still true that paranoia is largely a symptom with anti-social and neurotic effects, but it's not perfectly understood as far as I can see.","can_gild":true,"can_mod_post":false,"collapsed":false,"collapsed_because_crowd_control":null,"collapsed_reason":null,"controversiality":0,"created_utc":1567205394,"distinguished":null,"edited":1567232918,"gilded":0,"gildings":{},"id":"eymcpk1","is_submitter":false,"link_id":"t3_cx5ksg","locked":false,"no_follow":true,"parent_id":"t3_cx5ksg","permalink":"\/r\/Schizotypal\/comments\/cx5ksg\/what_are_the_benefits_of_being_schizotypal\/eymcpk1\/","quarantined":false,"removal_reason":null,"retrieved_on":1575851057,"score":3,"send_replies":true,"steward_reports":[],"stickied":false,"subreddit":"Schizotypal","subreddit_id":"t5_2wlzo","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/Schizotypal","subreddit_type":"public","total_awards_received":0}
