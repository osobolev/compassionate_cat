Here I think the Christians have always been correct, and secular thinkers are asleep. I'm relatively convinced that humanity is inherently evil, simply as a result of some very simple features of the universe we find ourselves in. These features are:\n\n1) Entropy(The idea that things trend from order-&gt;disorder)\n\n2) Self replicating, competing social systems\n\n3) Spacetime\n\nEvil will naturally evolve in such a universe with 100% accuracy. The first step to understanding this is to treat what unfolds in such a universe as a game. A game is simply a rule based, dynamic system. I don't mean 'game' in the recreational or entertaining sense, but it's true that things like traditional sports and games are rule based dynamic systems, and sports will be helpful to illustrate how evil naturally arises in our universe. Cheaters will always have the edge, given enough time, in any game where there is no policing. Evolution has no rules other than \"Win\". Winning in this context means spread your genes at all costs. Features which help you win, are referred to as \"adaptive\". Survival\/Win promoting. Features which make you lose, are referred to as \"maladaptive\", bad for survival\/winning.\n\nIf we look at nature, we see endless cruel adaptations. We see insects which burrow into other live things, causing immense suffering. Why does this happen? Because it 'wins'. The parasitic victim's body serves as nourishment. Nature doesn't *care* if a poor puppy suffers here, because botflies have developed a winning strategy of laying eggs into the puppy's flesh.\n\nFrom the perspective of ethics, this is all obscene. What if the botfly could feel empathy? Guilty? Concern for causing others harm? Surely, it would find somewhere *else* to lay it's eggs. But if we look back to the perspective of nature, having concern for others is a bad strategy, which is why we see ethical \"cheaters\" all over nature. Being ethical is maladaptive. Being unethical is adaptive, because you're unlimited in your 'moves' in the 'game'. An ethical individual says \"No, I won't go there.\" An unethical individual not only doesn't care, but will be good at *hiding* it.\n\nNow think of a human game. Imagine your favorite sport-- this works with anything but let's pick soccer. Imagine if Lional Messi had to compete against a perfect clone of himself, except this was \"evil\" Lionel Messi. What does this mean? A version of Lionel Messi who was the exact same except **much more**:\n\n* Domineering(a strong drive to rule over others)\n* Callous(A lack of empathy)\n* Self-absorbed(Egocentric, indifferent to others)\n* Manipulative(Endless tricks, constantly keeping others in a state of uncertainty)\n* Deceptive(A pathological and skilled liar)\n* Charming(Had an attractive warmth to him that made others feel comfortable and compelled them to believe everything he says)\n\nThis is simply a description of the \"skill set\" of psychopathy, which is an evolved system that lets one win social games. It may sound uncanny to read this description, because these traits in their perfected form is what a Christian would refer to as 'Lucifer'.\n\nBack to Messi vs. evil Messi -- the first thing to note is many of these traits to various degrees are *already* present in the real Messi! These are *great* features to have when it comes to being the best soccer player alive(Not to be an ethical and moral person!). What happens when a perfected version of these traits is *added* though? The new, evil Messi simply destroys the normal Messi. Now, perhaps normal Messi can win a game here or there. Flukes can occur, right? No one is perfect. But when you think in evolutionary time scales of billions of years, normal Messi stands no chance. It's like expecting a rigged coin which lands on heads 90% of the time, to land on tails most of the time, after a googolplex(1 followed by one-hundred zeroes) of coin flips. It's *practically* impossible.\n\nThis is precisely the universe we live in. By the time humanity evolved to it's current state called homo sapiens, we've had been through a meat grinder colosseum of psychopathic selection which *favors* what you would call Luciferian traits -- psychopathy. Being a great liar gets your farther than being truly honest(Politics anywhere on Earth is all the evidence one needs to admit this) This is also supported by the game theory in the [Prisoner's dilemma](https:\/\/www.technologyreview.com\/s\/613585\/prisoners-dilemma-shows-how-exploitation-is-a-basic-property-of-human-society\/, where exploitation is a winning strategy. It's simply inside all of us to varying degrees, because we're been through so many millions of years of brutality, murder, rape, torture, lies, cannibalism, all swept under the rug of history, just to get to this point. Countless honest and meek life forms died because the ape which was willing to bash a rock over the other ape thrived, while the less unethical victim perished. Has this brutality gone away? Of course not. It's simply well hidden, which is a *feature* of the universe we exist in, rather than a bug.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"TrueChristianMeta","subreddit_id":"t5_391fx","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/TrueChristianMeta","subreddit_subscribers":123,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"A Non-Christian's interpretation and validation of Original Sin","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TrueChristianMeta\/comments\/cftiff\/a_nonchristians_interpretation_and_validation_of\/","whitelist_status":null,"wls":null}
