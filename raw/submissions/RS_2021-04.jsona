Why were Nazis, the masters of propaganda, so interested in the idea of engineering UFO memes? Because they deeply understood that ideas control people. This is why they had \"God with us\" on their belt buckles, this is why they had \"Work sets you free\" on the entrance of Auschwitz. The Nazis were *not* unique in their turning propaganda into almost an art form-- the vast majority of religions essentially do this.) \n\nThe purpose of this meme? An adaptive expression of a power hierarchy. In so far as the thing \"above you\" in the hierarchy dictates a false reality, they have a power over you. If I tell you that Santa is watching you and may reward you or punish you, in so far as you believe this, I can manipulate you. If a King invents a meme that they are the servant of God on Earth, and God is the infallible dictator of right and wrong, that King literally does whatever they want. This is what \"winner humans\" discovered(by accident or intentionally-- this works either unconsciously *or* consciously, that's the magic of evolution) was possible **thousands** of years ago. The only difference is, the memes are more sophisticated today. The probability that we are in a simulation is therefore lower than the probability that this is simply a meme used to control a slightly more intelligent bottom rung of our species, who no longer can sustain a belief in God, given how patently obvious of a lie it is.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"AWLIAS","subreddit_id":"t5_2vmwn","subreddit_subscribers":20278,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Occam's Razor towards The Simulation Hypothesis","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":0,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.71,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/AWLIAS\/comments\/mqnrym\/occams_razor_towards_the_simulation_hypothesis\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}
