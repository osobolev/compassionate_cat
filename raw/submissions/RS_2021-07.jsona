ancestors invented ideas that were simplistic, and often wrong: A perfect, all powerful, all knowing being invented everything, including us, animals, and the Earth, and this being wants us all to behave in certain ways. If we behave, then we'll be rewarded forever when we die. If we misbehave, we'll be tortured forever when we die. This beings instructions for how to live can be found in books written thousands of years ago.\n\nThere is zero evidence that any of the above is true. This is pretty obviously an idea that was invented because its utility for smarter, more powerful, more deceitful monkeys, to control weaker, more naiive monkeys, was unmatched at the time. The less powerful and more naiive monkeys got the peace of mind of maybe thinking their immense suffering could go away, there were incentives for the more malicious, weaker, naiive monkeys around them to not outright murder them out of fear of going to hell, so that was \"a win\", and of course, the kings, priests, rulers, etc-- got to utterly dominate the narrative and structure reality as they see fit. Everyone won a little bit somehow, but in doing so, everyone lost in the ultimate sense, because this was all completely delusional and a relatively evil way to structure a society.\n\nThis is where the idea of \"Hell\" comes from. It's an idea invented by monkeys.\n\nNow we're here, in 2021. We have a subreddit called \"Are We In Hell\"? We have a thread on the frontpage asking what kind of music do you listen to in hell? This is not the hell that's totally devoid of good music it seems. And that's good. This is an area where there's a rare suffering asymmetry in the *other* direction. The absence of great music isn't really torture, it's just kind of \"meh\", right? But the *presence* of great music, that can be a truly profound and memorable experience. A world with nothing but noise is much worse than our world.\n\nBut in general, there are countless [scenarios](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FMepy_THcOg) that few people appreciate, that make our world [hellish](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Y-xnl-Z9mo). Our world is overt hell for a very significant number of [beings](https:\/\/youtu.be\/fZf9Pa_xeTw?t=175). But not all of them. As you're reading this message, the odds of your intestines being ripped out from your abdomen by some animal(or human, unfortunately) predator, are *extremely* low. The universe where that is happening, or could easily be happening, is far worse than our universe. Just stop and appreciate that.\n\nThis is why I think this black and white representation of hell and heaven is a unsophisticated idea, from people who were either engineers of malicious dominance memes like religions, or schizophrenic, or suffering some other cognitive failure. We should instead evaluate *where* our world is, on the heaven-hell gradient. This is actually harder to do than it may sound, because even if we take this question on in principle, were never quite know what's possible in practice. We don't know if this is the only world, so we don't know if this analysis is only applicable in principle(since in practice, there is but *one* world). We don't know if this is the best world in practice. Or the worst world. Etc. But at minimum it seems obvious that things could both be much better(and there appear to be some things almost everyone can do right now to make the world less hellish subjectively without being delusional), but it's also true that if you just use your imagination in the *other* direction, the direction which tends to not come naturally to pessimists like myself, you'll find that things could also be much, much worse.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"areweinhell","subreddit_id":"t5_yzbmg","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/areweinhell","subreddit_subscribers":1589,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"We're not \"in Hell\", but we are in a \"Hell gradient\" -- A newer way to think about bad universes","top_awarded_type":null,"total_awards_received":1,"treatment_tags":[],"upvote_ratio":0.85,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/areweinhell\/comments\/oiuems\/were_not_in_hell_but_we_are_in_a_hell_gradient_a\/","view_count":null,"whitelist_status":"some_ads","wls":7}
