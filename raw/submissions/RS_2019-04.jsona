All of these arguments, and neurotic thinking, it's all just a needless strain on your already challenging life having a person with a toxic disorder as a parent.\n\nAre you familiar with the bizarre and insanity-inducing feeling that would occur if you took 5 steps forward, hurt yourself bumping into an invisible wall, then retraced your steps and done this over and over again for years? That's the precise sensation of what it's like having non-**essential** conversations with a Narcissist.\n\n I scroll through the subreddit and just shake my head, imagining how much conversation occurs that is only detrimental to people who were raised by abusive people suffering from a toxic disorder. I'm not claiming some kind of insightful high ground here, it's a mistake I've made countless times, and still make. But I just want to remind everyone(And myself) that much of this conversation isn't fruitful. You can't reason with a narcissist. Arguing with someone who can't say, \"Come to think of it, you're right. I'm sorry.\" is just a pointless endeavor. Even chit chat - just why? You can't change them. Being more positive won't do it, because nothing is good enough to them. I'm sure there are cases where people are forced to keep up appearances, or are still remaining contact because it would hurt them somehow - let it be clear that's not what I'm referring to, and it's perfectly okay to do anything you can to survive with a narcissist in any way you can, and that includes talking. I'm just talking about the stuff that isn't absolutely essential. So do yourself a favor - Save your breath! Save your brain cells. You have more value than you were told by your toxic parent - and your time and mental energy need not be wasted on these people.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_id":"t5_2we9n","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/raisedbynarcissists","subreddit_subscribers":414378,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"You don't *need* to engage in pointless conversations with them.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/raisedbynarcissists\/comments\/bc854s\/you_dont_need_to_engage_in_pointless\/","whitelist_status":"no_ads","wls":0}

People don't process facts in a way that easily edits their understanding of the world and makes them more in touch with it.\n\nThe odds are high that a suicide note will not be understood as the author intends it. The bullies will not suddenly feel guilty after your suicide note. The neglectful parents will not suddenly realize they were cruel to you. Your friend who you struggled to connect with won't suddenly see you in a new light, they will simply frame your suicide and your note, in a neat box that validates all of their previous conceptions of you. \n\nI'm not arguing that all final communications are useless, just the social\/emotional kind.

It's badly designed, because the person or group which most successfully evades playing by the rules in the most covert way possible, wins \"The game\". The most dominant entities on the planet are competing with entities under them. Constantly in threat of being dominated, and constantly exercising their domination. If you simply imagine a world with only 3 entities competing for resources, country A, B, and C, you can easily see that if A plays by the rules, and B and\/or C does not, then A loses. The incentives are bad.\n\nYet, when A acts, when A declares war, say. Or when A's intelligence agency floods country B or C with drugs to subvert their population, or spreads propaganda, or spreads bio\/chem weapons covertly, or all the \"evil\" looking things that you see in the real world -- It looks... Evil!\n\nBut this is a failure of empathizing with these entities. Has anyone *actually* ever imagined what it's like to be in the position of these entities? Let's try it right now. Close your eyes. You're now appointed as the director of the KGB. Congratulations!\n\nYou are now playing a *really* shitty game. You're playing a game where you have to really worry about subverting your enemies, and **be** subverted, both internally and externally, because you're playing this shitty non-cooperative zero sum global game. Perhaps congratulations were premature...\n\nWhy are you playing this game? Why are we even here? Well, we evolved from animals who *also* happened to play shitty zero sum games, where covert domination with a facade of cooperation, was the de facto winning strategy, and as a winning strategy, it was naturally selected for through evolution, and that has not changed today.\n\nWhat can we do? Can we reform our country to be the good guys? The moment we do, we're screwed, We lose. The other guys aren't playing by the rules! We are **forced** to be assholes, or **lose**. Let that sink in fully. Stop reading, and for a full minute imagine this circumstance. Pick your favorite superpower(Hahaha), imagine yourself as the supreme Leader of said power, and now enjoy the neurosis of doing your job. It's not a fun time.\n\nOnce you understand that this is the nature of the world we live in, once you empathize with the people you're least likely to empathize with(It's not easy for me - I've been poor all of my life. I've resented the rich and powerful for most of my life.), you'll realize that it makes absolutely no sense to **hate** any given country. You can criticize their behavior, but even that isn't terribly easy given the rock-and-a-hard-place position they're in. Even in the worst case scenario. Let's imagine it. Imagine whoever runs the world today, is just as evil as you can possibly get to a real description of evil without escaping the boundaries of science and treading into magic-land. Even then, you can't really blame what are essentially... psychopaths( I guess? That's about as evil as nature gets within the bounds of science.), for behaving the way they do. No matter who it is you hate, China, Russia, the United States, or all of the above, it is completely irrational to \"hate\" any nation, corporation(same zero-sum game applies to them too),or really any powerful entity. Just to be clear, competing powers in the world cause unimaginable suffering, but the answer to the problem is to fix the incentives somehow, not to hate what are essentially robotic agents forced into a shitty game, and forced to play it in a shitty way.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"unpopularopinion","subreddit_id":"t5_2tk0s","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/unpopularopinion","subreddit_subscribers":597561,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Hating the United States is just as irrational as hating Russia or China.","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/unpopularopinion\/comments\/bia99b\/hating_the_united_states_is_just_as_irrational_as\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}
