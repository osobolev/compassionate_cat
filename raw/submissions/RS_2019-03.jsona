Just imagine an earth like planet where resources are scarce, where beings like ourselves have coalesced into just 3 big tribes. They dominate each other to figure out who rules their tribe, and then it's dominate other tribes, or be dominated.\n\nSay you're the king or queen of one such tribe.\n\nYou want as many people as possible, because then you have a stronger economy, more potential soldiers in the most desperate of times, and most importantly, each person represents an exponential chain of future people. Likewise, if your advisory council proposes a new tribal degree for you to pass or veto saying each tribe member can painlessly kill themselves if they find themselves to have a very unfortunate life, or are suffering due to disease, it's in **your** and the ruling body of this tribes' interest, to vehemently oppose such policies. Consider the opposition to: 1) Condom use, 2) Homosexuality, 3) Abortion, 4) Euthanasia(even in cases where you'd be a heartless monster to not let someone end their pain, it is opposed almost everywhere) on planet earth. All of these issues exist because of the incentive the ruler has for maximizing population strength.\n\nReligion is the means to enforce such taboos, but the core beneficiary is the ruling body of the \"tribe\".\n\nThis is why it always puzzles me when I see an individual-centric understanding of the problem of Antinatalism(and other related questions of human suffering), because it only makes sense when you see how maximizing life is an incentive from the perspective of the state.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_subscribers":29904,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"Why does everyone frame problems like Natalism\/Antinatalism or even Euthanasia from the perspective of the individual?","total_awards_received":0,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/b6bx00\/why_does_everyone_frame_problems_like\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}
