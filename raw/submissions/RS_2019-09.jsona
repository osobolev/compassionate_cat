This is an A.I. who, as its goal to make paperclips, converts *everything* into paperclips or paperclip making machines, including civilization and life itself. Could your home be made into paperclips? Could *you* be made into paperclips? The AI doesn't care about your wellbeing, it only cares about making **more** paperclips.\n\nIn this sense, DNA is very much like a paperclip maximizer. It's not an intelligence, but it is quite literally maximizing copies of itself with an almost circular logic behind its physics. All life is basically hostage to DNA-- a Lion and Elephant can't help but continue to reproduce and subject life to more [meat-grinding](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=95c5GTp__AU). We destroy the environment because our genes are saying \"Make more copies\". We destroy each other because our genes are saying \"Make more copies\". All of our incentives, all of our behaviors, are expressions of this DNA playing in the sandbox of planet Earth. Whatever made certain genes propel forward, is what shaped the genes that thrived, and this feedback between genes and environment produced the state of affairs today after 3 billion+ years of combat. The strategy is win at all costs, and this drive has a tendency to be stronger than our desire of sparing our own offspring of [immense suffering](https:\/\/youtu.be\/m_6Y5H9ngZc?t=88), or prevent expressing basic decency to [sentient life](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3315). The fact that we are seemingly hostile or friendly to each other, the fact that we get depressed or happy, the fact that parents abuse their children, the fact that nations formed and nations fell, the fact that we make and consume art, these are all products of expressions of the DNA of a certain ape species in their environments.\n\nThe genes don't care about *you*-- you are just a vessel for the gene to make more, better, genes. And you will behave towards others in ways that compete against other genes or promote the same genes, because *those* behaviors had adaptive benefit to genes, thus they were selected naturally. All of this robs us of both seeing reality clearly, and treating all sentience around us ethically. So for example, a parent may make life excruciatingly difficult for their child, but this is all just a strategy to groom them into being a fit gene carrier. A nation may declare war on another, but this is just the expression of genes dominating other genes and 'winning' in evolutionary terms, in the exact same sense that the lion is 'winning' while eating the elephant alive. There's a superficial story-telling layer we experience as subjects, ie, \"My child is lazy\" or \"My parent is an asshole\", \"This nation attacked us\/is a threat\" or \"These warmongering bullies killed us for resources\", and these are all true to some degree in a meaningful sense, but they're also confused because they ignore the evolutionary incentives for these behaviors. Tribalism is effective for mindless replication, because it had genetic advantages over non-tribalism. Nations exist because they're powerful, adaptive networks for the dominant genes inside them. [Strong political ideas](https:\/\/www.lesswrong.com\/posts\/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f\/politics-is-the-mind-killer) have poisoned clear thinking here since the first political ideas formed, but also made for strong groups-- being wrong *together* is a very powerful adaptive behavior-- this is even more pronounced in the age of the internet. An understanding of the motives of DNA can put a dent into this, but ultimately the most aggressive and viral ideas will win, not the most accurate or ethical ones. The moment we understand that we are hijacked by DNA, we can attempt to reduce the mindless replication via *realistic* strategies.\n\nI say reduce, because I don't think it's possible to ever stop it fully. To do that you would need to be 'fitter' than the most fit gene carriers which hold all the power, both physically in the most extreme sense, like deciding which nations get nuked or not, and ideologically in the sense of the memes they hold, ie, an idea like \"I\/we must rule the world at all costs\". The things which express something like those two phenotypes with the greatest success will win, even if they're unethical, even if they're wrong. Natural selection doesn't care about either ethics or truth. You can't win and be on the right side of truth and ethics unless it's via some sheer pro-social psychopathic accident, but it is possible to make small reductions by not reproducing and by spreading the meme that DNA is a mindless process that guarantees suffering since it only incentivizing what is effective for competition, and only superficially allowing moral progress, since the \"winners\", the \"power holders\", are always going to be the metaphorical 'lions' preying on the herbivores of our world.\n\nIn the words of Gary(InMendham), who has essentially always referred to DNA as a property which mindlessly replicates and destroys, ad infinitum, but has never explicitly connected the idea of a paperclip maximizer to DNA to my knowledge:\n\n&gt;\"**Life** is broken.

This is an A.I. who, as its goal to make paperclips, converts *everything* into paperclips or paperclip making machines, including civilization and life itself. Could your home be made into paperclips? Could *you* be made into paperclips? The AI doesn't care about your wellbeing, it only cares about making **more** paperclips.\n\nIn this sense, DNA is very much like a paperclip maximizer. It's not an intelligence, but it is quite literally maximizing copies of itself with an almost circular logic behind its physics. All life is basically hostage to DNA-- a Lion and Elephant can't help but continue to reproduce and subject life to more [meat-grinding](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=95c5GTp__AU). We destroy the environment because our genes are saying \"Make more copies\". We destroy each other because our genes are saying \"Make more copies\". All of our incentives, all of our behaviors, are expressions of this DNA playing in the sandbox of planet Earth. Whatever made certain genes propel forward, is what shaped the genes that thrived, and this feedback between genes and environment produced the state of affairs today after 3 billion+ years of combat. The strategy is win at all costs, and this drive has a tendency to be stronger than our desire of sparing our own offspring of [immense suffering](https:\/\/youtu.be\/m_6Y5H9ngZc?t=88), or prevent expressing basic decency to [sentient life](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3315). The fact that we are seemingly hostile or friendly to each other, the fact that we get depressed or happy, the fact that parents abuse their children, the fact that nations formed and nations fell, the fact that we make and consume art, these are all products of expressions of the DNA of a certain ape species in their environments.\n\nThe genes don't care about *you*-- you are just a vessel for the gene to make more, better, genes. And you will behave towards others in ways that compete against other genes or promote the same genes, because *those* behaviors had adaptive benefit to genes, thus they were selected naturally. All of this robs us of both seeing reality clearly, and treating all sentience around us ethically. So for example, a parent may make life excruciatingly difficult for their child, but this is all just a strategy to groom them into being a fit gene carrier. A nation may declare war on another, but this is just the expression of genes dominating other genes and 'winning' in evolutionary terms, in the exact same sense that the lion is 'winning' while eating the elephant alive. There's a superficial story-telling layer we experience as subjects, ie, \"My child is lazy\" or \"My parent is an asshole\", \"This nation attacked us\/is a threat\" or \"These warmongering bullies killed us for resources\", and these are all true to some degree in a meaningful sense, but they're also confused because they ignore the evolutionary incentives for these behaviors. Tribalism is effective for mindless replication, because it had genetic advantages over non-tribalism. Nations exist because they're powerful, adaptive networks for the dominant genes inside them. [Strong political ideas](https:\/\/www.lesswrong.com\/posts\/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f\/politics-is-the-mind-killer) have poisoned clear thinking here since the first political ideas formed, but also made for strong groups-- being wrong *together* is a very powerful adaptive behavior-- this is even more pronounced in the age of the internet. An understanding of the motives of DNA can put a dent into this, but ultimately the most aggressive and viral ideas will win, not the most accurate or ethical ones. The moment we understand that we are hijacked by DNA, we can attempt to reduce the mindless replication via *realistic* strategies.\n\nI say reduce, because I don't think it's possible to ever stop it fully. To do that you would need to be 'fitter' than the most fit gene carriers which hold all the power, both physically in the most extreme sense, like deciding which nations get nuked or not, and ideologically in the sense of the memes they hold, ie, an idea like \"I\/we must rule the world at all costs\". The things which express something like those two phenotypes with the greatest success will win, even if they're unethical, even if they're wrong. Natural selection doesn't care about either ethics or truth. You can't win and be on the right side of truth and ethics unless it's via some sheer pro-social psychopathic accident, but it is possible to make small reductions by not reproducing and by spreading the meme that DNA is a mindless process that guarantees suffering since it only incentivizing what is effective for competition, and only superficially allowing moral progress, since the \"winners\", the \"power holders\", are always going to be the metaphorical 'lions' preying on the herbivores of our world.\n\nIn the words of Gary(InMendham), who has essentially always referred to DNA as a property which mindlessly replicates and destroys, ad infinitum, but has never explicitly connected the idea of a paperclip maximizer to DNA to my knowledge:\n\n&gt;\"**Life** is broken.

This is an A.I. who, as its goal to make paperclips, converts *everything* into paperclips or paperclip making machines, including civilization and life itself. Could your home be made into paperclips? Could *you* be made into paperclips? The AI doesn't care about your wellbeing, it only cares about making **more** paperclips.\n\nIn this sense, DNA is very much like a paperclip maximizer. It's not an intelligence, but it is quite literally maximizing copies of itself with an almost circular logic behind its physics. All life is basically hostage to DNA-- a Lion and Elephant can't help but continue to reproduce and subject life to more [meat-grinding](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=95c5GTp__AU). We destroy the environment because our genes are saying \"Make more copies\". We destroy each other because our genes are saying \"Make more copies\". All of our incentives, all of our behaviors, are expressions of this DNA playing in the sandbox of planet Earth. Whatever made certain genes propel forward, is what shaped the genes that thrived, and this feedback between genes and environment produced the state of affairs today after 3 billion+ years of combat. The strategy is win at all costs, and this drive has a tendency to be stronger than our desire of sparing our own offspring of [immense suffering](https:\/\/youtu.be\/m_6Y5H9ngZc?t=88), or prevent expressing basic decency to [sentient life](https:\/\/youtu.be\/LQRAfJyEsko?t=3315). The fact that we are seemingly hostile or friendly to each other, the fact that we get depressed or happy, the fact that parents abuse their children, the fact that nations formed and nations fell, the fact that we make and consume art, these are all products of expressions of the DNA of a certain ape species in their environments.\n\nThe genes don't care about *you*-- you are just a vessel for the gene to make more, better, genes. And you will behave towards others in ways that compete against other genes or promote the same genes, because *those* behaviors had adaptive benefit to genes, thus they were selected naturally. All of this robs us of both seeing reality clearly, and treating all sentience around us ethically. So for example, a parent may make life excruciatingly difficult for their child, but this is all just a strategy to groom them into being a fit gene carrier. A nation may declare war on another, but this is just the expression of genes dominating other genes and 'winning' in evolutionary terms, in the exact same sense that the lion is 'winning' while eating the elephant alive. There's a superficial story-telling layer we experience as subjects, ie, \"My child is lazy\" or \"My parent is an asshole\", \"This nation attacked us\/is a threat\" or \"These warmongering bullies killed us for resources\", and these are all true to some degree in a meaningful sense, but they're also confused because they ignore the evolutionary incentives for these behaviors. Tribalism is effective for mindless replication, because it had genetic advantages over non-tribalism. Nations exist because they're powerful, adaptive networks for the dominant genes inside them. [Strong political ideas](https:\/\/www.lesswrong.com\/posts\/9weLK2AJ9JEt2Tt8f\/politics-is-the-mind-killer) have poisoned clear thinking here since the first political ideas formed, but also made for strong groups-- being wrong *together* is a very powerful adaptive behavior-- this is even more pronounced in the age of the internet. An understanding of the motives of DNA can put a dent into this, but ultimately the most aggressive and viral ideas will win, not the most accurate or ethical ones. The moment we understand that we are hijacked by DNA, we can attempt to reduce the mindless replication via *realistic* strategies.\n\nI say reduce, because I don't think it's possible to ever stop it fully. To do that you would need to be 'fitter' than the most fit gene carriers which hold all the power, both physically in the most extreme sense, like deciding which nations get nuked or not, and ideologically in the sense of the memes they hold, ie, an idea like \"I\/we must rule the world at all costs\". The things which express something like those two phenotypes with the greatest success will win, even if they're unethical, even if they're wrong. Natural selection doesn't care about either ethics or truth. You can't win and be on the right side of truth and ethics unless it's via some sheer pro-social psychopathic accident, but it is possible to make small reductions by not reproducing and by spreading the meme that DNA is a mindless process that guarantees suffering since it only incentivizing what is effective for competition, and only superficially allowing moral progress, since the \"winners\", the \"power holders\", are always going to be the metaphorical 'lions' preying on the herbivores of our world.\n\nIn the words of Gary(InMendham), who has essentially always referred to DNA as a property which mindlessly replicates and destroys, ad infinitum, but has never explicitly connected the idea of a paperclip maximizer to DNA to my knowledge:\n\n&gt;\"**Life** is broken.

When someone asks how you are doing, you had better be wise enough to reply, \u201cI can\u2019t complain.\u201d If you do complain, even justifiably, people will stop asking how you are doing. Complaining will not help you succeed and influence people. You can complain to your physician or psychiatrist because they are paid to hear you complain. But you cannot complain to your boss or your friends, if you have any. You will soon be dismissed from your job and dropped from the social register. Then you will be left alone with your complaints and no one to listen to them gratis. Perhaps then the message will sink into your head: If you do not feel good enough for long enough, you should act as if you do and even think as if you do. That is the way to get yourself to feel good enough for long enough and stop you from complaining for good, as any self-improvement book can affirm. But should you not improve, someone must assume the blame. And that someone will be you. This is monumentally so if you are a pessimist or a depressive. Should you conclude that life is objectionable or that nothing matters\u2014do not waste our time with your nonsense. We are on our way to the future, and the philosophically disheartening or the emotionally impaired are not going to hinder our progress. If you cannot say something positive, or at least equivocal, keep it to yourself. Pessimists and depressives need not apply for a position in the enterprise of life. You have two choices: Start thinking the way God and your society want you to think or be forsaken by all. The decision is yours, since you are a free agent who can choose to rejoin our fabricated reality or stubbornly insist on . . . what? That we should mollycoddle non-positive thinkers like you or rethink how the whole world transacts its business? That we should start over from scratch? Or that we should go extinct? Try to be realistic. We did the best we could with the tools we had. After all, we are only human, as we like to say. Our world may not be in accord with nature\u2019s way, but it did develop organically according to our consciousness, which delivered us to a lofty prominence over the Creation. The whole thing just took on a life of its own, and nothing is going to stop it anytime soon. There can be no starting over and no going back. No major readjustments are up for a vote. And no melancholic head-case is going to bad-mouth our catastrophe. The universe was created by the Creator, by damn. We live in a country we love and that loves us back. We have families and friends and jobs that make it all worthwhile. We are somebodies, not a bunch of nobodies without names or numbers or retirement plans. None of this is going to be overhauled by a thought criminal who contends that the world is not double-plus-good and never will be. Our lives may not be unflawed\u2014that would deny us a better future to work toward\u2014but if this charade is good enough for us, then it should be good enough for you. So if you cannot get your mind right, try walking away. You will find no place to go and no one who will have you. You will find only the same old trap the world over. Lighten up or leave us alone. You will never get us to give up our hopes. You will never get us to wake up from our dreams. We are not contradictory beings whose continuance only worsens our plight as mutants who embody the contorted logic of a paradox. Such opinions will not be accredited by institutions of authority or by the middling run of humanity. To lay it on the line, whatever thoughts may emerge from your deviant brain are invalid, inauthentic, or whatever dismissive term we care to hang on you, who are only \u201cone of those people.\u201d So start pretending that you feel good enough for long enough, stop your complaining, and get back in line. If you are not as strong as Samson\u2014that no-good suicide and slaughterer of Philistines\u2014then get loaded to the gills and return to the trap. Keep your medicine cabinet and your liquor cabinet well stocked, just like the rest of us. Come on and join the party. No pessimists or depressives invited. Do you think we are morons? We know all about those complaints of yours. The only difference is that we have sense enough and feel good enough for long enough not to speak of them. Keep your powder dry and your pessimistic, nihilistic, and defeatist temperaments in check.
