It made me recall my own experiences completely cutting off the narcissistic supply, and what ended up happening won't surprise you: She had an N-meltdown. The reason I'm posting today is just to encourage our members who are planning this strategy to please consider it strategically: Try to taper the Grey-rocking rather than \"Turning it on\" at all times. The goal with this is to avoid anything from high stress to yourself, or added abuse, violence, and so on if a meltdown occurs. We are dealing with mentally ill people and we have to tread carefully when we use techniques like this to survive. To start, try grey rocking a little bit here and then and test the waters. Then, slowly dial it up as you feel there's room to do. You can try to GreyRock cold turkey, but I don't think the risks are worth the gains for many of us, particularly with families that have immediately life-threatening and violent people in them. Err on the side of caution, and if you keep it up, you'll have completely de-programmed the narcissist to look to you for a source of N-supply in the safest, stress free way possible.

One thing is for sure, humans are dumb, and if humanity has a chance, Antinatalism is the sure path to permanently ruin any chance the human race has because it will select for monsters rather than compassionate people. There are those who will rejoice at this idea or simply lack empathy to care(the apathetic, nihilistic antinatalist), but those who are not quite as religiously certain should see cause for concern.","send_replies":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false,"subreddit":"antinatalism","subreddit_id":"t5_2ro3i","subreddit_name_prefixed":"r\/antinatalism","subreddit_subscribers":14400,"subreddit_type":"public","suggested_sort":null,"thumbnail":"self","thumbnail_height":null,"thumbnail_width":null,"title":"The best argument against Antinatalism is that sociopaths aren't concerned with Antinatalism.","url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/antinatalism\/comments\/97mfkn\/the_best_argument_against_antinatalism_is_that\/","whitelist_status":"all_ads","wls":6}

She is this absolutely broken woman, where no matter how much life insists that she is incompetent, just doesn't even scratch at her ego. She's approximately 72 years old now, had a masters degree in economics from Poland, was poor all of her life essentially after working hard in the United States in retail, and now is living on scraps yet hoarding massive amounts of food, she terrorizes people in grocery stores, just people stocking shelves and forces them to listen to her life story as they politely nod and humor her(I caught her doing this by sheer accident of going to the store). \n\nNow she's convinced she can apply to be some board member at a local bank. She has contributed nothing to economics in her entire life other than working at some scam job in the US that did cold calling for currency trade, which was shut down by the Feds after a short few years of operating, other than this, the woman is absolutely economically inept and has no clue what it even means to make basic intelligent decisions in a grocery store that your average 6th grader would be able to make.\n\nShe has been politely rejected her application to be a board member of this bank, but now has insisted that she's extremely qualified, and a large beige envelop full of a few hundred pages of petition letters are inside. I think she actually going to torture in the local neighborhood to sign ... requiring something like a few thousand signatures. \n\nI'm honestly more than concerned. I have no clue how psychologically destabilized this person is. I barely have something I can call a life at age 33, after years of manipulation, grooming, and neglect and have no where to go other than to a homeless shelter. But yeah... anyone who has been in this specific situation, your insight would be invaluable and very appreciated.
